Gosh this place is cool . I wish more people knew about it . Warehouse with a community of businesses is a fantastic idea . Food , festivities and funky vibes check DeSoto Market out !<->1
Awesome beer & great food ! In the summer , the outside patio is great . Unfortunately , the wait for the patio can get very long .<->1
Fries were cold and soggyHe dressed the burger before the meet was done so the bun was soggy too ... But this location is never busy cause its no good .. So you wo nt have to wait<->0
LOVE the crab cake - - For sure the best in the Valley ! Ca n't wait to go back ...<->1
Great hookah . great staff . But they started bringing this stupid DJ on the weekends like it 's a club instead of a relaxing lounge . I do n't even come anymore because of that .<->0
Excellent brunch joint , especially if you 're a football fan as they have viewing parties . Service is lovely , food is delicious , prices are reasonable - check it out .<->1
I absolutely LOVE Rockys ! They hook it up every time we visit ! Winning money here is GREAT and it happens all the time . I love his Bartenders ! We will always come here ! Wonderful Service !<->1
Great food . Especially after a night of drinking . Little overpriced in my opinion , as it 's been hit and miss when I 've gone but overall , worth it<->1
I went there for the AYCE lunch on a weekday . It was ok . Price was fair for what I ate . Pretty varied selection .<->2
Best . coffee . ever . Moving to Alberta and this will be one of my favourite missed places in Toronto .<->1
Amazing food , friendly staff , entertainment band . I recommend this to visitors and locals alike .<->1
What a treat ! ! Sooo decadent . We stopped for a snack and then could n't even think about dinner . Delicious hot cocoa .<->1
Authentic Chinese food . Flavor of North China . I am from South China but I am familiar with the taste of the north too . The lamb soup ( with noodle ) is excellent and is what you must try .<->1
Had a great time eating at this restaurant with my boys . I wanna thank the amazing staff especially Richie and Ronnie . They both kept up with our order , had outrglasses full , and small talk BSing about life .<->1
Went to this gem twice and impressed with the food and service both times . Duck wings were delicious and crisped just right . Pork pancake and another one of our favorite . Will be back .<->1
There is a review from Fhr I that clearly looks like a personal vendetta . So I had to step in to help this establishment with a review . Fun , inexpensive , good food local bar .<->1
This place is quaint , delicious , and the staff are so friendly ! It feels like I genuinely have a place to go that feels like a " neighbourhood " eatery . Every time my parents come into town , this is our first stop !<->1
I love everything on the menu . Try it all ! ! Great customer service every time I come here .. which is quite frequently over the last 8 years .<->1
Really good . Large portions , fast and friendly service , decent prices . This will not be out last time .<->1
We were there for lunch today and the food was amazing ! I tried the grilled octopus and it was TO DIE FOR ! Good service , good atmosphere , and amazing food ! Keep up the great work !<->1
Great stick to your bones food . Try the fried crab claws and fried gator . The service is spotty however , the food is great .<->1
Unsurprisingly underwhelming . Outrageous cost , as this is barely a step above a Golden Corral . Really disappointing . Only saving grace was their Banana Creampuff , and the hosting staff was very nice . Oh , and the mashed potatoes . Those were pretty good , too .<->0
Dude . We were here for a late champagne brunch , and left when it was dinner . That ' s 3 hours of eating ! ! http://static.px.yelp.com/photo/EZzESk6Qe_8YIYexzmOXaQ/lMoney well spent . My father taught me well . p . s . This buffet is vegan approved . Not that I am one or anything ...<->1
Amazing customer service ! From opening the door to picking up our trays ! Very friendly staff , clean , and good burgs . 5 stars<->1
The food is ok but the waitresses are AWFUL . We made the reservation for 6 but wait there for half hour and nobody seated us . What 's the point for reservation ?<->0
Been twice good service , food , and prices will be going back . Nice sized outdoor eating areas on street side and in back .<->1
The food is good . The atmosphere is good but pretty loud . The have somebody playing the piano . BUT THE SERVICE IS HORRIBLE ! ! !<->2
No different than any other Starbucks except that it is right on the street in downtown Tempe , making for a very nice environment to enjoy the bean .<->1
Excellent food , and great service . I ve had the gyro sandwich and the chicken shwarma plate . Both were very good . Definitely recommend .<->1
Ca n't go wrong with this place , I have been eating at In - N - Out since I lived in Cali . 16 years ago . and this is still my Favorite burger Joint.also make sure you get your burger " Animal style "<->1
$ 12 for a pitcher ! What ! ! Its my second time here but I ca nt remember if the food was that good . I guess it was nt memorable ? Easily forgettable ? Anyways , servers were entertaining . Would I go back ? Maybe for the drinks .<->2
Very spacious and has two entrances . Always clean and staff is usually friendly . Good hang out spot with easy access to shopping and eating .<->1
We were in the area , so stopped by for a quick lunch . Food was underwhelming and portions were small . There were only 3 tables , yet the service was extremely poor . Do not plan on coming back<->0
Went to the Creek for brunch , the bartenders Danielle and Billy " McLovin " , were great ! ! loved the Bottomless Mimosas ! !<->1
Love this place ! ! Delicious ! I just wish it was closer to my house . Other than that , I have no complaints . The price point is reasonable and the menu selection is great . Could n't ask for anything else !<->1
I had a green tea latte and they strawberries and chocolate waffle . Both were yummie ! ! !<->1
Awesome decor and environment . Food and drinks are outstanding ! The tocoa bowl is delicious and tastes like a home cooked meal . Definitely highly recommend !<->1
The panang curry with prawns was excellent . Chicken wings were pretty good . Crab wantons not so much .<->1
Great Food & Service . We 've never had such delicious food as we have here . Definitely take the waiters recommendations and enjoy ! ! !<->1
Awesome authentic Indian / Pakistani food . Very kind welcoming hosts , very affordable , do yourselves a favor and eat here !<->1
The owner started out installing and fixing espresso machines - so he knows his equipment . My espresso was fantastic . Highly recommended .<->1
Food is great , atmosphere fantastic , service could be better . Still a great regular spot in uptown for drinks and small plates<->1
Nice ambience , service and food . Offers both sushi and japanese style hot dishes . Reasonable price for lunch specials ( $ 9 + ) and all - you - can - eat buffet ( $ 16 at lunch , $ 24 for dinner , weekend nights are $ 27 ) .<->1
If I lived near here I would go everyday ! ( Okay not really , there only so much fried chicken a girl can handle . ) But , the friend chicken here is amazing ! Just go go go !<->1
Excellent menu and service . Had the private dinner in their special room with my colleagues . One of the best nights and food was spectacular ! Thumbs up !<->1
Located on W . Craig just northeast of rancho in the smith 's plaza . Sage sushi must be one of my favorite sushi spot . It 's delicious food and great service makes this sushi bar an outstanding place to eat .<->1
The Sonora style hot dogs are so good ! ! ! The other thing I like from here is the vampiros if you have n't had some you should definitely try it .<->1
Good beer and wine . I like the feeling of being in a real bar in the city . Difficult to find in Phoenix .<->1
This place is great . The food is very good . The mint tea is perfect . Take a large take out middle eastern dessert sampler home . That is a great weekday night meal . Simple but very very good .<->1
Delicious food and great owners ! Best kabob , everything is fresh , and the family is so great . Most definitely recommend for Richmond Hill<->1
Best in Vegas . Always friendly . Delicious food . Prices are very reasonable . The hash brows and bacon are sooo good . When I 'm forced to eat anywhere else I 'm always disappointed now and think o myself its not Mr Mamas<->1
Great food and great service . My only complaint is wrong NFL team ! Lol Highly recommend !<->1
Lovely little cafe . You 'll find amazing soy / coconut lattes<->1
I 'd say a fair MEH . Came for lunch buffet . Not sure worth it.some hit or miss items . Descend the escalator in PH<->2
Good food and an outstanding Apple Ice - T . Really good lunch specials two Meats for 999 . Try their creamed corn wo n't be disappointed<->1
Great Food , & All you can EAT :) Inexpensive TOO Great servers . only 4 stars because it 's a LONG Drive ... GREAT FOOD Tony Morello Mesa Az<->1
Portion size is a large size ! Food was wonderful . Patio had dirty tables , and disorganized seating . Service needs improvement .<->2
Just went there once but it was great . Gorgeous location , atmosphere , and everybody 's selection was delicious . Great Bloody Mary 's too .<->1
Non veg starters were good ... but Unbalanced spices .. fish curry tasteless ... Chicken biryani salt less of course spice less ... lemon shots too sweet ... overall i had very tasteless lunch ...<->0
Yesterday late night visit.got beef gyro platter not a good choice food was greasy blend and too much white sauce . Only thing i like is hummas .<->0
Food and customer service is always so good ... Love this place ... The ONLY downside is sometimes there can be a long wait ... worth it tho ...<->1
I am so glad we came here . It was amazing food , service , and environment . I would recommend this place to anyone .<->1
This place is all hype . Expensive , small patties , terrible service . Plus I ask for extra sauce ( see picture ) wtf ? Go to in n out .<->0
Bergies has a great location with excellent outside seating . I stop by weekly to buy fresh roasted beans and get a cup of brewed for the ride home . Excellent quality .<->1
Loved the pulled pork headwhiche ! Sometimes the wait can take a while if you go during meal times on weekends . I would recommend honey barbecue sauce for the chips that comes with the headwhices .<->1
Outstanding customer service . We had a minor issue with our order but the waitress and manager handled it extremely well . We have not experienced service this good in years .<->1
Screw this place . It used to be good until Panera took them over . I spent 15 minutes trying to get through to make a phone order and kept getting hung up on . Go elsewhere .<->0
Poor quality chicken . Everything tasted like dirty dish water . We paid our bill and left without eating .<->0
Great phone service . Promised delivery time . Cool delivery dude . CRAZY good food . I will be eating here again very soon .<->1
It was not crowded at all , food was amazing , and service was fantastic . Will be coming back !<->1
You must have the mushroom , walnut and spinach soup . It is amazing . Great service . Open late . New favorite spot in town .<->1
Yes this place is terrible I had a very dry chicken burger for high price . The iPad ordering system was stupid . Took me 10 minutes to figure out . Around me , 3 people left in frustration before ordering .<->0
Service : Average Chinese cafe service . Have to go to counter to use card ( debit and credit accepted ) Food : Bland and loaded with MSG.Lunch special includes tea or coffee , soup ( nasty ) , dish on rice ( bland ) and dinner roll ( warm and soft ) .<->0
This restaurant reminds me of an abusive relationship . One server was extremely nice and the other almost made my friend cry . Beside that the food was extremely authentic . We left with mystery meat stuck in our teeth .<->0
Always terrific service . No addition charge for extra flavoring . The prices are even better than " Starbuck 's " .<->1
Bon griot avec riz collé et bananes pesées , bel endroit , style boutique resto avec une douzaine de places assises .<->1
Awesome pizza for delivery . Top choice over pizza hut , dominos or any other pick up or delivery place . Prices are good too . They said it would be an hour but it got there in 30 min , no complaints with that .<->1
We went here for our anniversary and I could n't believe how great the sushi was ... In Arizona . The staff was friendly , the restaurant was clean and the area was cool . Very nice little spot . We will be back .<->1
After an average dinner , we Yelped this place and WOW what great Gelato . Must stop in Chinatown in Las Vegas . I had Pina Colada and Cheesecake Gelato .<->1
$ 2.99 for shrimp cocktails . WOW , best buttery pancakes I 've ever had . YUM . Wished I had room for dessert .<->1
very much a tavern with a very industrious feel . If in the area good tavern but i did not feel like it was a destination place for dinner .<->2
Go in hungry , leave unbuttoning your belt . All the meat is good , but the short ribs r ridiculous ! ! Add the 15 $ price and its the best deal in town ! !<->1
Delicious food . Last minute walk in . They suggested what we should eat ( vegetarians ) . The service was great , and the food was hot and tasty ! We got a family portions veg soup , and the avacado smoothie . Both were nice :)<->1
I took my mother there and had a beautiful day sitting outside . We had the pesto omelet which was very tasty and the Monte Cristo sandwich . Excellent . I plan to go back there with friends .<->1
Smelled so bad of dirty carpet and mildew , i turned around and walked out ! Went downthe street and had a great salad at O'Charley 's<->0
Delicious ! You will not be disappointed here . We frequent this place and I have n't had anything I did n't like . I often get take out as well . Order is always quick and spot on .<->1
Consistently friendly and tasty . A simple menu with no poor choices . I do like the complimentary baklava , it is a nice little touch .<->1
OMG ! ! Have n't had a burger like this in a while . LOVE IT ! ! ! And the Fries are fresh cut too ! !<->1
I was checking out with my delicious Frostberry Blast Xenergy and a younger lady snuck up behind me wearing space pants and I was startled beyond belief .<->1
Cute little diner - like restaurant in the arboretum with FREE WIFI if you ask for it :) Doing some work while waiting for my engine oil to be changed at Firestone !<->1
Under no circumstance should you eat here . The chicken tasted like shrimp ( look out if you are allergic ) , the noodles were bland , and the remaining dishes were terrible . Worst $ 12 I have ever spent .<->0
Cute lil spot . Love the fish to rice ratio . Fish quality is good . Their uni is not as creamy and a bit salty , but everything else was good . Finished off with a mini honey toast !<->1
This place rarely has anything you need in stock . The employees are nice but very incompetent . Do n't use store pickup , it takes longer than actually shopping .<->0
Always have a great time here . Got ta love those bread sticks .<->1
I had a strawberry wheatgrass smoothie .. I forgot to add boba , but it 's the best consistency for on the go . Amazing waffles and chicken . Fluffiest pancakes I 've had in forever<->1
Sub par . The woks and desserts were okay . Everything else was a fail . Never going back .<->0
Great salad selection and quality , AND there was room for my stroller at lunch which made my day !<->1
This is a fun place , although it 's usually pretty crowded parking can be difficult overall this is a fun place to visit and check out .<->2
Cheap and vegan . Usually those words do n't go together . It 's just your normal busted looking donut joint , nothing hipster about it ... just happens to have a ton of cruelty free options .<->1
Yes , you will eat breakfast here . And yes , you will leave smelling of grease . But your stomach will be full , your veins full of caffeine ... and you will smile and be satisfied ...<->1
Best in BBQ in Calgary for sure ! Easy in and out , do n't have to wait for a server . Order up and sit at a picnic table . Love it !<->1
Great service.food was wonderfull<->1
Was a weekly regular . They used to have awesome wings ( dry rub ) , but then they screwed them up and raised the prices . Stopped going as I could n't stand it .<->0
Great access , quick and friendly service . Good food and quick . Thank you Johana for your smile and heart .<->1
I went there based on Yelp reviews , and was n't disappointed . Other reviews captured this place well . It does n't look like much and feels very old , but the food is good , well above average .<->2
Taco Salad and the Chimichanga was huge portions . Fresh ingredients and not out of a can . Excellent food , service , place is very clean . Will definitely go back .<->1
We had breakfast there today . The guacamole was good a little heavy on lime and cilantro . The ground beef tacos were great ! ! Refills on the Arnold Palmers were appreciated . The Carne Asada had a nice flavor .<->1
Best pho in chinatown ! Huge portions and delicious ! Service is quick and the staff is super friendly ! My one and only pho place in downtown !<->1
Fantastic . This is the best lunch uptown . The wait staff was attentive and knowledgeable without being overbearing . The food exceeded my expectations by a long shot . I will become a regular here .<->1
Food was excellent ! Delicious and decent priced . Service was so slow though . Went on a Thursday night and waited forever for the check and drinks to be delivered to the table .<->2
By far my favorite Mexican place in the valley ! It has the safe , welcoming feeling of a big restaurant but the taste of authentic Mexican<->1
Would really appreciate 7 Numbers Danforth clearing their sidewalks of snow instead of throwing down a lot of snow .<->0
Fantastic pizza ! ! . charlotte : embrace the place or it 's not going to make it . Perfect crust , great sauce .<->1
The curry is absolutely delicious ! The tofu was great as well . The pad Thai taste bland . Overall , a good spot .<->1
Hm , did n't realize Bar Bianco had their own review page.http :/ / www.yelp.com/biz/pizzeria-bianco-phoenix#hrid:PvdncjR2V1mDcLIPIGJ73QIn short , awesome rustic feeling re - purposed house , smoking hot bartender woman , relaxed and comfy country style patio , and delicious Four Peaks on tap .<->1
The food was okay . The metal shard that I found in my takeout noodles ruined any good benefits though . Especially since I emailed them to let them know , and did n't hear anything back .<->0
Love the food ! Everything made fresh to order , Shish Tawouk , Soujouk Spicy Sausage , Vegetarian Platter & Delicious Lentil Soup . My go to place for Lebanese with a twist & with friendly service .<->1
Great place the guys will answer your question on beer fun place to hang and just taste some good beer<->1
Love this place are second time going there food was consistent and very good both times definitely worth the effort to find a place stay away from lunch time they get real busy<->1
I am in love with the spinach artichoke dip and the crab stuffed mushrooms . Which they serve with a buttery sauce that is amazing . Staff here has always been great and have never had a complaint .<->1
This place is great ! Good quality food and great service . I love that I can choose everything that goes into my burrito ! It 's like Chipotle But a true Mexican taco shop .<->1
The associates here are super friendly . They were patient with this newbie to this place . Took time to listen and wait for me to figure out what to order . They made the drinks quickly and they tasted delicious !<->1
I love it here . The food is excellent and the service is wonderful . A filet topped with lobster is incredible . Also , the place is beautiful !<->1
This is usually a busy location . I would pre order on mobile to skip the line up and just wait for your order to be called . Either than that , it 's just like any other Starbucks you would go to .<->1
Charlotte 's best pizza , IMHO . Not overly expensive either .<->1
Took forever to get my noodles . Service was good but they need to manage their cook orders better . Come if you have time to wait .<->2
The flavor and spices in the pad thai were good , but the dish overall was nothing to write home about .<->2
Best vegan donuts EVER . Scratch that , best donuts ever period ! Vegan or not you 'd never be able to tell what 's " missing . " You ca n't go wrong with any of their donuts .<->1
Wonderful ! ! They were really on top of my son 's food allergy and everything was great ! Our favorite meal in Vegas ! ! !<->1
Les crevettes Salt & Pepper ... miam miam<->1
Food was cold , The Mac & chesse we ordered was so cold at the bottom . So the waitress took it back . That was the only hot food . We ordered brisket an pork combo .<->0
I had heard of this place when I was 16 from a couple of chefs I worked with in MA ... I finally made it ! ! ! 22 yrs later ... eek ! It did not disappoint ! Pastrami and provolone sandwich with every thing ! ! ! Awesome ! !<->1
Great place , great food , great atmosphere , amazing happy hour prices . I highly recommend the catfish tacos and the french dip ! Definitely coming back soon !<->1
Sammy 's Woodfired Pizza is a good place to go for pizza ( duh ) and tapas . It is located in a very safe neighborhood . Parking is easy . Service is a hit or miss .<->1
Delicious food , good service . Probably the best Thai food I have ever had . Fresh ingredients , yummy sauces and perfectly spiced !<->1
AMAZING ! I had some at while visiting Nevada . I wish there was a stand here in L . A . ! It 's like shaved ice , sort of , but , BETTER .<->1
I would not compare this to Kansas City Style at all . Ordered a combo dish and could n't eat over half the meal due to being so dry and burnt . Would not recommend this location to anyone .<->0
Held a birthday party here . Great food & service . Erin was very helpful from start to finish . We 'll be back ! !<->1
Everyone here is cool as heck , food good and price is super sheep lol .. Ca n't go wrong w / this place . Do n't expect the world for $ 5.00 this place is what it is .<->1
Just had the pizza but it was GREATUpdate : I 've now tried a variety of dishes here and it never disappoints . I 'm a true New Yorker and Italian food like this is hard to come by in Charlotte .<->1
Fresh ! Tasty ! Excellent ! So good ! Ca n't wait to try another salad ! Had the Poncho Villa and my sister had the Athena . Both were delicious ! So glad we stopped here today ! 1st Time !<->1
This location was dirty . Sticky floors . The pancit was underwhelming , kinda bland compared to other locations .<->0
I love spicy food food but this was over the top ! They should have mentioned how spicy the dish was ... I could barely eat it . I ordered tacos and received enchiladas . I 'll never go back .<->0
Great early morning ( 6 - 9 ) breakfast specialThe food was yummy Omelets my favorite ! The customer service was wonderful ! ! Management was also respectful and accommodating<->1
Everything about this place , I loved . Curry Udon , Sea Urchin Udon , tempura and toro wrap ! Yum . No line at lunch . Go on a day off so you can enjoy with a beer !<->1
Not sure about Roman vs . Neopolitan , or low carb dough , but I know food and flavour . These guys ? They definitely know flavour and what do to with quality ingredients . Properly good food , done correctly ! Absolutely recommended .<->1
I had the best time . great food great service .. steaks Mmmmmmmmmm<->1
not bad , i like that their potatoes are not deep fried and full of grease , the trio is pretty good . I use to live in ottawa though so I have high standards for schawarma . Its ok ...<->2
I used to go to another nail salon where the price was just really high & my friend told me about this place & I 'm so happy I gave it a shot ! Jasmine is amazing !<->1
Good food , Montreal at it 's best ! ! The portions are generous and fresh . Must go place if you are in Montreal<->1
The salad that comes with the dishes are huge ! Also the lamp chops and fresh taziki and rice were all excellent . The feel is a little mom and shop type , but really authentic .<->1
Great Lunch Menu ! Calzones are large and full of meat & other goodies . The Gyro was also a great lunch item . Glad I found this gem , their lunch prices are some of the best !<->1
My first time trying Thai food and it was DELISHH ! ! ! I tried the Drunken Thai plate , the drunken noodles were to die for .<->1
Great atmosphere . Fun people all around . Beautiful and fun customers and staff . Margaritas are exquisite . They give a complimentary bucket of chips and salsa . The salsa is house made . The salsa has good flavor and spice .<->1
Food was great ! Clean quiet place . Started with wonton soup ... absolutely delicious ! ! Then shared orange chicken and shrimp pad thai with cold thai tea ! ! Everything was great ... will definitely come back .<->1
I got the twist custard ... SO DANG GOOD . My mom got the mango pineapple Italian ice . The workers were so nice and helpful ! Must go .<->1
Great place ! ! Friendly service . Managed well .. Food was great ! ! A must stop in Phoenix for breakfast<->1

Great job Lindsay ... Awesome service thanks for making our Friday night dinner da best ..<->1
Staff was very friendly and checked in frequently . We asked and got the free hummus from checking which was great . Ordered the falafel wrap which was fantastic ! ! Could n't be happier having stopped in . Will be returning soon for sure !<->1
Gluten - free / wheat - free French macaroon awesomeness .<->1
Everything is so delicious ! Favorite is Chicken Mole Enchiladas and the Carne Asada . Way better than Lindo Michoacan in my opinion . The horchata is never too sweet , it 's always just right , and the staff is amazing .<->1
Loved it . Crunchy batter fried chkn with pineapple . delicious lettuce wraps . Quaint and casual but nice , very clean . Went late lunch on a Sunday , just our table . Nice and quiet .<->1
fun little spot to take the kids for a treat . the staff is friendly and helpful . I loved the pistachio ! ! keep up the good work ! !<->1
We had a wonderful lunch here ! The waiter was great and he treated us like old friends ! Highly recommend the prime rib sliders and super salad !<->1
The girl with the blonde hir had a bad attitude food was so expinsive for 14 tqcos 31 dollars ! ! Bad service and expensive never again Thank You but no l .<->0
Best donuts I have had in a long time ! Apple Fritter was amazing it just needed a little more apple and the cronut was awesome . I just wish I lived a little closer . Great service as well .<->1
Outstanding . Better than place on Lake Cook . Yum ! Yum ! Yum ! Staff great . Best appetizers .<->1
I ordered something curry buy it was too watery so I ended up eating my friends dish Islamic noodles , their secret item not found in the menu . it was really good . Must try<->2
Great Buffet ! I love coming here . All the food is good and the Bloody Mary 's and Mimosas are included .<->1
Just okay . The el pastor tacos were a poor example of a great dish . No wait on a Thursday afternoon . But I would n't wait longer than 10 minutes<->2
Service here is fantastic and food was delicious . This was the first place I took my girlfriend on a date and now it 's traditional lol . We love it there !<->1
Outstanding food ! Excellent service ! I 'm glad we found this place . I 've been to many Indian restaurants . The owner personally came out to greet us and check on our experience .<->1
Best hookah ever ! They 're so friendly especially " temp " he is so nice and he knows to fix hookahs , what a wonderful hookah lounge ! I recommend you all to go there and try them .<->1
Great new cafe in the mallard church prosperity road area . Waffles are authentic and omelets are fluffy . Need to support the locals !<->1
Good portions , really good salad , kids meals have a lot of options , and the green smoothie I tried was good . Great alternative to salty , greasy fast food .<->1
Thanks Shannon M . for turning me onto this place . The meatball sandwich was fantastic . Loved the family owned and operated service .<->1
This place is awesome ! ! I have gone @ least a dozen times .. I bring out of town friends & family ... the food is always so fresh & tasty ... the staff is wonderful ... BTW their bread pudding is out of this world .. # imhooked onsavor<->1
Customer service is brutal , food is mediocre to bad , and the owner is just a horrible mean human being , treats customers like garbage . Avoid .<->0
Wonderful service . Very polite friendly and joyful employees . Delicious Ice cream ! Fun and entertaining to watch how they prepare your ice cream rolls .<->1
Delicious food and great service . The only negative we had is that it 's very noisy - more than a table of 4 and it would be hard to hear your friends . We will definitely go back !<->1
The service is a bit shaky out here but the same old kebabs from the downtown joint was more than compensation enough . The Koobideh is the best !<->2
Great food and service . My favorite is the Rachel 's chicken salad sandwich .<->1
Food quality is there .. Service / waitresses could be a little bit more happier about their job .. The garlicky , buttery , Hot n Juicy smell in your breath and fingers need to go ..<->0
The best place to come for breakfast ! ! Our favorite spot recommend it to anyone living in the green valley area<->1
The sushi was ok . Black rice was nothing to write home about , and it 's not fun to swat away gnats when you are trying to enjoy lunch .<->0
Food was very good . The service was fast and friendly . The price is on par with most Mexican restaurants . The restaurant was clean and pleasant .<->1
Love this place ! It gets a little busy sometimes on the weekends but the food is always awesome . Great tacos and chips and salsa are always good .<->1
Fresh baked bagels in house . Their Lox & Ranchero bagels are pretty delicious . The new management is making great improvements to the place .<->1
I was suggested to get the chipotle sandwich . The bread came out soggy due to their sauce . The portion was just right and a bit smaller than subway or to go . I was not too impressed with it .<->2
The food was super yuuummm . Great variety and big portions . Everyone was very friendly . The was a nice ambience . I would definitely recommend coming here . The only drawback is they close early on some days .<->1
Confort food at its best ! My wife introduced me to this delightful place . One of those hidden gems I hope stays open for a very long time . The breakfast sausage patties are so good ! ! !<->1
Four stars for the chicken tenders and sauces . Lower for everything else as the fries are too skinny and no other outstanding sides .<->1
Pad see ew on point their fried chicken / fried rice combo is Fuego clean store , nice staff , great food . Overall a pretty great Thai restaurant !<->1
4 stars overall ? Really ? Really really ? Fried chicken is soggy , syrup is mediocre , sides are meh . This place is gross . I 'd rather have Popeye 's .<->0
Always great service and great food . When friends and family come to town , I always take them there . The entertainment is always top notch .<->1
The food was good and he service was ok , was cool to go vist one of the oldest steak houses in vegas .<->2
This place is a hit or miss . Sometimes it 's really good and sometimes the meat is chewy and that throws the dish off . For a chain it 's pretty decent , definitely better than panda express .<->2
Delicious beers . Great service , pretty atmosphere . My only complaint are the appetizers are tiny . We ordered the fried cauliflower and pretzel . Cauliflower dish was super tiny .<->1
Real nothing special . Waiter mislead us on several items . Real quite disappointing . Ate in under 40 minutes and left<->0
THE best Mexican in Charlotte ! Authentic and fresh . Super delicious ! ! Be sure to try the fresh squeezed margarita and enchiladas with scratch - made red sauce . Amazing !<->1
Giagantic portions ... much too much food ... $ 50 for two sandwiches and a drink ... much too much money<->2
Great happy hour + good service = great place to get a Caprese Bloody Mary during happy hour and their food smelled awesome too<->1
Chicken wings are a good choice to soak up liquor quickly . Saturday night bar across from the restaurant have live music .<->2
Great little outdoor spot in AZ for coffee and conversation . I 've only visited once but loved the ambience and enjoyed being able to have a good coffee while my friend had wine . Great friendly staff too !<->1
Great little place . I stopped in for a beer and a quick snack . The service was good . A good selection of beers and some different food options - like the Cajun Pretzels . Very good .<->1
The food is delicious .. Great place run by great people . Lever and the staff offer excellent customer service to top it all off .<->1
The prices are insane . It 's absolutely criminal that they charge what they do for the dry , chewy food that clearly has been microwaved . It 's like eating leftovers you did n't enjoy the first time .<->0
Great food ! So gald they have a location in Mesa !<->1
Definitely not all it 's was made to be by watching the show shark tank . I was disappointed very bland . But great staff really friendly and clean establishment<->0
Nice atmosphere , courteous waitstaff , and most importantly , very tasty . Price was great , too : two dinners , two appetizers and a soda for under $ 60 . I 'd go back in a heartbeat .<->1
Amazing food reasonable prices and fabulous service ask for Karen ! Finally quality food that feels healthy and fresh !<->1
Been here 5 or so times now . My mothers side of the family is 100 % Italian . Food from Andreoli reminds me of family . And I love hearing other patrons enjoying their meals while speaking Italian . Recommend , recommend , recommend .<->1
Quality of pita bread is fresh and yummy . Great quality healthy food . Fast and fresh every time .<->1
Doughnuts were fresh and soft . Will definitely be back again ! I arrived around 1:30 pm in the afternoon on a Sunday and thought that they would n't have much to chose from around that time but they still had a good selection .<->1
This place is right downtown Montreal . Perfect downtown view ! Food and service were good !<->1
Summer Solstice Martini - 5 star + Flatbread appetizer w / avocado - 5 starWafèr fries w / dipping sauces - 5 starWater chestnut appetizer - 5 starAZ 88 service - 5 star ÷<->1
Love this place . Right in the heart of uptown . Delicious pastries , sandwiches and drinks . There are tons of places to sit and hangout . It 's decorated to the nines , gives such a cool vibe . You must go if you have n't already !<->1
So far I 've only had the Thai ice tea and it 's soooo good . I ca n't wait to try the appetizers and entrees .<->1
Really chill , buena vibra all the time I was there and just hands down have got probably the best tacos in the city !<->1
The staff was nice . The food was just warm temp . I would n't see myself going back just because the food was n't hot enough for me<->2
Great quality food and a nice , relaxed atmosphere .<->1
Some of the best Mexican food we 've had in the Valley . The enchiladas were pretty good , but the carne adovada was the the real star of the show -- OUTSTANDING . The tortillas were homemade , tender , and delicious .<->1
The food here is somewhat greasy and not that good . However , you come here not for the food but for the big screen TV 's . It 's not that great overall .<->0
Simply Amazing ! Have n't had pizza and cannoli this good since I was last in NY and Italy .<->1
Awesome service , great food , and fantastic mixed drinks . Who would have guessed pop - rocks would taste so delicious on a roll . Over all experience was outstanding and worth every $ $ $<->1
Love this hidden Vietnamese gem . The food is good and it hits the spot . I will definitely go back<->1
This is one of my favorite restaurants for breakfast and lunch . The got great food and fast service . The owner and staff always welcome you with a friendly attitude which is a big plus nowadays .<->1
Very enjoyable place for brunch . Everything about this place is really nice . The food , presentation , decor and service were all top notch .<->1
The food here is okay , not bad . Boba tea is average , I 've had much better in California :( . Their service is terrible , especially when you order take - out . The waiters / servers who give you your order is so rude !<->0
Good food . The service was fairly prompt and the dumplings were delicious !<->1
Our pizza was charred ( no pun intended ) . Aside from the burned crust , the flavors were good . We also had great salads . For what we got , it seems a little overpriced .<->2
cool food , and nice interior . if you want to taste Korean food I recommend this Gangnam Kitchen . Bibimbap is the best plate . and also Sushi is great too<->1
It was a great atmosphere and ambiance along with great food . The service was good and quick . A nice choice for Sewickley . I<->1
I LOVE their Chicken Fried Rice . Huge fan of anything else that I have gotten there . My favorite is the Orange Chicken . The staff there is extremely nice . I would really recommend this place .<->1
Delicious Pho , unsure why people are saying so salty . Wings were perfect . Price is right . Staff are nice . More of a dine and roll experience . I would go for a long date .<->1
Amazing Crepes Bretonnes , if you are seated at the bar , you will even see them cooking it for you .<->1
This place has really gone downhill . The tacos hardly have any meat in them and they were cold !<->0
Great place to eat when your in Cleveland . Expect 1hr wait most nights . Kids love picking out stir fry items and having them grilled up !<->1
Super endroit ! C'est beau , c'est calme , c'est grand . La choix de bière laisse parfois à désirer mais il est changeant . Bière en format dégustation seulement . Le buffet du midi , en semaine , vaut vraiment le détour !<->2
Not the greatest . Decent average food more comparable to a chain restaurant quality . Prices are higher then food is really worth .<->2
Great hidden gem ! Probably the best burger I 've had in the city ! Definitely try the chili cheese fries !<->1
A very cozy place . Excellent food :-) owner is very respectful and freindly . We orderes shish kabab and chicken with rice ... 5 star service<->1
I had breakfast here for the first time today and it was AMAZING . The potato breakfast burrito was perfection and their coffee was delish . Plus , the staff was super helpful ! I 'll definitely be going again !<->1
Great sushi . Service can be a little hit or miss though .<->1
been twice and both times were a home run . perfect gastropub menu with excellent service . the chef delivers in a big way and hey ... the clams with foie ? just order it and thank me later . you 're welcome ...<->1
I go to Pokè Bar at least once a week and it 's incredible . Lots of selection , always fresh , and inexpensive for the amount of food that you get . In the hot weather , it 's a great cold and healthy meal .<->1
We were pleasantly surprised to find this wonderful spot as it is located in the underwhelming Circuc Circus . The atmosphere and the food are second only to the service .<->1
Great menu with some great breakfast dishes . At times the service is lacking in details , but overall highly recommend .<->1
Awesome French dip , great southwestern egg rolls , the cheese burger was far better than the old owners . The new owners have made great improvements and are doing a great job . Best value in Belmont .<->1
Lots and lots of stick to your ribs , good food . You wo n't just leave , you will leave stuffed .<->1
Always the best spot for breakfast , lunch , and dinner when at the hotel . And right off the casino floor . Great service and selections . I highly recommend . Enjoy ! !<->1
I am vegetarian and this place is good for veggie guys too . They will make custom pizza as per your test . I like it .<->1
Food is fine just WAY overpriced . Felt like I got a child size portion . After my $ 13 omelette I left and had to go some where else to get the rest of my meal .<->0
Love this place especially for a Friday night ! Megan was so great all night and giving the best advice on the best wines they have ! Will be a regular here for sure ! !<->1
Really great atmosphere , fun place to do work with the free internet . Their burritos are excellent along with the coffee . A little pricey , but definitely worth it !<->1
I only eat their salad . They absolutely taste good , flavorful , with lots of ingredients , but are little pricey .<->1
Really enjoyed my dinner here . Great cheese plate . The creamed corn might have been my favorite side although all were delicious . The brisket was really nice , a tad salty . Wish I tried the desserts , I 'll definitely be back !<->1
Great food , great bar and great service ! The menu offers something for all pasty lovers !<->1
The breakfast here is phenomenal ! Huge portions so it 's nice to share . The owner is personable and a great chef ! We definitely will be coming back more often .<->1
I 've heard that coffee is not awesome in the south . And for this Miami girl that loves her cafecito , this place hits the spot . Thanks for existing !<->1
Excellent food and cool atmosphere I found the prices reasonable as well . I had the sabana de pollo and it was Awesome washed down with don Julio anejo<->1
Thought the food was absolutely delicious . The service is a little slow , but the food was awesome . Garlic Knots are great , I had classic lasagna and was great . Would recommend hands down .<->1
Typical in and out . The drivethru is always packed I suggest going inside ! Order is correct and they move quick . Always get your fries well done ! You wo n't regret it<->1
Everything is an up charge . Both times I 've been there has been good . They do tend to make your order incorrect . Will possibly try them again<->2
Had dinner with the wife - I got the Bacon Burger . It was almost as much as one might expect from a $ 20 hamburger . The service was uncharacteristically spotty .<->0
Ah , I hate to write this ... But they switched their calamari . What use to be awesome , perfectly seasoned calamari appetizer is now bland over breaded rings . I even returned my order . Boneheads , please switch it back ! Love , a calamari regular .<->2
Went here to celebrate my hubbys birthday . Eduardo was great . Service wonderful . Good excellent . Will be back for sure .<->1
Fast delivery . Food was delivered hot and fresh and everything tasted great . The delivery drive was also very kind .<->1
Awful service . We ordered brunch for 3 and waited for over 50 minutes before canceling . When we asked about our food , the cook yelled at us and told us to go to IHOP . I 'll never go back .<->0
Bartender Ashley is smokin hot . Great service even better ass . She put chicken in my dilla even though I said no chicken . It 's cool though . I recommend this place . Super chill .<->1
Service was awesome ! Had a margarita flatbread appetizer , which was amazing . Cheese packed Lasagna was delicious ! Best to have a reservation but appetizers and drinks are swerved in outside waiting area . Great restaurant overall .<->1
Breakfast was better than several other buffets and being a Hilton Diamond member with a $ 23 a Day food credit did n't hurt .<->1
Fantastic ! Best service and meal ever ! Chris and Gary served us and helped us pair the perfect wine with our steak ! Bravo Chris and Gary for making our experience an awesome one !<->1
It 's fast food Mexican , however it 's great for an inexpensive meal . There is a fair choice and Taco Tuesdays with $ 1.29 tacos is a great deal .<->1
Amazing authentic quesadillas and sopes . If you are looking for real mexican food . This is it ! ! Great taste and amazing service . I recommend the shredded beef , ground beef and potato with chorizo quesadillas and sopes .<->1
Dos Reales is amazing ! Pollo asado quesadilla is my go - to . You get so much food for a reasonable price . Margaritas are a must ! They usually have margarita specials as well .<->1
Great service . Good prices and portion sizes . The tamales and chicken tortilla soup are my favorite menu items .<->1
Horribly greasy food ! I was hoping this would be a fresher alternative spot according to their menu and I was very disappointed with the outcome . No good at all<->0
Dazzling example of near - authentic Italian . " Near - authentic " because the only thing that keeps it from being authentic is a 12 hour flight to Firenze . Slide on over to LivingSocial , get a coupon , and run to Va Bene .<->1
We love Brenda 's Kitchen . We frequent there for breakfast often . Their biscuits and gravy are amazing ! My husband loves their bacon burgers for lunch . Brenda and all her staff are very sweet .<->1
This is a great club if you have a table if not you end up getting run over by a bunch of drunk dudes . XS is way better and roomy<->2
I had a great experience here ! I had a Hispanic sushi chef ( do n't remember his name ) making my orders & he quickly made them . Everything was great . Will come again !<->1
EVP is awesome . Greg has been making me amazing Americano 's for years , and they are simply the best . Greg is an awesome barista who gets everything right . Love the beans , too .<->1
Worst food I 've eaten . California chicken tasted like it came straight from a microwave and the 10 oz steak was over cooked and did not have any taste . The baked potato was just as bad . Will not eat here again .<->0
What a cute place . Brought people from out of town and they loved it . Robert was such a great bartender . Very friendlyand knew what to suggest to eat and it was so good .<->1
Great place to eat I highly recommend it 's a little off strip but worth the drive cause of the large menu choices . Come and get it guys ! I 'm from California and this is like Denny 's times 10 .<->1
I normally do n't like coffee shops on the strip but I do like this one . The place looks clean and smells great . Staff is friendly . I 'll be revisiting it .<->1
This place is the real deal . Awesome portions and variety . I literally spent over an hour eating here because I had to savor each and every bite of the deliciousness<->1
This is a great place for take out lunch . Fast , fresh , great tasting food , and reasonably priced . Everything I 've had has been very good ... especially the cheese quesadilla !<->1
As compared to my experience of the Roadrunner on Pebble - this one was far worse - food quality and preparation was very poor , service was slow and inattentive , on a fairly slow weekend day nonetheless . Cannot recommend .<->0
I entered the empty ( 5 pm ) restaurant and ordered a blackened chicken burrito . I very much enjoyed the burrito and the hot ( habenero ) sauce I was able to pour over my burrito . Amazingly spicy but a delicious flavor !<->1
Our first visit to Haru Sushi was a success . Fresh sushi , professionally wrapped rolls , excellent service . Definitely going back !<->1
Excellent sushi ! Hospitality and atmosphere are right on .<->1
Halo Brewery is a small , local brewery on Wallace with nice beer . Better to stop by in the afternoon or early evening for the best experience .<->1
Great pho place . Great ambience . Spotty service but generally good . :) Highly recommended .<->1
Yummy ! So good ! Get the philly or the quesadilla or the po boy ! Chef Darnel cares about what he is serving , you ca n't go wrong with anything he serves . High quality food that you would n't expect from a good truck<->1
We went there for birthday treats . Gelato was good , but one of the specialty cupcakes was tasty but dry . Felt like it was stale . Cookies were good .<->1
The best margaritas we 've had in ages ! Would suggest this place to anyone !<->1
Serve reheated donuts as " fresh " when the hot now light is on . Not worth the cost when you get dry , old donuts .<->0
Me encanta , uno de mis restaurantes preferidos ! La comida y la atención del personal agradable , un lugar para compartir en familia !<->1
Not sure what is especial about this place with so many positive remarks . I was there once and I found everything very mediocre and nothing crazy .<->0
Avoid this . Phenomenally overpriced . The soup is tepid . The antipasto is boring . Nothing leaps out . What a disappointment .<->0
3.5 starsHowie Burger was good but nothing earth shattering . I had great service and the ambience is nice . Nothing over the top though or that I would say you must visit while you are in Phx .<->2
Small menu and obviously not the nicest casino but the food was inexpensive and really delicious and the restaurant itself is a cute place .<->1
Found this place close to our hotel . This was some pretty good sushi . Very quick service ! I would go again !<->1
Great bakery near the museum of fine arts . We stopped by before hiking up mont royal . Delicious croissant and Mille feuille ! It is now called Patisserie o Plaisirs Gourmandes .<->1
Love this restaurant ! Customer service is outstanding and food is very cheap and good ! My fave Mexican restaurant !<->1
Best ramen and great prices ... chicken karaage ? was yumm too and @ $ 4 each you are going to wanna get at least x2 . Did I mention ice cold Saporro cans ?<->1
One of the best breakfast places in town great bloody Mary 's and mimosas and the food you ca n't go wrong with the pancakes or the eggs Benedict<->1
Took my Satan wife too eat here because she says I never take her anywhere so I found this place on yelp and the Meatball sub Rebuked the demons straight back too hell .<->1
Cozy bar that my husband and I stumbled upon . Had the best of both worlds here , a tv with the Jay 's game on and amazing food .<->1
We traveled through Pittsburgh and stoped here for have some coffee . Very friendly people , great service , good coffee and amazing hot chocolate ! Thanks you so much !<->1
Amazing place . If you come to FH you have to go to this and get a bacon , egg , and cheese . Your life will forever change .<->1
Best grits I ever had ! Broccoli was fantastic . Steak was cooked perfect . WOW , ca n't say enough<->1
VERY GOOD chicken and waffles to die for , although very pricey and not kid friendly ... menu limited ... service very good ... but prepare to pay $ $ $<->1
Not only is the food outstanding , the work ethic in here is impeccable - the team work shows from the moment you step in the door - they are attentive and hands full always ! Fresh friendly and efficient !<->1
Prices are unbeatable & alcohol / liquor section was huge ! Wish there was a Woodman 's in my home town .<->1
Light and gourmet spin on Mexican food . The " Chicken Mole Verde " dish was to die for . Steal tip Enchilada was good and light<->1
Excellent cod . Great batter . Hush puppies are very good . Never going back to long john silvers . Even my 5 year old loved it .<->1
My mom loves the ginger chicken here . I love their other options like roast duck and roast pork . Most of places now they do n't make whole roast pork anymore but this place does so good point . Food 3.5 Service 3.5 Ambience 3<->1
Beers are all really good . Impressed with them . Recommend . We got a flight and not a single beer was " bad " .<->1
Amazing thin crust pizza coming from a very power coal brick oven . Great service and nice classic pizzeria feeling .<->1
Did they just change management ? Used to be 5 stars . Still the same good decor and service , but small portion lunch menu and favor of the tea drops like a rock .<->0
Excellent lemon drop excellent Ceviche app excellent salmon black beans and rice great food<->1
Never been to STK , but after my experience I am DEF a fan . The filet mignon was off amazing ! And yes it was a bit pricy , but not opposed to other fine dining restaurants in Las Vegas<->1
You got ta try Alfredo the Dark . A unique blend of Alfredo and poblano with fresh chopped tomatoes over cavatappi . Delicious ...<->1
Great food ... the tacos are very yummy , guacamole is very good too . Fun selection of margarita 's and friendly staff ! ! !<->1
Great food , quick service , nice ambience , good variety of pizza , soup , sandwiches and salad . The staff was very friendly and helpful . I recommend the " Italian " sandwich . I will definitely be a repeat customer .<->1
the place is so lit , the food is so lit , the service is so lit . Definitely one of the most lit restaurant in Toronto<->1
Came in for breakfast , blueberry pancakes delicious , service PERFECT with Ashley ! My son had a cheeseburger with the works style , said it was the best cheeseburger he 's had in awhile !<->1
Quick service . Good sauce . Nice selection of toppings . So much cheese I feel greasy . It 's okay .<->2
This place is really good especially for the value ! ! ! Milkshake is really good ! And the burgers are great too ... Would have to try out ! ! !<->1
Decent spot as there are n't any in New England but burger was bland and French fries were n't crispy . Small menu with only 3 burger options .<->2
Stopped by there on the way home this afternoon ... Ordered a Chicago style Black Angus Sirloin dawg . IT WAS GREAT . Looking forward to trying the rest of the menu !<->1
Delicious pumpkin pancakes and kind owner made for a great start to the day ! Clean and efficient .<->1
College spot ; the menu is not Taco Bell , so if your Spanish is limited ( like mine ) you better ask questions !<->1
Carne Asada burrito is the best ! Very friendly helpful staff . My wife and I eat here at least once a week .<->1
Bbq soy , with the rice and peas ... AMAZING . Often out of stew pumpkin and Mac n Cheese but food is always fresh and tasty . Staff is very friendly and helpful explaining all the dishes for the day .<->1
This place was fine . We went with the extended family , including three kids . Everyone found something on the menu to order but not everything was done as well as i expected . No standouts to recommend .<->2
This place was oddly empty at lunchtime . The prices are decent and the sushi rolls are fresh but the menu is pretty generic . Nothing spectacular ; just ' ok . '<->2
This hidden gem has found the perfect blend of updates classic steakhouse decor , an excellent menu and perfectly - prepared steaks . The prohibition drink menu is fantastic . A real find .<->1
Wow . One the best ribeye 's I have had in awhile . Good , attentive service by Lauren , but not to touchy feelly . Nice music . Overall positive visit and I would cheerfully come back for more .<->1
Food was good ! Service was excellent and fairly quick ! It 's pretty great for an airport restaurant , I recommend stopping by if you have a connection in CLT !<->1
Simply put . This place is awesome . No frills , just great sandwiches at a reasonable price . The staff is always super friendly too !<->1
Over priced $ $ $ Tasty soup ( Pho ) , friendly and helpful staff . Two ( 2 ) bowls of Pho and one ( 1 ) Iced Tea Bill came to $ 30.00 plus the tip ...<->2
Great food - at an airport ! ! Who knew this was possible ? I ordered the chopped turkey salad . It was delicious . Fresh ingredients and a tasty combination of flavors . Just what I needed .<->1
Disappointed .. probably the worst pizza crust I 've had in my life . Maybe it was an off night . MOD pizza is so much cheaper , quicker and better tasting ..<->0
While visiting here we ate out every night but came here 2 nights in a row , might be 3 Service was super friendly , treated us like regulars ! Thank you ! Food was awesome love the rib - eye tacos ! ! ! Pizza was authentic Italian !<->1
Sour and spicy bean with sliced meat is a real treat ! Frogs r also pretty tasty . Definitely coming back next time I am in Vegas .<->1
Great customer service when ever I carry out from this location ! Pizza tasted great and was to my order . Small but clean pick up area . Will be back !<->1
tend to take their sweet time filling prescriptions in the drive thru even when you are the only customer<->0
Sad , this place is known for its burgers and beer . They were out of all brown ales and most IPAs . Really ? Server was nice and pleasant , food good , but the F & B manager may need replacing . Stock your bar !<->2
Cool swanky build out that you would expect from this trendsetting restaurant team . Simple menu with a few options of tasty ramen - - the hand rolls are great too ! Specialty drinks did n't blow me away but good overall selection .<->1
Drive by this place mutiple times without stopping . Read some reviews on here and decided to give a try . Awesome food and atmosphere ! Will definitely be back !<->1
Always such a good experience eating here . The staff is super attentive and nice . Love the serve yourself wall of fresh foods so you can control your own portions .<->1
Cute joint with nice decor and really good breakfast . Everyone at our table ordered something different we all loved it !<->1
I 'm never eating at the stinkin ' hospital again . So good ! Super friendly . Great app so you do n't have wait for your falafel ( about 10 mins fresh ) . Seriously guys<->1
Excellent food . Had the fried plantains and the chicharron chicken . Hubby had the pork chops and rice and beans . Highly recommend .<->1
Great juices and salads<->1
This place is great but the wait is just awful . You pretty much have to eat with the senior citizens at 5 .<->1
I work at the nails salon in this beautiful plaza . I love their teas here , they also have delicious bakery 's ! I come here almost everyday !<->1
I really like teakwoods the food is good . It 's comfortable and they have the best Philly cheesesteak around now I 'm not from Philly but it sure taste good I do n't care where you 're from prices are n't bad either<->1
Consistently slow and aloof service . They also have a really awkward payment system if you decide to eat in and for a lunch place they close pretty early . Otherwise , the people there are nice and the food is not bad .<->2
Best locals hibachi place I ve been to in vegas . Great prices service and food .<->1
Staff was great and the bartender knew what he was doing . That being said , my room did have an unpleasant smell . And so did the next one smelled . I would nt stay here again .<->0
Ordered the French toast , chicken fried steak and the biscuits and gravy . They all came out pretty quickly and in large portions . We were famished when we came in and left completely stuffed . Believe the Yelp Hype . This place ROCKS ! ! !<->1
Best Coffee Shop in the downtown Toronto Financial District , hands down ! But it has been closed for unknown reasons without warning !<->1
Piano 's is good , but not my favorite . The people are very nice and the place is always busy . The ingredients are fresh , but I wish there was more browning on the crust .<->2
It 's called brick and barley now ... 2 stars for the service from the bartender . She just had a bad attitude and zero sense of urgency which comes off as lazy and uninterested in her job or customers .<->0
A nice place to grab a quick bite to eat . It 's in the middle of Kensington market . Clean , fast , and the chicken tacos are good . Oh and the have Coke in a bottle ! What more do you need ?<->1
The quality , taste of food , atmosphere and service are all great . I got the omakase and it was unreal . Only gave 4 stars bc it is super expensive here . It 's worth a trip for the experience .<->1
I go here for the bulk nuts ... almonds , cashews , and pecans in particular . Sometimes , they have irresistible prices on fruit and veggies . There is almost never a line at checkout . Parking is convenient .<->2
Excellent burgers and burritoes . Also has the advantage of being across the street from Medex , which has great medical marijuana . Great prices , too .<->1
Love it . Best seafood away from the ocean . The bread pudding desert is to die for but if you 're too full for desert take home a banana pudding .<->1
Do not order the hot dog . Not sure what it is made from but you wo n't like it . Chicken Florentine soup was good<->0
Place is really good ! ! ! I like everything the only thing that sucks is the line . Be ready to wait in line durning the busy times . Otherwise I link this place a lot .<->1
This place keeps getting better and better . It seems like they keep promoting the right people . I can call this place home . From the bar back to the management they all seem to cater to me . Love this place .<->1
Yum ! ! ! I always love katsuya and the Vegas location is just as good as the la spots . Dustin and Emily were our servers - really knowledgable and super friendly . Fun dinner !<->1
We ordered almost half their pizzas on the menu ( we came in with a pretty big group ) loved the pizzas - watch out for the Mexican pizza it 's spicy ! ! !<->1
Wow ! This was a completely unexpected treat . Genuine , homemade Mexican dishes . Delicious Margaritas . Great , personable service . I ca n't wait to go back for the carnitas street tacos and chile Colorado . Authentic . Reasonably priced for the real deal .<->1
This place is amazing not only do they have an indoor playground their paper bags and employee uniforms all resemble a burger . It 's the little things that count .<->1
FABULOUS FOOD ! OMG ! This food tastes like home cooking and it 's really good . We ordered one dish at first , but that ended up being 5 dishes ! AND 3 desserts between the 4 of us ! :)<->1
Love this place ... food is amazing and drinks are great too ... nice atmosphere ... patio is beautiful !<->1
The best . Grew up on Julios . My friends use this restaurant to get me out of my house when I do n't want to go out<->1
Best baklawa ever ! ! ! Service is ok , ( not terrible but not excellent either ) and not really a place to sit and eat . Have it to go and ENJOY ! ! ! I drive 20 km to get my fix .<->1
Best indian food I have had in USA , their pani puri at Sunday buffet is to die for ! ! Decor is very classy / hip ! ! Cool outdoor seating too ...<->1
Always grab a Cubano sandwich it 's tasty ! The pastries look yummy to !<->1
The owner has really high standards for his food . He does n't like people dining in the restaurant , only take - always . We love the meat platter , always very fresh and tasty .<->1
The meat lovers was good I would recommend this place for breakfast . Price are good big portions .<->1
First visit and it wo n't be our last . Friendly staff and great menu . The baked bree appetizer was soooo good . Looking forward to the warmer weather so we can try out the lovely patio .<->1
We had a great experience at Maya ! The people working there were very inviting and friendly . The ice cream was amazing and unique . I would go back again and recommend it to others .<->1
The place has new owners as of Nov 2016 and the food has gone down the toilet . Used to be super good , now its awful . Avoid this place now . Sorry to see such good food become uneatable !<->0
Bloody Mary bar is great for Sunday brunch . Food is bland<->0
Definitely the best smoothie bar in the PATH . Friendly and helpful staff . Lots of different fresh juice varieties , definitely have to come back and try them all !<->1
Good happy hour and great food , but I really wish they would have an easier way to split the will when you come in with a large group . Please just split the bills for us !<->2
Had a wonderful afternoon at Culinary Dropout ! Our Server William Wilson was amazing and delightful . Will be back very soon !<->1
3.5 stars . Great little lunch spot offering good Korean food at totally reasonable prices and the service is consistently very friendly .<->2
Best Thai food that I have found in Charlotte , and the Pad Thai is n't Red ! ! Only since moving down south have I seen red pad Thai ! ! Portions are small , but very tasty ! I will return !<->1
La Santisima is my fav ! Just be forewarned the service is really , really slow . But everyone is so nice and the food and drinks are incredible . I recommend the tampico marg and the salsa bar is delightful !<->1
The service @ the back in the open area was fantastic . But the girls inside the front had an attitude and acted like they were busy and they only had 5 customers in there . Disappointed . Wo n't try it again .<->0
Sweet and savory ! We ordered Nutella crepe and tomato with cheese . It was really good i just wish they diced the tomatoes rather than being big chunks .<->1
Nice Sunday evening dining experience . Walked in and was seated quickly on the outside patio ... place was busy . Food was ok , waiter was attentive ... nice location .<->1
I love this place ! Best hummus , best falafel and best soups ! Great staff , too .<->1
Came to this place for Saturday morning brunch . Cafeteria - style setup with lots small tables . Great food and excellent staff . Great brunch menu .<->1
Fantastic local shop ! I would highly recommend buying an assortment of their chocolates and laying them out as dessert at your next dinner party . Excellent service and an excellent product !<->1
Very good flavors in the food , not to spicy and it had a great authenticity to it . The drinks were killed and I loved the environment . Will be back every time I 'm in Charlotte !<->1
Love love love inta juice ! Been coming here for years ! The owners are great and always working so hard ! Never had a bad drink . So many smoothies to choose from ... so much better than Jamba juice !<->1
Very much over - priced place . They charge something like $ 15 for 4 shrimp dumplings . Shocked .<->0
Just yum . So so tasty and great service ! All staff were knowledgeable on what they were serving and were super attentive . A little pricey but done really well .<->1
First time to this new establishment ! I would say the ambience is great , great for all occasions but the food ok not great . The waitress we had was awesome ! Definitely would come back for the good service we had !<->2
This place is OK . The portions are tiny for the price and it 's more Americanized than the other restaurants in town .<->0
This is a great place to eat well and not have to pay a lot for your meal . Great food , great value !<->1
Amazing food , flavorful , and exactly what we were looking for . Fast and friendly service . I loved everything we ordered and I will definitely return or recommend to others .<->1
Ryan was really great . She helped us with recommendation and was really personable and friendly . The food was good and huge portions .<->1
If you have not experienced Global ... GO ! The food and service is impeccable ! ! ! Sooo good .<->1
Not only do they have creative flavors , but they also have FAYGO pop in bottles . Fun place to take my boys and enjoy a cone .<->1
The Taj Mahal is a fantastic restaurant , great tasting food , excellent quality and phenomenal service ! ! ! This is the best Indian restaurant I have experienced . Gill is a wonderful person and a fantastic owner . Bravo Gill Bob from New Jersey<->1
Awesome little dive for piping hot wings that are delicious . Great prices with just enough of a cozy atmosphere . Do n't change a thing guys .<->1
I believe our waitress was new or had just started but service was super slow and we did n't get checked in on once .<->0
Wow ! Happy my son and I dropped in for a quick bite to eat before an apt in downtown Phx . Great customer served at the area where breakfast is served .<->1
I 'm not a big fan of this place on the weekends ; too loud , too crowded , too much of a South Side vibe . However , on a quieter weekday , it ca n't be beat . Outstanding food , great beer list , friendly patrons and staff .<->1
GREAT salads and AWESOME customer service ! We get takeout salads once or twice a week . Everything is always FRESH ! It 's a go - to place for us .<->1
delivery dude " forgot " to bring change . how fucking convenient . Another $ 20 fucking dollars for a sandwich , drink and macaroni salad .<->0
Do n't order the pulled pork burger . Poor quality pork , fatty and with mysterious looking pieces of pork . The quality of the meal was poor . Meal was free after complaint .<->0
This is my 1st time here - definitely coming back - the food is amazing - you got ta try the fried green tomatoes ! ! !<->1
Actually not a bad place for crawfish ... The sauces were different from the other places but I liked the variation ...<->1
Not too bad of a wait if you get there on the later side . Delicious and MESSY . Be prepared to smell like your food for the rest of the night ( Especially if your bearded like myself ) .<->1
My hubby is burrito obsessed . Me not so much . Had the veg burrito one night . All ingredients were fresh and made to order . Friendly staff and nice decor . Enough said for a fast food place ...<->2
Huge grilled cheese sandwich 's with tons of options . The tomato soup tastes more like marinara sauce though which was a bummer .<->2
I love this place , they have n't disappointed me yet . The House Special breakfast burrito is the best I 've ever had . They 're also very friendly .<->1
This place is alright . The drinks were good and the people were nice but honestly nothing to write home about .<->2
Great , friendly service . Excellent flavorful Thai food . Especially love their gravies , curries and sauces . Fresh ingredients .<->1
this place is a nightmare ! they let people push ans shove and use their hands on the food it makes me sick even though I stopped going in Feb of last year !<->0
Super cool unique place in Vegas and Nick was great , excellent service . Will be coming back here soon<->1
Absolutely love this food ! ! It is my mission to try everything on the menu if I can get past the Tacos and Rolled Tacos first ! Staff is friendly and it 's is always clean !<->1
Came yesterday and they turned me away did not having egg whites . Today I showed up up at 7AM per signs do they said they do not serve until 7AM .<->0
Great food and warm service . Recommend the poutine and either the lobster or duck grilled cheese sammiches ...<->1
If you 're looking for a quiet patio this is the restaurant . With at least 60 % of their entire seating situated outdoors , you 're ensured an spot on the patio . The food was ok and the service was ok .<->2
Service was slow . Food was not tasty . It appears that they use spice to conceal food taste . Was my second time eating there and both were mediocre . There are better thai restaurants in the area .<->0
Mediocre food . Terrible customer service . So many great pizza places in Dormont and Beechview . Go to ANY other pizza place in the area .<->0
Must say how great and friendly the bar tenders are ! They take the time to explain what they offer and what they recommend ! I usually do n't do beer but they have a grapefruit beer which is amazing ! !<->1
Let 's just say after the visit we came back 4 times the same day ! It 's amazing , food is delicious , great quality and amazing service ! Their portions are big so it 's definitely filling . Owner is so humble .<->1
$ 45 for an Apple Pie ! ? What kind of apples are you using ? ? $ 8.00 tin deposit , $ 53.00 WOW !<->0
Slightly disappointing ... definitely a lower quality restaurant with average at best food .<->2
Stopped in on the way back from the Pinball Hall of fame for a quik beer and irish car bomb .. cool vibe , old school English pub . Keri our waitress was great . We 'll definetly stop in next time in town .<->1
Very good place food and customer service . Traditional Chinese food !<->1
I love this place , they have the best Sushi ! The restaurant is clean and the service is great . It 's our second time here and we will continue to come back .<->1
I was pleasantly surprised when my brother brought me to eat lunch here I had the vegetable delight combo Soooo Good this place should be packed what 's wrong with you Phx ? ? ? The service was excellent !<->1
I 'm honestly surprised this buffet only has 3 stars because everything was so good ! I 'm a picky eater and thought this place was great . I 've been to other buffets on the strip but they 're not as good as this one .<->1
I ordered chicken pot pie ( too salty ) . Everyone tells me the thing to order here is the meatloaf so I suppose I 'll give it a try next time . Overall good service and atmosphere . Will return soon .<->2
We had a group of 14 eat here on 5/12 / 17 . The food is amazing and our waitress did a great job . Highly recommend .<->1
So far so good , ca n't wait to try the rest of the menu . Green curry was amazing ! Great ambiance and friendly staff<->1
Great little breakfast place : good coffee and the pesto omelet was delicious . The patio was just perfect for a fall morning . We will definitely be back .<->1
Bathroom was nasty . Water did nt work to wash hands . Girl at the register shorted me on my food as well . Asked if I wanted spicy and still gave me mild . SMH<->0
Happy hour is great . Food typical bar food except for great salmon dinner . Very casual and relaxed setting . Service is good . Great cowboy bar experience .<->2
Food very good and Kumar and the waitress went above and beyond to make our experience wonderful . We will definitely be back .<->1
Their Galbi Tang ( Short Rib Soup ) is so damn good ! Their Galbi Jim ( Braised Short Rib ) is perfectly seasoned and soft / tender . The price is outstanding ... especially for Vegas . I 'd put this place up against any of my favorites in K - Town LA .<->1
Always excellent food and service . Attentive , knowledgeable staff and warm ambiance .<->1
Service and speed are much much better now . Really happy about that . Food is still excellent ! Ca n't get enough of the ceviche w green sauce !<->1
This is my favorite Greek place . I think it is family run . The food is fresh and delicious and staff is super friendly . Their Gyro and Greek salad are the best around !<->1
Firstly , the chips at the beginning were awesome . Service was pretty damn fast and the California roll & Shrimp tempura rolls were equally awesome . Definitely somewhere to try out .<->1
low key place , good for conversation with others<->2
Favorite sushi spot in Vegas . They 're super fast ! I 'm here every week . Sushi always tastes fresh & the service is great ! ALSO , I never have to wait for a table .<->1
Good food ; atmosphere was traditional Chinese . The Lo mein was amazing ! My husbands meal was late getting to the table but he was satisfied !<->1
Peking Duck and sushi were excellent ! Mussels , bbq pork , shrimp and pork dumplings and chocolate ice - cream are good ! The servers were also very polite .<->1
AWE . SUUUUMMMM.The Chile relleno stuffed breakfast burrito is one of the best burritos I 've ever had . Even their basic pancakes are incredible , fluffy and buttery sweet . Excellent service , beautiful presentation . Great casual atmosphere . A real gem in Henderson !<->1
Probably the best airport food you may have had . Service is typically good as well . Try the chop salad . Healthy and tasty .<->1
Our server , Krisztian was awesome ! Great meal and great service . He also brought out a birthday cake that said Happy 21st ! Flattery is key , will most definitely be back ! Thanks so much !<->1
Use to stop by for the cheaper gas , fell in love with soda fountain !<->1
Love the atmosphere of this RA . Great sushi and love the happy our saki bombs and sushi . Saki bombs always start off the night right .<->1
The food is great and the portion sizes are very generous . The staff is very friendly and the restaurant and bathroom are always clean .<->1
Burgers were good and the service was fine . For whatever reason it sort of reminded me of Outback Steakhouse -- only a Hawaiian version . The cheese fries are very similar .<->1
Excellent service and great food and live music . Authentic German Fare ... delicious . Each weekend a different special . It 's worth the drive .<->1
Great place to grab breakfast , the wait time is kinda long . freshly baked bread and clean kitchen ! that s what I 'm looking for when I go into an Asian restaurant .<->1
This place is perfect . Super casual and cute . The fondue was great and the selection in dippers was great . Came with my friend and it was a fun experience . Would be great for a cute date also .<->1
Went in on a Monday night about 10:30 ... no one there which is what we like . A lot of selection and it was delicious !<->1
The hummus and pita is the best in town I 've only had a couple of plates but have like everything I 've had Highly recommend .<->1
Phenomenal as usual , it 's not much different from the Lakewood location accept for the carasoul that moves very slowly as you eat your ice cream .<->1
Yummy nachos , margs and fajitas ! ! ! Yummmmmm ! I had the best server there , Richard ! ! I recommend this Nacho Daddy restaurant !<->1
Chris L was our server tonight . He was so accommodating , had the best customer service , and was so friendly . :) the food was great also ! ! We will be back<->1
Had a margarita pizza with spicy sausage . It was good and extremely reasonably priced at around nine dollars . Only takes 90 seconds to cook the pizza amazing , especially after a long day at work . Would definitely come here again .<->1

We tried Rio while visiting family in AZ and it was great mexican . The margarita was awesome and the service was good .<->1
Good service and location . Visit frequently . Wish that I could leave tips on my bank card . So often do not carry cash so feel bad when I ca n't leave a tip :(<->1

If you like cozy , hip , and good food you will really enjoy this place .<->1

Has been a great place to get my French fix ! Love their Pâté de Campagne avec cornichons on a fresh baguette ! Yummy ! ! ! Soups are great ! and of course their patisseries ! ! !<->1
Do not be fooled by the faux stucco on the outsdie . This is not a " nice " grocery store ; that being said , they sell liquor so sometimes it is a must stop . Seriously , Sapell 's . Mop the floors once in a while .<->0
Great drive up service , the gentleman actually counted back my change , with a smile . You just do n't get that in fast food any more .<->1
Perfect little cafe ! Great atmosphere , friendly staff . Small mom & pop place . Come on in !<->1
I ordered fish tacos for delivery - the fish tasted bad , like spoiled . Fish should not taste like this . My coworker ordered a calazone - was mediocre at best . Wo n't try here again !<->0
Casual and family run I think . The food has home cooking written all over it . It 's sure to impress . The jerk chicken has just the right kick . The oxtail roti is perfectly savory . Wow .<->1
Real Brick oven pizza just the same as in Italy . Friendly service , warm atmosphere . Salad for 2 is more than enough to share .<->1
Been here twice in the past 2 weeks ! Great flavors and good variety of toppings . The young adults working here are all super friendly and keep the place spotless ! ! Will go back often ! ! !<->1
Food is simply amazing ! ! Veggies were fresh and the entire dish was packed with flavor ! !<->1
Fight broke out but that s to be expected . Played Giant Jenga and Corn Hole ( or bags for you posers ) . Drinks were tasty and really enjoyed the inside . Love the patio as well .<->1
The French fries two ways and crispy brussel sprouts are amazing ! Good selection of beers on draft . Frankie was our bartender . He was friendly and did a fantastic job . Would definitely return .<->1
Sorry , you advertise fresh mozzarella you better be using fresh mozzarella . Nuff said<->0
Best burgers around and lots of choice . Get a Groupon . You will be stuffed ! There is also a good selection of beer and you can do a flight of any bottles they have .<->1
Bought 4 scones to go , lasted the trip home and were still deliciously crisp on the outside and tender inside . Amazing selection .<->1
We love this place ! The desserts are awesome . The onion soup and the quiche are my favorite .<->1
Karsen 's is a great laid back bar . Everyone ( staff and patrons ) is very friendly so it has the neighborhood pub vibe . Attention Scottsdale DBs ... please do not come here . You will not like it and the regulars do n't care .<->1
Wonderful food ... tastes just like mom makes . Absolutly delish . Fish fried to perfection , greens that make you want to slap yo momma ! ! !<->1
Great Vietnamese Food ! Glad to have found the menu on - line at http://www.urbanspoon.com/u/menu/263688?p=0 .<->1
Great service , fantastic coffee , an overall wonderful experience ! ! They also have a nice bookstore to browse in and pick up some excellent books ! The Grounds has an extensive menu , full of delicious coffees and teas !<->1
Le vrai gout du Mexique . Pas de chichis dans ce restau simple et très agréable !<->1
Great service , pizza & stuffed banana peppers . Shelley pie was also very affordable that is a recipe for success . I am now a customer for life .<->1
Came here late last night for some drinks . Sat outside . Servers were very friendly and did n't keep coming back to the table every 2 mins . Great vibe<->1
The cheese curds are awesome and the view of the capitol adds to the atmosphere . This is my favorite place to bring friends and family visiting Madison for the first time .<->1
So the owner is super nice and the bar has some really good craft beers available , but the food was n't that great . Really good service too , just wish that the food was better .<->0
I was twice here consecutive days . Amazing place with good food and amazing hot pepper sauce . Bought a bottle to take home .<->1
Just amazing food ! The chicken curry roti is my favourite . I drive down from Newmarket to pick up a delicious dinner .<->1
Love the crepe station . Huge beverage selection that my kids LOVE LOVE LOVE . Healthy organic good that 's fresh . We love this place and the food .<->1
Went here after hearing great things ... Left empty handed as apparently they do n't serve decaf coffee . Disappointing .<->0
Authentic taiwanese / chinese dishes and I always get good service . I recommend the salty spicy squid ( when they have it ) .<->1
So NOT come late at night ! ! They are slow and you will fall asleep waiting for your food<->0
Amazing place . I had the swordfish with pasta and fresh veggies . Delicious great service ! Although the check was a little late the waiter brough amaretto on the rocks to apologize !<->1
To busy and dirty and mobile ordering makes the wait even longer and customers have to wait workers tips drop<->0
They offer punch cards and it 's miles ahead of starbucks . Great local cofee shop<->1
This place is small , unassuming and in the middle of nowhere but the foods really good ! The sashimi was fresh , and the miso soup and rolls were delicious . It 's also very reasonably priced !<->1
I never want these cupcakes again . Cake was largely flavorless and a weird foamy texture . Frosting was equally weird and tasted more like chemicals than real ingredients . Overly sweet , one - note , pretty but they 're all show .<->0
Overall good dim sum . Nothing crazy or over the top , but definitely a solid place to get dim sum while you 're in Las Vegas and do n't have a car .<->1
Really good food ! Get a lot for your money . Amber was our waitress . Extremely sweet and helpful .<->1
I like the guys they r always nice and friendly , the donuts are always . Fresh always the best place for a midnight snack .<->1
I love sushi and have had it all over the country . This may be the best that I 've ever had . Absolutely awesome and completely reasonably priced for the quality . This is my new go - to spot .<->1
This coffee shop has many locations throughout Toronto . Great hours , great merchandise , cozy coffee shops and very helpful and courteous staff especially with online questions .<->1
Great service and even better food ! I 've been coming here at least once a week if not more ! The staff is super friendly and always remembers my friend and I .<->1
Good beer , Wednesday night is banjo night which always draws a crowd . Definitely a hipster bar . Food is fresh & worth trying . Get a dish that includes the house humus .<->2
Food is disappointing , service mediocre , portions small compare to all other Mediterranean restaurants in Vegas .<->0
Just had an amazing meal at Pho Kim Long ! ! Food was great and service was execellent !<->1
A little pricey but ice cream is worth it they also have pastries and candy . They also have the tallest chocolate fountain in the world ! Its inside the Bellagio right near the flower botanical area really nice .<->1
The best margarita in town . JERICKA IS the best bartender ever ! ! ! Ambiance is great as well ! ! We will definitely comeback ! ! !<->1
Tried this place because it was nearby . Food came out fast , service was good . However , the food was pretty average . Salsa did n't have much flavor and the fish tacos were bland .<->2
This place is a great bar to meet friends for happy hour and appetizers . It is huge and has TVs everywhere for sports .<->1
My wife and I went for appetizers and drinks on a Friday night . Service was poor , food had little to no taste and the drinks tasted watered down , I had a mule and my wife a bloody Mary . Very disappointed .<->0
Big fan ! I always get my morning coffee here . If going thru drive thru check your order for accuracy .<->1
Friendly staff , good flavors but the meet is dry and over cooked . I like that they use spices and not too much salt for flavor .<->2
Food was amazing , duh . But the service was impeccable . Ambiance = It Takes a Thief + Burnt<->1
Interesting that an expired passport is an acceptable form of i d for the federal government but not for blue martini ...<->0
Food and service was spot on . The music gets you pepped up and it 's a nice change of pace to the normal restaurant . Highly recommend the chicken biscuit for brunch !<->1
Worst ever sushi place in Las Vegas and I been to a lot of them . Will never come back to this place ever . Food and service sucks b ... ls .<->0
This place has been open for over two months , but it is a great place to sit down and have some great micro brews .<->1
I ate here a week ago and I just have to say Cheyenne and I think she said her name was Desee ? We 're both fabulous ! Super friendly and helpful ! I will be back for sure !<->1
Caroline , Al awesome in training and Manager Greg know how to give first class service ! Food and atmosphere was incredible ! Excellent choice ! It was a wonderful birthday celebration ! Keep up the great service !<->1
So far so good . Got the seafood roll and have to say , nom nom nom . Tasted awesome . Broc & Cheese soup tasted great .<->1
This Menchies almost never has cake batter flavor which is why we go to USwirl instead . Consider having it as a staple flavor .<->0
I love it here . Really good food and a great atmosphere . Food takes a while to come out but totally worth it . My personal favorite is the chicken Greek pasty , also their Apple Carmel pasty is delicious for desert .<->1
New favorite post - workout food ! Their strawberry , sweet potato and quinoa salad wrap is to die for ! !<->1
This place has returned to its former glory - please enjoy ! The Cambodian food is amazing . Dishes 82 - 98 are truly sublime , highly recommended .<->1
Excellent rolls ! Shared a combo that had spicy tuna , salmon and dynamite , all very good . Coming from Vancouver we know good sushi . Skip the all you can eat if you 're looking for quality in this area come here .<->1
Kind staff & tasty bagels . Would recommend it to anyone looking for authentic bagels & deli fare .<->1
Toujours très bon , service exceptionnel , bon rapport qualité prix ! Bon endroit pour un repas du dîner , pour planifier les desserts ou prendre un café avec un livre<->1
We went for an anniversary dinner and the staff and food made it especially memorable ! Maile took extra care and was on the ball with our every need ! I would definitely go back . The potatoes au gratin are to die for !<->1
My favorite place to shop ! I find myself shopping more here than at the regular grocery store . The frozen meals and fresh salads and wraps are so convenient and very tasty . Love this store !<->1
Amazing tasty lamb curries , decent price take out place ... I highly recommend the palak paneer .<->1
Been to multiple Brazilian steak houses and this is right up there with all of them . Once the meat came , it flowed pretty steadily . Our server , Amber , was great .<->1
Awesome servers , great padron peppers , sliders , fries , steaks and infused martinis !<->1
my favorite sushi place in phoenix . creative and fun . the lines can be a little much .<->1
Sugar lips have my favorite cupcakes in the valley ! I get cupcakes often , and the chocolate covered cherry , pink champagne , and salted caramel are my favorite ! ! !<->1
Was a great place ... key word is " was " . Market has been closed for several months now .<->0
We ordered some food for a production shoot and were pleasantly surprised . Everyone thought I did a great job picking out a spot , so thanks Panini Bread for making me look good .<->1
Love this place you have to come and try it out . We came in from out of town and found a wonderful surprise ! Hirosan was wonderful with us and the sushi was super fresh and so good !<->1
This is my new favorite place in the University area . They have so many options and choices . Will be visiting often .<->1
Beautiful restaurant ! The food was great and good service . I would recommend going at night the view is awesome ! !<->1
How can I not give this place five stars ? ? ! I love these burgers and fries ! The employees are always friendly and fast ! Two thumbs waaaay up !<->1
Sooooo good ! Just ordered from here through Uber Eats for the first time and I will definitely be ordering again !<->1
Awesome pizza ! The yoli Rollie 's are a must have , hand rolled with cheese and pepperoni . Authentic and fresh food . Plenty to share with each order . You must come to yolis if you 're in the Pittsburgh area .<->1
Amazing chicken salad and hummus . I love getting them to go to keep in the fridge as snacks .<->1
Great stuff in my neighborhood , but just a llittle heavy handed on the salt in the General Tsao 's chicken dish .<->1
Awesome place for the neighborhood . Always nice when you can get a coffee or a beer or wine . Great beer on tap . Friendly staff . Remodel they did looks great . Love the vibe .<->1
Service is always great ! The Dilly Bird and Wisconsin Cheese Soup are my regular favorites . I 've never had anything there that was n't good . My kids even like it . Portions are large .<->1
We have been here a few times . The food is always prepared very well and the service is always excellent . We always enjoy our time here . Never rushed .<->1
Amazing miso cod , sashimi sampler is overpriced at $ 120<->1
Good enough place to get comfort food . Nothing special but gets the job done .<->2
Really good pizza . Cool place , nice people , quick too and did n't break trip bank . I have zero issues and will return<->1
vraiment bien et service à la clientèle est chaleureux le problème il n'utilise pas d'interac . Il uniquement une ATM pour retirer l'argent . Mes amis que j'ai fais découvrir ce bar ont tous adoré .<->1
Hidden prices on " specials " Really small portions . Sushi was mediocre Really irritating radio blaring over the restaurant . Asked to change or turn down was told no . STAY AWAY ! ! !<->0
great staff , very attentive ! their mango avocado salad is fantastic ! i always get vegetable tempura as an appetizer ... their fry is fresh and light ! one of my favorite stops , for sure !<->1
Good solid burger , some creative plates . Limited menu , good value , convenient location . Amazing decor . Great fries !<->1
Delicious and affordable price ! We ordered beef noodle , deep fried chicken , pork . We thought food will be soso with this kind of price , BUT , we were wrong ! Food was delicious !<->1
This is the second time my family has eaten here ! It 's a GREAT hole in the wall restaurant ! The tacos were AMAZING ! ! My husband had the burrito and said the pork was incredible ! ! We 'll be back ! !<->1
The chocolates were so silky and very flavorful ! There were lots of flavors to pick from ! The chocolate Emergency Kit was perfect !<->1
Very average ... Hardly authentic , you think they would bring some complimentary natchos while you wait ...<->0
The best see food and great customer service .. cane all the way from LA ... love this place i recommend to everyone that comes to Las Vegas . ..<->1
Tell me first this place is vegetarian . And also est time to wait is 15 - 20 min . Ridiculous ! ! !<->0
Very good fresh sushi ! This place restored my faith in AZ sushi houses , the only thing that 's preventing me from giving them 5 stars is their rolls are n't bite sized . Will definitely become a regular here :)<->1
Brought hubby to doctor in the same strip mall and am glad that we stopped by . They have the best carne asada I ve ever had . Solid five stars .<->1
I was given a ridiculously small portion of pasta when I ordered from this place through Eat 24 . I would say to anyone thinking of ordering here find someplace else .<->0
? ? ?<->1
I 'm a Korean food junkie . This place sucks balls . NOTHING is authentic . We waited for food for 30 minutes . Everything is old and not fresh . Bad and slow service . Not worth going back here .<->0
Outstanding quality , fresh fish , generous portions , excellent value and best service both for dine in and take out .<->1
Wow . 445 at dinner time and no potatoes . Plus missing numerous missing items . Not even prepared for a dinner rush . It 's not even busy and out of things . Smh<->0
Best amaretti cookies in the city , hands down ! The family is always welcoming and friendly , the pastries are always fresh and the coffee is always good<->1
I 've been here a couple times now and while the atmosphere is nice , the food is very average .<->2
Everything was great ! Hot and sour soup was sooo flavorful . Carbs pops were light and creamy . The sushi rolls we had Vegas and hurricane were top notch ! And the prices for lunch make for a good deal !<->1
my favorite place of all time ! ! Fresh delicious food ! I also catered food from here too<->1
Nothing special at all . Much better options elsewhere .<->0

Ordered the Filetto Al Pepe Nero medium well and to my surprise it was n't butterflied & it was cooked to perfection . Best filet I have ever had ! The sauce was excellent ! The service was outstanding ! I highly recommend this restaurant .<->1
Large portions for a good price and tastes great . Quick with orders for takeout .<->1
Long lines are the norm . I walked out without purchasing more than I actually buy The new signs threes a crowd means nothing but if you like waiting in line this will be your favorite store<->0
I love shopping here , everyone is so nice and helpful , they have a great selection and the prices are very reasonable . I also like that they have extended hours .<->1
First and last check - in . Small portions , dry meat , expensive . Feels like I did n't even eat after the meal and it was for $ 10 . Now I 'm going to find another place to satisfy my hunger pains .<->0
I have eaten at over a hundred different indian resteraunts in 12 different states and 3 different countries . Curry bowl is the best i ve ever had . Will deffinatly be making return trips to this one .<->1

Good place for ramen in Markham . Tonkatsu Black ramen is the best choice on the menu .<->2

Went for lunch . The price menu a amazing deal . So good . The octopus is amazing . The lamb is killer . I 'd skip the hummus spreads .<->1
Had steak hoagie . Was ok nothing special . Service was ok . We also ordered pizza ... whoa big mistake .. 1 notch above cardboard .<->0
Though it is pricey Rabba usually makes up for it in other areas . They have ready made food ( sausage rolls , samosas , meat patties , sandwiches etc ) that is pretty tasty . Their hours are unbeatable , it 's 24 hours , even on Christmas .<->2
Went back tonight and wow it was so good ! Told us it would be ready in 7 - 10 min and it was out in 5 !<->1
Delicious Thai food ! Pad see ewe , crab fried rice , and Tom yum soup was really good ...<->1
This location is cool because they have internet and outlets and its not busy so I did my hw in peace and quiet ! And the girl with the glasses hooked it up with the value $ 1 fries yum !<->1
Cheap , questionable chicken and really , really overpriced considering the quality and amount that is given . Not a ton of options but the only thing open in town on Easter . Spend your money elsewhere .<->0
Had the Rickey Ricardo . Great take on a Cuban sandwich . Presentation and food 5 star for sure . Service a bit frenetic , but worth it for the chow . Great atmosphere , particularly for downtown vegas !<->1
Its too expensive here now . I m not coming here anymore . Hope they lower the smoothie price especially . Customer service has also gone down hill .<->0
This place has the best café con leche . My daughter and I enjoyed the delicious food as well . Super relaxing atmosphere !<->1
They messed up my online order in the begining but immediately sent me a new one correctly . Very nice people and delicious food !<->1
Sunday , Tuesday and Thursday they do half price wings . Pitchers are cheap too ! It 's cozy inside and fills up quickly . It ' s a favourite of mine .<->2
Ok for a place to drink a few but nothing special . Went with a friend . We had beers , chips and salsa , and wings . Again nothing special . Sat in the patio area outside , sorta narrow .<->2
Under new mgt as of May 2015 . Still reasonably - priced . Unassuming decor but better TVs , better seating / tables , evolving menu .<->1
My favorite pizza is Ny style . They nailed it ! So good ! I recommend the Don . And salad is amazing and so fresh !<->1
Had the BEST BRUNCH here this morning ! ! We sat outside and enjoyed the relaxing atmosphere . The florentine eggs Benedict was de - lish ! Would definitely recommend this as a GREAT spot to visit .<->1
Great customer service . Super cute little place with good Mediterranean food . Reminds me of being in the Mid East definitely want to try everything on the menu !<->1
I love to come for the Micheladas ! ! Spicy and delicious with whatever beer u prefer ! :)<->2
Great Broth ... This place is very busy . And i can tell why . Glad uts close to home . Will eat here again . But i wish there was more seating<->1
We enjoy this VI very much ! Service is always friendly and food is served hot and tastes great ! Our favorite Server Colleen is now a Hostess , so things can only get better !<->1
What a fun place ! Everything is marshmallow related . They even have a build your own s'more station ! So unique and so fun ! Major bonus : the employees were extremely friendly and helpful !<->1
The wings are cooked to perfection ! The employees are very friendly and patient . I 'm sorry I do n't frequent here often , but I sure in the heck will try !<->1
My absolute favorite Mexican restaurant ! The vegetarian fajitas are delicious and the queso is so addicting . It 's become my favorite comfort food ! The staff is also super sweet . Definitely visit !<->1
Love the location , love the atmosphere , loved eating at the bar where the guy to girl ratio was 4 - 1 . Defiantly aimed toward the younger crowd .<->1
Stopped by here while in Vegas on a business trip , was impressed ! Bibimbap was flavorful and all the bbq meats were fresh and well seasoned . Would recommend going during Happy Hours so you can grab some deals .<->1
Really 2 lines Friday night 10 plus people in line with 20 - 40 items each .. 2 lines come on . 99 cent store ... Get with it on customer care ... Bad customer awareness .<->0
Tasty food truck food marked up to nosebleed levels served in a huge soulless hangar by arrogant staff .<->0
Great steakhouse with affordable prices steaks comparable to high end steakhouses such as Flemings great wine list great to take a date<->1
Every Taco Tuesday with friends are the best ! Food is great and the service is always good and super fast<->1
We came to Vegas for 3days to watch the LA lakers vs Sacramento basketball game and we came here every day , that 's how much we like this place .. my nephew love their mango snow .<->1
I love everything about Kuben , from their fresh menu to everything that i love . I ca n't say more about it but order online bc they get busy . Try everything .<->1
Standard Taco Bell with standard long waits . the main problem with this location is the drive through speaker is insanely loud you will probably have to cover your ears while the person taking your order talks .<->2
A Pittsburgh tradition like no other . Unhealthy food served on wax paper ... Got ta have it twice a year !<->2
Great local place that I do n't go to enough . The food is really good and they have great specials almost everyday .<->1
Lovely haven in the financial district . Would n't have expected to find such friendly waiters and delicious food in the area ! The food was light but incredibly tasty , not the kind of place you leave feeling full and overwhelmed .<->1
A little overpriced but the bagels are always good and fresh . The cinnamon French toast ( made from their cinnamon log bread ) is also very good !<->1
Food and beer are always good here ! But service tonight is awful ! Been here 20 mins now and have n't even gotten a drink !<->0
I should have just eaten cardboard with sauce and cheese on it . Worst pizza ever . And does the lady at the till need to be so freakin angry ? ?<->0
Garbage . The meat is like old hamburger meat they try to Mask with sauces and Banana peppers . A sad imitation of a Philly Cheese steak . Go anywhere else with you hard earned nine bucks .<->0
Best steak house I 've ever been to . Period . Ridiculous quality steak for half the price you would expect ( starts at $ 20 ) . Great friendly service and the dining floor , which is located on the second floor , has a good atmosphere .<->1
Nice happy hour , friendly service , and good food . I recommend . Happy hour ribs are meaty , brisket quesadilla feeds two .<->1
C'est sale la nourriture n'est pas bonne . Les navet mariné ne sont pas bons les sauces ne goûte rien . Et pour couronner le tout on m'a fait réchauffer des patates dans le four micro - ondes ... lol<->0
Good food for a reasonable price and nice people . So glad my friend showed me this place . I 'll probably be here every week<->1
Horrible service .. servers were taking amongst themselves while we wait for them to notice . Food was not great quality . There had to be just 9 people here tonight on a Thursday at 8p m . Please pay attention to your customers .<->0
Huge portions , great service ! Decor is really outdated , but overall a good place to get a big breakfast on a Sunday morning !<->1
This 5 star review is solely for their new , delicious pineapple upside down cupcake . I am so glad that I tried this cupcake because I was impressed with the outcome . I will be back for another one !<->1
The quality of the seafood dishes are only ok but the oysters are pretty fresh . Service tho is kind of lacking . I 've been here a couple years before and it was much better then . Probably wo n't coke back<->2
The best meat shop in York region . I love their brisket and steak sandwich , so delicious<->1
I 'm tried your chocolate and vanilla flavor it was my first time eating it just me away<->1
This is not the restaurant the website or menu links to . This restaurant is in Coraopolis , where as the restaurant linked to is in Cannonsburgh .<->0
I usually try and steer clear of red meat but since I came to the original steak house in Phoenix , I do n't regret the filet at all ... very great place for a nice dinner<->1
Yum to the nachos , yum to the ahi tuna salad , and yum to the fish tacos . Service was perfect and quick and the place is so cute and quirky<->1
The pizza I had was so delicious ! The environment was fun and everything was really nice . I had the house pesto pizza and it could do with some extra pine nuts but otherwise no complaints !<->1
If you 're craving for meat , this is the place to go . The food is excellent and the service is great . Pretty original ordering concept , where you can mix & match your meat and sauces . Had a great meal !<->1
Nice restaurant with an interesting assortment of menu items . I recommend the poutine or the roast beef sandwich .<->1
Melt in your mouth crepes and dessert ! ! ! I will be a regular . I got the Nutella and almonds crepe ! Faint .<->1
Food was average . Server was fabulous . Order the clam chowder , have a pickle , a glass of wine and desert . Petit Filet was over cooked .<->2
Was looking to try the spicy ramen noodle challenge and found these gems ... # spicynoodlechallenge<->1
Best meat in town . I 'd rather buy steak here than go to any restaurant in town . Great staff , super helpful . I 'm very fortunate to be able to such a great butcher so close to me .<->1
Amazing service , view , and food . Hands down my favorite restaurant when visiting Pittsburgh .<->1
Great service , from the moment we walked in the door until we walked out ! ! ! Loved the fried okra . My husband ordered the ribs and loved them . The wings were also excellent !<->1
Best sliced pizza in Montreal ! I 've been on the hunt for 5 years , and this is IT<->1
The food is delicious and the setting perfect but the staff is super fake and condescending . With these prices and location , it would n't hurt getting them trained better and keeping them happy , so they can actually care about the customer .<->0
Fantastic food . Must try the Fried Hot - spicy Sweet pickle and the fried Jalipeano pepper with cream cheese . Burgers great !<->2
The food was quality , staff and their service fantastic & atmosphere was cool . The scallops were to die for ! The cavatelli was amazing ! Finally a great addition to our downtown scene !<->1
This was my first time there The burgers really are n't that special should have gotten the double but them fries tho . Wow they were great and it 's a nice atmosphere inside .<->1
Thank you Alex for my new favorite drink ! ! Y'all need to see what Alex can do and order the Green Tea Cocktail ! ! Best I ever had ! !<->1
Amazing food ! ! Cheap prices . Service was fabulous ! They could redesign their menu but that is the only thing I could possible say negative .<->1
Excellent food and great service ! I often come here for the burger , perfectly cooked . My friends in the office also frequent this establishment and enjoy it equally . Nice people , great food ! Keep up the good work !<->1
Pizza / bistro right around the corner from Notre Dame in Montreal , and it has a little outdoor deck on the street . The prices are reasonable , the food is not very good , we got pizzas and beer . It was ok .<->0
awesome late night patio and service . This is becoming my goto place for late night entertaining . I have come here handful of times , and each time was great . Love the bread and butter . Sitting on the patio is most enjoyable .<->1
The food was amazing as well as our server ! She was very knowledgeable on al the menu items ! It was a little bit louder then most location but you can definitely get over it . Will definitely come back !<->1
Was looking forward to my first visit cause i ve heard so much good about this place .. located right next to the strip , why would you close at 9 pm ? ? In - n - out and Chick - Fil - A right next door are open til midnight ...<->0
Great food . Menu can be a little confussing for us amateurs . Love the radishes and great setting . No worries , just ask those around you about their favorites .<->1
Ok beer selection , ok bar food ( though I am a bit of a beer / food snob ) . I do n't mind going when a group wants to go , but not my first choice if I 'm out on my own .<->2
Buen servicio y comida exquisita , buen ambiente un lugar maravilloso que nos hace recordar nuestra Bella Cuba , buena musica la pasamos maravillosamente mi Esposo y yo<->1
Poolside bar . Awesome view of the mountains and the Phoenix skyline . Moscow mules . Need I say more .<->1
Remodeled , great location , beautiful rooms , great view , loose slots , and decent eateries ..<->1
This place is better than pho Kim long . The service is impeccable . The food is excellent . This place is a MUST try ! ! !<->1
Beautiful , comfortable interior , delicious tea . A perfect place for a leisurely catch up with friends . Reminds me of Samovar in San Francisco and Andala in Cambridge , if you 've ever been to those . This place is a true gem of Pittsburgh .<->1
cool little place ... eat before it gets to hot as you sit outside .. they have misters but come on this is Phx and it gets hotter then he LL - had a great spring lunch in the sun today .<->1
Out with family in Las Vegas .. decided to skip a buffet tonight and came here . Food was tasty ... servers good . Very noisy because of superbowl .<->1
Attending a retirement seminar with Freedom Dream Team , Inc . Lets see what good info is provided along with this free meal .<->1
My wife and I love the food here in every meal that we have gotten over the years is great .<->1
Incredible food and very friendly staff . I order the lemon Grass Chicken and fell in luv with this new store . The staff was very accommodating and friendly<->1
Good place , good food , good people ... but I 'm from LA so Roscoe 's will always have my heart lol .<->1
DO NOT MISS THEIR tapas , especially the baba - ganoush . The chicken del sol was fully flavored without being too hot . Our server Karissa , was an absolute delight ... friendly , personable and knowledgeable . This Pita Jungle fits us to a tee .<->1
Brazos Burrito and Shiner Bock ! It does n't get much better than this in Phoenix if you 're from Texas . Chicken fried steak is amazing and the customer service rocks !<->1
Great spot . Friendly staff , great drinks , and reasonable prices . Definitely a must if you are in the LoSo area .<->1
Best sushi ! Just around the corner from our apartment and always a treat ! Only 4 stars because a bit pricey for us , but we splurge when we can ! Friendly staff and great food , what could be better ? ! Thanks ! !<->1
Nice open new restaurant / bar and welcome addition to downtown Euclid . Interesting menu , quick efficient service . Do not like the valet parking , reminds me of why I do n't go to Willoughby .<->1
Very authentic Mexican food . Do n't let the rundown hotel next to it fool you . Very good food .<->1
The honey walnut shrimp is awesome ! The same goes for the shrimp chow mein I am definitely going here from now on for my Chinese food fix .<->1
Stopped in here a few times , burgers are good bout it ... too many asshole Seattle & SF fans in here .. Quit coming in ..<->0
Awesome food . Filling portions . Def get the red velvet pancakes if u got a bit of a sweet tooth<->1
Love the food here . Sandwiches are good and HUGE .<->1
This McDonald is awful do not eat here , the worker was rude and did not take order down correctly .<->0
Love this place , alaways made to YOUR liking ! If you want more olives , you get more olives ! lol u do n't have to ask twice like other places !<->1
This was some good food . The wait staff was really on top of it . I got the chicken nachos and mahi mahi tacos . Defiantly going back to try more .<->1
Had good flavors but the yogurt just left a funny feeling in my mouth afterwards . The décor is cute but gets crowded . Layout is kind of different . I 'll stick with my favorite place U - Swirl<->2
Eating here now . All of us hate our food . Burger was completely raw . And been waiting for over 45 min<->0
This is another great local spot for lunch . I love their fresh / healthy approach to their meals . The portion size is large , but delicious . Also great covered patio seating and cute interior decoration .<->1
Hope I can give 0 , everything is really shit , worst service have ever seen , surcharge and force to tip , cash only , can not be any worse for this shitting place<->0
this place is the bomb . highly recommend it for dates .<->1
Cool atmosphere , subpar sushi . Rolls made sloppy . Sushi Kee is the spot when visiting M - Town<->0
If you want fabulous German food in Phoenix , this is the place to come . We love the schnitzel - - it 's huge -- and the apple strudel with vanilla sauce is the best I 've had . They have the cutest waitress in her dirndl too .<->1
Great selection of unique beers ! Prices less expensive or comparable to big box stores and you are supporting a local , Arcadia business !<->1
This is my fave Ethiopian resto . Affordable , authentic , delicious - and in a repurposed Italian restaurant , so you get to ask the servers about the mosaic boot on the floor . The servers are consistently lovely , as well .<->1
Why does it never smell like fresh bread in this place ? Is it not named " Panera Bread " ?<->0
This place is AWESOME I love the enviroment the great customer service and these bad ass innovative ideas for tasty healthy grubbin , this place is indeed GREAT GRUBBING<->1
Very busy but fast diner . Fun and friendly staff ! Great diner food ! Will be back for more . Highly recommended .<->1
Interesting waffle creations . Last time we had the thanksgiving waffle : infused with chicken and topped with marshmallows , great combo . Tip if you go with someone . Get one savory waffle , one sweet waffle , and share<->1
Great Service & Great Food + fun time playing poker on buzztime .<->1
Expensive and quality is not upto , there old location was good with great quality . Bdw there interior is great and retro .<->0
This place is what it is . A cheap greasy spoon dive with a cash only policy . If that sounds repulsive to you , do n't go ! If not , go and definitely have the French Toast . Service is ok at best but wth ?<->1
Great sushi . The menu has a lot of different choices to choose from with all you can eat . I definitely always recommend this place to my friends .<->1
Delicious jerk chicken . Coleslaw is great too . The owner Aneal is friendly and gives out cupcakes form his neighbor a bakery . The only place to go for Caribbean food north of Toronto .<->1
Clean , healthy , and nice . Love the quinoa salad , do n't knock it till you try it , sounds crazy but ... It 's delicious . Great place for a satisfying lunch .<->1
Love Starbucks this location 's outdoor area is pretty spacious and has coverings for the summer and heaters for the winter . Overall ca n't complain :)<->1
Hmmmmm , very delicious . Exceeded my expectations . Service was friendly , waitresses were always around to clear plates / take orders . Food was fun and inventive . Pricy but worth it . Definitely will be coming back . # ItIsWhatItIs<->1
Great theater . Popcorn is hot and good taste . Comfortable chairs but do n't get one that is at the top of the stairs you 'll be inconvenienced when people go up and down<->1
My card information was copied by someone in this restaurant and used in India . Later I heard several similar cases from friends and classmates . I do n't know exactly who did it , but be careful !<->0
Went there on a whim as a recommendation from one of my friends . Loved it . I will be going back . They have the Mexican coke bottles and the burritos are tasty . The carne Asada is great .<->1
I love this place . The prices are fair and the food is delicious . Brings me back to Japan .<->1
This is the best Chinese food in all of Toronto . I love the rice and noodles .<->1
Food came out raw and it took forever<->2
One of the most authentic Mexican restaurants in Calgary . Since coming home from California I have been looking for a place to compare to the Mexican food there . This place definitely does that !<->1
De la qualité à prix honnête . Portions généreuses ( combo végétarien ) et livraison rapide !<->1
This place is awful . I got a basic breakfast burrito and there was so much grease on it I could see through the flour tortilla . The filling was disgusting . Will not be back .<->0
Dude where 's the sign ? One star because I 'm pissed that the food is good but the place looks fucked up n kinda dirty inside n no sign . Wonder how the fridge looks ?<->0
Amazing , delicious , the best . I Go here all the time . Level Five spice if you can handle the black Hot Cheetos .<->1
Just had the " Uncle " Fat Tony pizza - fabulous ! Great sauce , great crust , super toppings ! Meant to have two slices , had four ! Hats off to " Sal "<->1
One of the worst pizza places I 've ever been to . If you want soup go to sweet tomatoes . Because that 's what this pizza is like . Truly a disappointment they should have stayed in Henderson where they belong .<->0
One of the best restaurants in Charlotte ! I had the Chilean Sea Bass , and it was great . Also , the Tres Leche cake is a must ! It was so light and wonderful .<->1
I am not a vegetarian and the bison burger is outstanding . Kale salad is very good as well .<->1
Small location , limited seating . Food is fine , it 's a McDonald 's what do you expect . Service is decent<->0
Great restaurant . Highly recommend the brisket and the Tavern Burger . Excellent food . Service was outstanding . Our meal was perfectly timed . A casual atmosphere with a degree of sophistication . Good kids menu as well . This restaurant is a great value .<->1
Excellent appearance of completely tasteless food . I went in pretty hungry and the large plate I got was really bland and the ingredients themselves appeared colorful , large and appetizing but Zero flavor !<->0
One of the worst meals ever , we should have known when the were out of three of the items we ordered . We will not be back !<->0
Great food and staff is very friendly . The bread is amazing and I always have to contain myself or I fill up on bread . One of the best middle tier steakhouses out there . Call ahead seating available and very convenient .<->1
Always consistent ... great meal .. great service . Hawkeye with protein pancakes is a winner .<->1
This is my first time doing a review because it 's worth it . This place is the best Japanese restaurant in Goodyear area . It 's cheap and yummy !<->1
Food was amazing .. Loved it .. The atmosphere was so lay back and the hospitality was great .. I would definitely come back .<->1
I ordered the special dumpling noddle soup and to be honest , it was n't all that special . It was pretty bland in my taste and overpriced ! But then again ... it IS vegas so you ca n't expect much . Overall experience is average .<->0
I feel that there is not enough variety for the amount of money you have to pay . Souper salad is cheaper and offer practically the same thing . Although they do serve fresher items then souper salad .<->0
Love love Tahoe springs . Been with them for five years . Love my delivery driver . And I found out customers can custom order water bottle labels ! I 'm in love ! Totally recommend this company .<->1
Easily one of the best if not the best Korean joint in Vegas . Place looks run down and terrible , and it is n't in the best area , but I would go there everyday for the seafood noodle soup<->1
I have never actually eaten Peruvian food from a restaurant . The chicken here was dry . It was flavorful tho . The beans were bland . Service was quick and friendly<->2
Had brunch here with a friend Sunday morning . The staff was friendly and my meal ( baked eggs with veal meat balls , tomato sauce and cheddar cheese ) was outstanding . Will definitely return in the near future for dinner .<->1
Excellent food , hot and still crispy when delivered ... Courteous and happy driver , Crab Rangoon were perfect . Everything had great flavor and was well executed . We will reorder :) Great job guys !<->1
Getting the DB Bistro Salad . Yum ! Had this salad once before . Much better than Cafe 56 , but you get what you pay for .<->1
Yummy , cool on A hot day , lovely friendly service from server . I had chocolate , salted caramel and vanilla with hot fudge . Our new after school treat .<->1
Best pizza in AZ ! Yes , even better then Bianco 's<->1
Been going here since I was a kid and I love love livr this place ! Best Mexican Food in the Valley and the service is pretty good .<->1
Excellent everything was great from the abvionce , food wine waiters definetly will be returning truly a fabulous experience .<->1
This place is the best . Being italian from NY , it is hard to find good Italian food . I am very pick ! The fried calamari is not rubbery ! Their bread is awesome ! If you do n't like Olive Garden , try this place ! ! !<->1
Probably the worst lobster roll I 've had in my life . And they gave me a total of 4 waffle fries .<->0
Just came for the fried Oreos and the chocolate peanut butter cake ! ! Amazing is the only thing that describes it ! Of course the after dinner drinks were also amazing ! Highly recommended ! !<->1
Awesome place ! Everyone is always helpful . Thanks Seth for your help<->1
I have only been here when it is really busy . I have been happy every time . The food is good and you ca n't beat their crazy selection . Great place .<->1
Exceeded my expectations . Fresh food . Everything comes right off the grill . Excellent customer service . Full bar . Live music and nice decor . Pleasantly surprised .<->1
Single girls - this is The place to be on a friday evening ! Ratio is definitely in your favor in a good way .<->1
Best Freakin sub in da burgh , I live in Cleveland but originally from McKeesport . Every time I come home I will have da Super Battleship hands down best sub I 've had thus far ! ! Steelers for life , down with the browns ! !<->1
Fresh and delicious sushi grade fish . Lots of fresh topping choices . Friendly staff . Will definitely be back !<->1
An ok restaurant but very very rude hostess . The food is nice ( biryani of course ) but the Punjabi Kadhi Pakora was horrible . Over priced menu .<->2
Chocolatine moelleuse et savoureuse ! Café filtre bon , juste pas assez dans mes goûts pour que je donne 5 * . Quand même une bonne option quand on est pressés , juste avant de prendre le métro à Mcgill !<->1
This place is the best . My go to is the Il Purista and the Tuna Pasta Salad , so good !<->1
We love this place . Every Friday ... PORK BELLY and Lobster bisque . No Matter WHAT ! !<->1
4.5 stars . Would recommend trying this place out ! Just shy of 5 stars only because our server could have been a little more attentive but was prompt overall . Portions are healthy sized .<->1
located all over toronto area .. kind of like a sports bar .. food was decent and does the job .. big portions and basically pub foodgood place to meet in a big group .. also went one nite to check out UFC<->2
I like this place a lot . I 'm a ramen guy and been to Japan 7 times . I 'm also full Japanese , it 's not your traditional style but I think it 's cool and taste great ! Plus it 's the only option near Henderson .<->1
My family and I went there on Saturday , our son loved the pancakes and I really enjoyed the corn beef cash . Not to mention the banana nut muffin was OUT of the world .<->1
If you like booze they got booze ... and they know a thing about wine . . . cuz they drink enough of it to know ! Dickie will feed your dog too many treats and they WILL get the shits .<->2
This review is for the taproom only . We did n't eat any food . Beer was excellent . Atmosphere was excellent . Bar tender was knowledgable , accessible , and friendly . Woohoo ! !<->1
What in the world just happened ? ! This waffle was hands down the best Belgian waffle I 've ever had . The staff was super friendly and I recommend this !<->1
Yum yum yum ! This place is a good find ! Good soups and sandwiches ! And a nice touch to add a chocolate dipped strawberry to the meal ! Love it !<->1
Was my first trip to JT 's and I will be back . Food and service was very good for lunch !<->1
Good mexican food . Enjoyed the tacos . The empanada was too oily but delicious !<->1
I 'm in foodie heaven here ! Perfect fish tacos , and that shrimp dip - to die for ! Atmosphere is great , service is friendly and excellent . Do try ! You wo n't be disappointed !<->1
A must try for every fried chicken lover . Generous portion , crunchy / tender delicious chicken , and an amazing sauce selection . Try the fry , " damn " hot , and spicy ranch sauces . Fries are crispy and salty scrumptious .<->1
Enjoyed the family diner experience . Our server was very attentive and nice . I had the house made Corned Beef Hash ! ! Yummy ! !<->1
The food is fantastic , for those of you who complain about slow service ; Have you ever been down south ? The servers here are so much quicker . You can also order ahead and pickup in the drive thru .<->1
Very delicious ramen and takoyaki . This place has a really cool interior design and a great metropolitan vibe . I recommend going on a Monday when they have their spicy shogun ramen special . Tasty food for a good price !<->1
Terrible service , the owner nickel and dimes you on everything . Even charges more for a " to go " cup .<->0
Horribly slow during lunch hour ! They need to train their employee 's to pick up the pace<->0
Crape was very good . I ve been there twice and I will keep going there for sure . Fruits was fresh and tasty . I love this place a lot<->1
Yummy chili cheese fries ! mmmm ! ! ! The original burger was good too . Nothing more to say though ... this location tastes as good as any other Johnny Rockets .<->1
Fast amazing subs , and great customer service . Finally a Jimmy Johns that is close to me ! ! !<->1
Of course it is a dump ... But the Ribs and the pice value is Out of this world ! ! ! The best place in town for Ribs .<->1
New York Vibe and that includes the attitude of the staff . Pizza is good but the employees come off irritated and rude .<->0
This restaurant was Amazing ! ! ! They have all day breakfast , Amazing food , and even a old country store , which is why it is called " Cracker Barrel Old country store " I would recommend for ANYBODY to come here<->1
In town on vacation . Great food and service . We had the chicken burrito and al pastor vampiros ! Delish . Loved it ! ! !<->1
Great craft beer selection and their peanut butter jelly burger is a must try ! ! Also enjoyed their pretzel sticks with beer cheese ! ! Service has always been friendly and accommodating ! 5 stars ! !<->1
All horrible Food a disaster . Menu reduced . Many good items eliminated . Love wolfgangs just not here<->0
Yep its a bar but you would not know it when you taste the food ! Order the turkey bacon club ( with bbq sauce on the side ) when it 's the special . Its amazing and I want it on the menu ! !<->1
Very authentic South Indian cuisine . Dosas are very good and the South Indian thali was also . The restaurant could use a little warmer ambience but the food makes up for it .<->1
I loved the Lobster Rolls and just the overall atmosphere of Sushiro , I would definitely recommend those wanting to try sushi for the first time to try Sushiro .<->1
Very friendly service . Although they messed up my order but we 're more than accommodating to fix it with a smile on their face<->1
The vibe here deceives its proximity to its yuppie surroundings . The coffee is good ( especially the mocha ) and there 's yummy baked goods on offer as well . If you prefer hipster charm over Starbucks variety , go here .<->1
Food is decent . Portions are small , but mediocre pricing at lunch hour . This restaurant definitely caters to the elders in Shadyside as opposed to the college crowd of CMU , Pitt and Chatham .<->2
Food is bland , portions are tiny and it is unacceptably expensive . Service was good though but the booths were very upright and uncomfortable . Not sure I would return . Joeys or BeerMarkt across the street are far better<->0
The hot dogs we ordered we 're sufficiently awesome and reasonable priced . Great craft beers and nice service .<->1
Service was very friendly and fast . I tried the very berry refresher drink and it was great ! We were in and out in less than two minutes . I would come here again anytime .<->1
This place is simply awesome great tacos and awesome service . I would eat here every day if i could . Definitely a must try<->1
Meh ... I 'm cajun and was thinking the crawfish would be boiled in crawfish boil . But instead , the spice came from an oil . The crawfish were tiny , however , they got the job done .<->0
Best bakery in town ! Love their donuts and cookies ! Also the best place to get a custom cake for a special occasion ! Wo n't disappoint !<->1
? ? ? ayce ? ? ? ayce ? ? ? 6 ? . _ . ? ? ?<->2
I really like this place . Excellent hummus and baba ghanoush . Very friendly folks . We come here often and recommend them highly<->1
Love it ! We always go there for fast drive through service ! Only 5 bucks ! Awesome ! Large pepperoni pizza<->2
Absolutely fantastic . Service was great , food was DELICIOUS , and the decor is perfect . I will 100 % be back here . Chicken tacos were awesome . Tip : ask for the jalapeño salsa .<->1
Food comes in large portions . I like the fact that they leave a coffee pitcher and at water pitcher on the table for quick refills . Service is good . Food is good Breakfast food .<->1
Love the concept . Love the taste . Love Love Love the price . Went in the first time and everything was so easy to follow . We did n't have to wait long at all , for fresh pizza . Very impressed .<->1
Really Yummy Ramen joint . They open at 11:30 and I highly recommend getting there 20 minutes early or you will wait in line . If you do n't mind the wait then you 'll be very happy with your decision .<->1
Great bagels and sandwiches ! Try the crumb cake and brownies too . They also sell flavored cream cheese . Yum .<->1
Great quality food and exceptional service ! Had the nem nuong spring rolls , bun rieu , and pho dac biet , and all were delicious ! Big portions !<->1
This place is super awesome ! The sushi is FANTASTIC ... especially the spicy crunchy tuna roll ! Their other cuisine is also yummy ... including the chicken lo mein , crab rangoon , edamame , and egg rolls . I m def a repeat customer ... good thing its within walking distance !<->1
In town for work and dropped in for dinner . The food was late and cold came out at different times . Not impressed with this location<->0
Chocolate covered strawberry ice cream is the best . Great place . Glad it 's in the neighborhood !<->1
Pretty terrible coffee . Other drinks are also less than spectacular . Cool ambiance though .<->0
a nice sub chain shop . Good value but bread could be better .<->2
Best fried rice ever ! The Oxtail fried rice was simply amazing ! Every bite of rice was filled with meat . Rarely happens with fried rice . Next time I go , definitely going to try the bone marrow pho . Looks crazy !<->1
How can a steakhouse not get a medium steak correct in three tries ? Once I was Ble to eat the food was very good but they need to fix the kitchen .<->2
Great from scratch food . We had the Italian Hoagir and the Lobster Roll . Both delicious ! Also loved the Pittsburgh bottled cola !<->1
Super super slow in the drive thru ! ! ! Took 20 mins with 4 cars in front of me . Ordered a flat white but there was no foam on top . Wo n't be coming back to this location .<->0
Ordered for pick up . The lasagna was surprisingly good , but the chicken Parm was a bit icky . It was just cheese on top of a not enough sauce , on top of chicken tenders , on top of a ton of spaghetti .<->1
I 've been to many buffets in Vegas and this has the best variety . Wine and beer is also included in the price . Best : Thai yellow curry with chicken , Ahi Poke , baked ziti , veggie tamales , chicken enchiladas , tator tots ...<->1
Pretty nice little gift shop . I bought a little elvis outfit for my godson and a shot glass . They had a very nice selection of merchandise along with decent customer service .<->1
Our server Charlie was great ! Soo informative about the menu and on top of everything . Great relaxing atmosphere and not ridiculously priced . Only problem is parking , like anywhere in old town . Definitely worth checking out !<->1
Been here a few times . Place is usually busy . The have a good variety of food for the buffet and quality is decent . I like the Kabob and Tandoori . Service is kinda lacking thought .<->1
I love this place everyone is so sweet and the food is to dye for ! The pizza and Del Mar are my favorites , oh wait ca n't forget the cannoli .<->1
Good pizza . Actually tried for first time because of special free delivery offer from Postmates . I liked the charred crust and the toppings were good . I also ordered a Cobb salad side and it was very good .<->1
Great place to have some breakfast ! Banana nut muffins are delicious and service is prompt , courteous and friendly . We had Oscar as our waiter and he was great to provide recommendations and was super friendly ! A must stop on our next trip back !<->1
Since the new owners have taken over the food is much better and it looks much cleaner . The food is very reasonably priced and tastes good . I will definitely be back .<->1
Done , gone , repossessed ! How you have a semi - crowded to crowded bar yet can not pay your bills I have to figure out .<->0
I 'm a Boulder City resident . Great food and great service . The sushi dishes were delicious . Very generous portions .<->1
This is now my favorite place to get coffee . Its so much cheaper and way better tasting than other coffee places .<->1
Loved it ! ! ! I had the egg rolls and fried rice , and they were AMAZING ! ! ! My friends got chicken pad thai and a beef dish ... any way ... does n't matter ... all very delicious ! ! !<->1
Great food and flavor and the bulgogi had an awesome taste . The staff was friendly and its great food with a great price . I recommend the bulgogi fries to everyone<->1
Girlfriend brought me here and fell in love with the place ! ! ! always been skeptical about ramen houses but not no more ! Ramen was great definitely coming back !<->1
We got a Joanna pizza to go . Pizza was good . One pizza fed two adults . They are about the size of maybe a medium . Atmosphere inside was nice . I will be back .<->1
Staff was super cool and nice . Staff was all knowledgeable and sweet . Highly recommend the Thrifty ice cream they have .<->1
Never opened the menu and had the chef 's choose our entire meal . Best meal we 've ever had , hands down . Thank you , Chef Rick Moonen and staff for a unforgettable experience from start to finish .<->1
Ordered a small pepperoni pizza and it was delicious ! The cheese was good , the sauce all the way to the crust ! Excited to try out other things from their menu ! We 've found our pizza place !<->1
Good food ! Nice service ! Easy access from the 101 from work . Try it you 'll like it .<->1
Great service and the crab cakes were excellent . I would recommend going and enjoy the views and the food .<->1
Best place to get Pho by far , but actually everything is really great . We go here at least 4 times a months<->1
Love this place . One of my favorites in town . Service is always wonderful and baked ziti is amazing everytime ! It can definitely get crowded and that 's a good thing !<->1
Overpriced , Chinese food . Got their chili chicken bento box and sweet and sour bento box . Shrimp tempura batter was thick and soggy . Food is not served hot . Will never eat there again .<->0
Food is just ok . Very overpriced and not really sure why since it 's Nevada and not California . There are better restaurants in Vegas in Chinatown .<->2
The authenticity of a German Brauhaus radiates throughout the restaurant . Great German beer selection with delectable German cuisine ; Maultaschen and Käsespätzle . Nothing too fancy , but great food and beer with a German vibe .<->1
What a gem . Gordon and Mary are super friendly and the breakfast was well prepared . Nothing fancy but very good .<->1
This place is delicious and you can get the breakfast burritos all day . They make it very easy to modify menu items for preferences .<->1
Italian beef had no taste at all , large sandwich was over priced ... Portillo 's in Buena Park by knotts berry farm was much more authentic , had a larger cheaper sandwich ... both are tourists trap 's<->0
Here again with friends . The food and spirits are very enjoyable . I 'm always going to remember this da . Our good friend Elvis is going away and we will miss him dearly .<->1
Very disappointing . The fact that you can mess up eggs , bacon , and sausage is very surprising . Everything was very bland . Wo n't be back .<->0
Good food in the heart of Downtown if you are in the area I suggest you stop by for a pint and some fish'n'chips .<->1
Love this place . My girlfriend introduced me and I 'm hooked . My only complaint is the smallish portions , but the food is spectacular !<->1
The service and food was so bad that we felt like we were on a hidden camera show . Unbelievably terrible .<->0
Really good grilled chicken salad with blueberry ginger vinaigrette . Service was great and people were very nice .<->1
So glad we found this place ! Food was on point and they were n't cheap on there alcohol . Highly recommend the Cadillac Margarita you wo n't be disappointed .<->1
Great place for a nice selection of local craft beer and international favorite 's must stop for beer enthusiast 's . Great freindly staff<->1
Staff here is amazing ! Free samples . Told us about the Yelp offer and the Groupon offer as well ! This is the place to go for chocolate in Las Vegas !<->1
price on the high side but I guess everything is expensive in Las Vegas .<->2
We had a great time here for a quick treat . The displays and ambience was superb . Coffee was a bit too strong for my liking . But would go again to try their homemade goodies<->1
Wow ! The only word I can say is : wow ! Never been to a McDonald like this before ! Staff .. they took orders really slow .. and they are RUDE !<->0
The best pizza I have ever eaten ! The service was excellent ! Being a vegas restaurant in a 5 star hotel the prices were also reasonable . Will be going back on my next trip to Vegas !<->1
Good food and nice staff . Must visit . Not a huge menu , but a good mix of all types of popular breakfast choices . Parking lot is a bit tricky . Coffee is excellent !<->1
We love Ritorno . Outstanding food every time . Great atmosphere and Julia is the most wonderful hostess in Oakville . Try the Gnocchi . Julia 's Nona still makes it by hand everyday .<->1
Carslbad knows know how to make a mean Carne Adovada plate . Atmosphere and staff are warm and comfortable . Wish the chips and salsa were free but they are worth the few bucks .<->1
After the stampede parade , we went in to grab a cool drink . Not only was the drink delicious , but the staff were amazing and helpful with my little boy . They went above and beyond !<->1
went here after a concert and was feeling hungry . the food here is ok . i loved their chocolate souffle ! but as far as the entries , i honestly was expecting more . it was just too mediocre for me . great atmosphere though .<->2
Great food and ambiance . My friend however was a little overwhelmed with the smell of fabuloso . Awesome cheese enchiladas and carnitas soft tacos . Chips and salsa always good .<->1
If you are looking for the best local Hunan restaurant in Vegas . This is your best choose . Best Hunan I have ever eat ! Fresh fish !<->1
First time there today got beef larb it was DELICIOUS will recommend and definitely coming back ! ! !<->1
$ 30 included a great hamburger , French fries , two beers and a nice tip . I will be back .<->2
Nice reasonably priced place for tasty gluten free options and even gluten free empanadas . Arepas are prepared very well and patacones are a good filling option . Order the beef or go vegetarian . Service was also quite nice .<->1
Thrilled to have good pizza and calzones in the local area . So far we have not been disappointed eating here .<->1
I 've been here twice and have only gotten wine and it was somewhat earlier in the day . The service is really good . The staff and owner are friendly and helpful . I ve never eaten here so ca nt comment on that .<->1
I LOVE this place ! Every trip I take to vegas I have to stop by here .. Its truly amazing ! Must try ! ! !<->1
Almost cried . Other locations can be okay , but the delivery I got from this one was horrible . It will be a while before I go to any location after the experience I had here .<->0
This place is great . We go here often , definitely my favorite breakfast place off strip in Las Vegas . Great service , great food . Ca n't ask for more .<->1
Good chicken . Horrible service . Drive through attendant was rude and obnoxious . And our order could n't have been more wrong . Will never return to this over hyped place with my family again .<->0
Had the sweet and spicy burger and it is the best burger I have had in arizona . Hands down . Everything else is okay but when one thing is so good ... you got ta go 5 stars<->1
My favorite chicken ! Crispy , crunchy , moist deliciousness . Always fast and friendly service , this beats " fast food " joints by far ! Add $ 1 pints to that and you have a winning combination for a casual lunch or dinner .<->1
Ramen are too salty . And I ordered takoyaki , soaked by ramen broth and It was n't supposed like that . Ayay ! But they have a very nice ambience place .<->0
Great food at a great price . The staff was incredible ! We were headed to lake mead and Hoover dam . Seen this on Yelp and gave it a try . We will go again if in area<->1
Splendid lunch - The Fajitas are really good . Definitely coming back to try other dish !<->1
Kobe beef meatballs , fish tacos , shrimp seafood raviolis and the best waitstaff = 5 stars . Thank you for an outstanding experience in Calgary .<->1
The service was great and we split a Jibarito ( which is a sandwich with fried plantain instead of bread ) and we had the beef version . It was so yummy ! Ca n't wait to go back and try the pork version !<->1
As someone else said , it always seems very empty when I visit the Ramen Bar , but I always enjoy the food . The wait staff is pleasant , and the portions are very large . Lots of options and it tastes delicious !<->1
Staffs are so polite and nice . I had the shio ramen with xo sauce . Not quite a good combination but the ramen itself is good .<->1
Ohhhhh the loaded spuds are the way to go . Poutine or Buff chicken so far . Go hungry<->1
Good food and service for a fair price . 2 large breakfast platters and coffee for less than $ 14 . They leave coffee thermos on the table so you never run out .<->1
The q rolls and donuts they bring at end of the meal are awesome ! ! We had the feast meal it was ok sides were ok as well . Not the best but ok .<->2
This place is gorgeous , love the place love the service , fun atmosphere . The prices are right The menu is healthy Recommended<->1
The BEST veggie burger I have ever had . Dottys is a must eat if you want a good American style restaurant ! Curds are also amazing ;-)<->1
Good food , good relaxed atmosphere . Have tried a couple of the sandwiches ( salmon , turkey club ) , nothing that memorable . Service was OK , despite being pretty crowded .<->2
I was going to stay home and rearrange my sock drawer but I decided to grab a beer and pizza at the echo . Made the right choice . The crust is thin and crispy and the beer is cold .<->1
Kind of gross -- wiping menus and tables with same rag , dry , no water or product . Syrup bottle top full of hair & lint stuck to it . First time here , probably the last .<->0
Back again oyster were super yummy Andrew was amazing wine was tasty and we got the special ca n't wait to try it love this place<->1
Frequent shopper and get my saving when I use my Fry 's card . Has a variety of good to chose from . From the pharmacy to produce . Nice workers and always feel welcomed .<->1
Owner was very rude . She added extra charge to the bill . Service wad bad , wish can give zero stars .<->0
This is the 3rd time I have eaten here in the last month the food and service are terrible . I keep thinking it was a bad day nope it 's gone down hill<->0
Delicious Mexican food with good family - friendly atmosphere .<->1
Love this spot ! ! I get the veggie burrito w egg whites and feta ... it 's the same crouse and everyone is super friendly . You might even see Pat , he 's an older gentleman that gives out scratcher tickets !<->1
Me Li and his food are awesome . His fake out is better than most dine in Chinese restaurants . Always reliable always good ! Keep it up<->1
Service here sucks . I love the food still . But the service is so bad , I never want to come back . Honestly . Sorry Zinc , ya'll need to get new servers or some shit . AWFUL service . AWFUL management .<->0
I love this place ! I like happy hours but tonight is even better ! Gets DJ mixing old and new school music ! The food is always good !<->1
This place is always packed . The food and service are always good . Large selection of beers on tap . Fun place to go with a group . Fish tacos are excellent !<->1
I 'm writing this review as I 'm getting the check . i LOVE this place not just for the quality of the fish .. the PEOPLE that work here .. amazing ! ! ! JJ , Tay vong .. are incredible ! ! ! Thanks for the amazing service ! ! !<->1
The rooms were really nice , but I have dust allergies and the room sent me into a sneezing fit . Otherwise , the staff was nice . The hotel restaurant was decent , however the waitress was a little hurried . Decent experience overall .<->2
Cute quaint place . Smells AMAZING . First time in , got an adorable HUGE cupcake for my daughter first birthday . It was more for the bright colors and smash effect :P .<->1
I agree with EVERYONE below . Hands down the BEST buffet in sin city . I tried SEA URCHIN for the first time here ... was n't exactly the best thing I put in my mouth ... but I tried it !<->1
This place has great food but the service is horrible ... 45 to an hour wait when there are open tables everywhere ... after ordering it took an hour to get my food ... I think the staff needs training<->0
Tried it for the five star review and the BBQ craving I was suffering and it was great ! Excellent food and great staff .<->1
Love this place great food the steak and kidney pie is amazing . Nice selection of beer great atmosphere and service .<->1
Saw this was on Diners , Dives , and Drives . I frequent Vegas quite a bit , so , had to make a stop here ! It was really good ! Will definitely make a return back !<->1
Absolutely love this place ! ! ! Better than origin , Mt Everest and Palace . Staff is awesome and decor is super nice and clean . My first choice for Indian food<->1
Worst coffee I ever had .. apparently owner left trainee by herself and it took 20 minutes for a coffee .. never coming back .<->0
This is some of the best Chinese food I 've ever eaten . They have the best chow mein . I tried the spicy generals chicken today it was fantastic . Quick service for lunch and good prices . Will recommend .<->1
Great food and drink options , friendly service and willingness to make my unconventional breakfast order ( turned out great ) . And a big plus ... they have ice cream too !<->1
I 've only had the Arizona bowl and crunch till , but they are both excellent . Service can be a little slow at lunch during the week , but other than they it 's a great place .<->1
Decent food , friendly service , they were weekend slammed when we arrived , but once we got our order in the food came very quickly . Noting really on the menu for vegetarians outside of breakfast though .<->1
This is a fantastic SAQ . They recently gave this location a serious upgrade . They doubled the size of the store . Let 's call it what it is ... A giant express SAQ . What more could anyone ask for .<->1
My favorite place close to campus . Generous specials , fresh fish and excellent creations . This is a great little spot for lunch or dinner .<->1
The food was ok , but for a filibertos it was not up to the usual quality . The place is a little dirty with dust every where on the ceilings and that is a turn off .<->2
Good service and food . For muslims : I recommend fries and sweet fries with earth burger . It marches the reputation and is not very pricy<->1
Really great staff and food is consistent . I fly southwest a lot so this is my normal stop for a quick bite to eat .<->1
I finally found a good soul food place Thanks to Angie and Mama I 'll definitely be back<->0
OH MY GOODNESS ! The buffalo chicken sandwich is the best sandwich I 've ever eaten ! Kenny is an amazing cook , and the staff here are so friendly . An awesome neighborhood eatery .<->1
Very good food for lunch or dinner . plenty of large selections and the staff are great .<->1
Delicious food - Meatball sub , supreme pizza , seafood ( clam ) linguine , and GARLIC KNOTTS are highly recommended . They deliver which is always a plus !<->1
My wife , two friends and I had dinner . I ordered the chicken mia . And it was delicious . The service was exceptional including the food server and hostess .<->1
This is one of my favorite places to eat . The food is always super good and the people who work here are always super friendly .<->1
I love their ramen . It is to die for . Also , their beef belly fried rice taste like heaven . Get their tonkatsu ramen with the flavored egg topping . Trust me .<->1
My family and I love Raising Canes . Get The Box Combo and Sweet tea mixed with Lemonade . BEST CHICKEN AND TEXAS TOAST EVER !<->1
Incredible beer selection . This is the only place in Toronto with good selection of sour beers I 've found so far . Make a reservation in advance , this place is always busy .<->1
Had sweet potato & greens breakfast bowl . It was delicious . Frank oversaw our table and was courteous and very helpful . Great experience !<->1
We go here all the time ! Shrimp with pad Thai noodle is our favorite . The miso soup is excellent .<->1
This was my first time and I thoroughly enjoyed my meal . Everything tasted so fresh and delicious . The service was wonderful . I 'll definitely be coming back .<->1
Love this place , great local hangout and good food<->1
Update : I 'm pleased to say the bar door is closed as the default . It really smells much better and I sat purposely close to the door just to see how good or bad it was .<->1
Amazing food and cocktails ! ! ! Everything is delicious , especially the Mac and cheese side and smokey Pablo cocktail ! Loved everything on the menu . Service was friendly too .<->1
Amazing service , amazing food , amazing atmosphere . Love it ! A must come ! ! Really love how they give you a palette cleanser between the appetizer and main courses , so thoughtful ! !<->1
I have ordered online a few time with there App . Every time I do my order is correct and ready when I pick up . Great job ! They also have outstanding customer service !<->1
Great breakfast always ! Get the old style has Brown 's , now dinner on Fri and Sat . Liquor and beer and wine ! !<->1
It 's 5 min away from home . Love it . My go to place when I get my cravings mmmmmmmmmmmm lol<->1
The worlds worst chipolte It 's fast food with attitude ! It 's more of a social scene between employees ! More into themselves than the customers ! Very quick and impersonal ! Feel like I 'm an unconvincing them ! Cold as ice !<->0
Recently enjoyed gelato in Rome . But MITCHELLS is the better ! Great cleveland experience ! Highly recommend to anyone visiting . And if you have kids ... they have a train to watch ! ! !<->1
Threatened to have the cops called on me for my grandpa making a joke . HORRIBLE food and even worse service . Waited over 45 minutes to get seated when there were plenty of tables open . Will NEVER go back ...<->0
I found the place by accident and is great , great portions , good customer service and the food is delicious specially the sandwiches , now I 'm a frequently customer .<->1
I could n't find an Italian in the place . The food is 100 % canned garbage . They serve there meatball sub on a hotdog bun . The customers are sheep . They would eat anything you feed them . Make sure you have your toilet paper very , very close ... YUCK ! ! !<->0
The best sushi place in Peoria ! Friendly staff & quality food . If your here Monday - Friday request Lauren . She is the best !<->1
I highly recommend the Buffalo Chips . Otherwise was n't a huge fan of the food , but in all fairness what I ordered was something our server said was not that good .<->2
Awesome weekend brunch , best bloody marys , wonderful staff & service . They have a really good happy hour during the week too . This is my " Cheers . "<->1
Awesome food and drinks ! Our waiter , Nathan made everything amazing for my birthday . We will be going back ! Also , the owner came around and asked how everything was , which was an extra special touch .<->1
Like the idea ... but just could nt be delivered ... fries were nt even good themselves ... found it really hard to eat them with the toppings when the fries had no taste<->0
If you 're looking for a classic diner , look no further . The food Is great and the prices are amazing . The staff are super friendly , which definitely enhances the family atmosphere .<->1
The food is ridiculously overpriced . $ 10 for a smoothie ? You have got to be kidding . It does have a nice ambience though and the food is decent , but way too greasy .<->2
Came here for Sunday brunch , I was impressed with their unique selections in the brunch buffet . Also unlimited mimosas for $ 10 so ca n't go wrong there . Our waitress was great too , she never let us run out of drinks !<->1
Came with a large group . Service was good . Food was yummy . My favorites are the guacamole and their margaritas !<->2
Found this place via Living Social last year . It was an Ok experience . We went back recently and discovered it 's closed now . Too bad . Cool concept . Return Factor - 0 %<->0
I recommend the bad dogs burger ! Awesome atmosphere and excellent service , this is a go to place !<->1
Great Service and Great Food - Easily the best Seafood place in the East Valley if not all of Phoenix !<->1
This place has a good rep , I just do n't like it . The pizza is way too oily or greasy however you want to call it . Not for me . I hate any food that 's covered in oil .<->0
I love love this place ... food and service is always great ! The trio pazoooookie " YUM " always hits the spot for a sweet craving ..<->1
Lovely service ; clean , fresh food ; perfect amount of choice in the menu ; a great way to eat a gourmet meal on the strip without feeling gross at the end or breaking the bank .<->1
I ordered two sandwiches , but only received one . The restaurant said they made it ; the delivery girl denied having it . Grubhub . Lame experience .<->0
Yummy Oxtail pho and lobster fried rice ! Hidden spot<->1
This place is amazing and you have to go , I got the apple dumpling sundae and it was incredible .<->1
Seriously , could eat this any day at any time of day . So bomb ! Never disappointed with the food or the service . Fast and delicious , ca n't be that !<->1
Great service , food was amazing ! Coming from San Diego we were delighted to see a familiar spot located in the heart of Vegas . It did not disappoint .<->1
The hot dogs are bomb ! & the staff is super friendly which makes the experience even better , they even gave us free chili fries ! ! ! But definitely try the elote fries , you wo n't regret it ! :)<->1
very good Indian restaurant . bring your own wine , love the butter chicken tally . Great nam bread !<->1
I 've been waiting for a place like this to open . This place needs fountain drinks and it would be perfect . Also need seaweed . Service was okay and fast . I just live across town and happened to be in the area .<->1
WOW love this place ! clean establishment , friendly staff , GREAT boba selection - kids loved it too !<->1
slighlty better than a firkin , o grady 's has an excellent patio that you can waste your nights with good friends and good beer.consistenly average and good and extra points for the nice location - good for people watching .<->2
A good bar needs very little description . Good drinks ! Good prices ! Attracts a fun crowd ! Nice outside patio ! All in all , a very good bar !<->1
Always a great choice for lunch or dinner ! Large portion sizes for really great value . The # 1 Pho option ( Satay beef ) is always a good bet !<->1
Best ice cream I ever had . Cute place ! I ca n't wait to go back before I leave Vegas . Yummmm<->1
what a great breakfast and server experience . fast helpful and always there for a top off of coffee and water . wild boar shoulder with eggs over easy on an open faced toast . fresh fruit on the side too .<->1
Our server Alexa definitely deserves a trip to Disneyland ! The food was amazing as always ! It usually is a bit of a wait but that 's because everything is so good !<->1
Pros : smoked salmon , braised beef ribs , dessertCons : king crab was lacking , prime rib was rubbery and did n't have much flavor , sushi was average and lacked selection<->2
Great pizza ! Could not get through by phone so had to drive to order . But very good pizza and salads . Worth it !<->1
Amazing ! The chefs are wonderful and the food is incredible ! Definitely coming back every time we come to Vegas !<->1
Love it sooooo good ! The chicken shawarma is amazing and the rice pudding is the best I 've ever had<->1
Over 40 minutes to get the worst , over salted , cat food gyro I 've ever had . Should have went to7 - 11 , they have better service and better tasting mystery meat .<->0
Grossly over - priced , as with anything on the strip . That said , the doughnuts were fresh and the service was extremely friendly .<->1
I have a family of nine - 7 adults and 2 kids - and we were advised we were not allowed to dine because our party was larger than 8 . Terrible !<->0
This was our first time and we really enjoyed our meals . The burgers were huge and the sweet potato fries were the best I 've ever had .<->1
Great variety of options . Homemade with lots of flavor . Friendly service . Family vibe .<->1
This place is AMAZING ! Food is super delicious , tasty , whatever you use to describe great vegan food . Give this place a try ! Like now !<->1
Loved everything about this place . Not only was the food amazing , but our waitress was fantastic . I ca n't wait to go back .<->1
Nice and quiet place . Many lunch special choices . Sushi and sashimi are really good .<->1
Randomly heard about it and brought in a bunch to the office . Absolutely delicious and filling .<->1
The sushi is good . The place seems busy everytime I come . The drinks could be stronger . Its a nice sushi place to eat at in Huntersville .<->1
Food was very good and they were accommodating with changes to the menu . The patio seating was fun because you can watch people go by . Try the smoked swordfish ... it was great<->1
Worst pancakes , you can taste egg in it , apple and dutch baby speciality are worst 2 things we ordered , highly unrecommended<->0
Really great authentic Phoenix dining ! Definitely a millennial joint : from the music to the convenience and even the staff , all around awesome experience . Staff was super helpful and nice , and the food was phenomenal ! Definitely a new favorite place !<->1
Great coffee and excellent service . The patio is s great work spot ( wi - fi ) on nice weather days . They have a pretty good lineup for local music on the weekends as well .<->1
The bisque is good . I ca n't say I 've ever had bad bisque . Drinks are Hella expensive but what do you expect at an airport restaurant ?<->2
Love the simple clean chicken schnitzel . Juicy and flavorful with a nice egg wash . Getting a baked good on the way about is always a good idea .<->1
I had my birthday yesterday and Alohdia , our server , made our experience here that much greater ! She was attentive and full of positive energy which is something not common especially when handling a party of 12 . Amazing experience ! !<->1
Sucks ! Everything was either too dense or mushy . Chicken feet did n't taste good . Ribs were chewy . Noodles were mushy and fell apart , Shumai was dense and chewy . Worst dim sum I 've ever had .<->0
Finally found a true Italian restaurant . The lasagna is amazing ! The deserts are just as delicious as the main course ! !<->1
The buffet is amazing . Great selection of my favorite dishes ; the flavor and quality of the food is off the chain . Great ambience , nice decor , reasonable prices and just an all - around great dining experience if you love Indian food .<->1
My favourite bakery and cafe ! The staff are amazing and take great care of their clients . The food is delicious and the treats are to die for !<->1
I like the milk chocolate ice cream it was very creamy and was n't very sweet . It also had great texture . However there are n't a lot flavours to choose from .<->1
I had lunch here and the chef let me know all the ingredients . The salmon was cooked amazingly well and the zucchini was green heartiness .<->1
Diabolical . Horrible excuse for food . No attention from bar staff . One and gone . It 's hard to elaborate wish I could find something nice to say apart from the place has lots of potential .<->0
The Happy Hour menu is very good , they changed it . We got 4 beers , a pizza and an appetizer for $ 25 . Definitely will be going back soon :)<->1
Just awesome ! Cute atmosphere and great service . Ginger bronie rocked ! Muffins were delicious . Will definitely go back again . Thank you !<->1
Excellent burgers ! $ 5 happy hour pitchers and specialty drinks as well ! Ceviche was really good as well ! Yum !<->1
Second time visiting this location and they have sold me for life . Amazing customer service and delicious food . The 99 cent margaritas on Monday do n't hurt either ;)<->1
Best sushi in town . That 's usually not saying much if you have ever had sushi outside of Az , but this place rivals my favorites in San Francisco and even holds well compared to my most recent Nobu visit .<->1
Thought we tried some fresh pasta so we tried Farina in Maple a hidden gem . The fresh ravioli were to only rav about and would go back . You can tell the take pride in making fresh pasta .<->1
Great lunch specials ! Monday $ 6 burger , 1 lb of wings , or chicken tenders . Burger was big , cooked to order , and juicy . Great atmosphere ! Service is good , friendly servers . They do have wifi available as well .<->1
Not happy with this location . We have been there 4 times and all times we have had issues , food , service and even other customers . The University location is 100 % better 5stars ! ! ! Hands down ! ! !<->0
Meh . its pretty cool but way over priced for Madison , WI Will run its course<->0
Overrated . That is really due to the fact that it 's located in Phoenix which has the best Mexican food this side of the border . It reminds me of Chipotle , which is not a good thing .<->2
Birthday dinner for my friend could n't beat the steak and lobster special .. Great service by Javier and great hospitality from Rem<->1
How could anyone say anything bad about these cakes ? ? ? SOOOOOOO delicious . So moist . So unbelievable . They ' re a bit pricey but absolutely - - 100 % - - worth every penny !<->1
This Thai restaurant is a good place for their fried rice and their Bangkok rolls . I sample their food during the taste of Charlotte and I have been going here ever since .<->1
Lovely brunch , tasty and healthy , reasonably priced , awesome staff , cute place with fresh - cut flowers ... what more do I need ? Nothing .<->1
Great food . Food is medicine and this is the cure . Highly recommend . Fit and tasty ! ! The staff is friendly and courteous .<->1
Love love this place ! ! ! Alex Guerrero is simply the best sever soooooo professional and patient . My steak was over cooked and fixed it right away no questions asked . Great customer service . Will be back in the future .<->1
Ritas never fails to deliver a great Mexican meal at good prices . Tried the chicken chimy really good as is all the other items I have had . Aaron is gr a at server bar tr nder<->1
The fish tasted like it was fresh from the ocean ! Thank you Ona , Maria , Jon and Sushi Chef Ken for an outstanding service experience . Highly suggest the sashimi combo platter .<->1
Far better than expected this far north . I 'm from So Cal and work a lot in Mexico . Tacos Adobados were some of the best tacos I 've had . Proper micheladas too . A pleasant surprise .<->1
One of my favorite places to eat some good barbeque . This place has been there for years . The staff is very nice and professional . Friday nights turn into a club and well you just ca n't go wrong ..<->1
It is a typical Brazilian Churrascaria , quite average in the meat variety . Cheese Rolls could be better as well . All in all a good place for meat lovers . Weekends are very crowded and the place is loud with live music .<->2
You will not get your money 's worth . Stale bagels , ran out of cream cheese . On a positive note , they have fresh fruit .<->0
All star cast at bar ! Personalize service from Travis and Kathy ! Always feel super special at the bar from those two ! Definite keepers !<->1
Fa - get it ! ! ! Grease pit ... for breakfast , lunch and dinner ! ! Sell that one too , maybe another greek restaurant owner will buy it ! !<->0
Not that great . Chain food . Cold fries . Twice . First and last visit . Each to their own<->0
Been coming here for years ! Awesome food and great atmosphere . A little bitter about them taking away the chocolate cake but I 'll live . Get the forbidden rice bowl or the pig dip !<->1
Good burger but not great or the best as advertised . Cheese and chili fries were above ave as well . Very good .<->1
This sushi has turned us into regulars ! Good food , awesome prices during happy hour ! !<->1
Good burgers place ( fast - food quality ) , they have alot of choices and very generous with their portions . I take this place over McDonald or Burger King anytime If you want to grab a fast lunch .<->1
The service was so great we used a groupon and our server kept updating us with how much we had left . The fried rice and lettuce wraps are super . Yummy<->1
Service was ok . Tacos were great but small . The first set of chips were rancid :(<->0
Friendly atmosphere , reasonable price . I had the Southwest spinach salad but with arugula . Very generous portion size and delicious flavor .<->1
This is my 3rd time coming to this location and they have screwed my order up all 3 times . They also charge me for ranch every time . No wonder this location is never busy .<->0
Ordered alot of things thru Doordash . Everything tasted great and was very fresh ! Order came earlier than expected as well , ca n't wait to try this place again soon !<->1
Yelp says this place is open . Drove here on a Tuesday at 3 pm and they are closed . Disappointed .<->0
What wonderful food and service ! ! Has the Baja fish tacos and they were super fresh ! ! Thanks James for all of your help ! ! ! Absolutely wonderful ! ! !<->1
Best place to eat chicken fingers ... Great services food is away freshI recommend to dine there after first visitYou will returned for more great fresh food<->1
Excellent food and service . This is a hidden gem for folks that enjoy really good enchiladas .<->1
Nothing special . Loud atmosphere , staff lacks experience in proper service . If your desperate to eat and are ok with average food , poor atmosphere and a staff that lacks experience then your good to go .<->2
FREE CORKAGE EVERY DAY OF THE WEEK ! A Great place if you like good pizza and great , down to earth people . It 's not fancy by any means , but pizza is and free corkage is definitely worth the drive .<->1
We went for restaurant week , and while everything was good and the gastronomy was impressive , I feel like the regular menu is a bit pricey .<->1
Came here late night and did n't feel welcomed at all as there was a group of people just staring us down maybe thought they were superior than us because they were friends with the workers oh well ..<->0
We absolutely LOVE Gina 's ! Always cooked to perfection and if you order a pepperoni pizza , you 're actually getting a pepperoni pizza ... they load them on there ! Their calzones are delicious too ! Toppings are loaded on these too . Do n't hesitate ... order now !<->1
My new favorite spot . Flavors are on point and the quality is great . I 'm addicted to the Tom Kha , especially in the winter . I highly recommend .<->1
Loved the Bulgarian eggs Benedict but not enough bread which they charge for . Otherwise their well edited menu is well executed .<->1
So good . Ca n't recommend this gem enough . Have taken so many folks here , and they 're all blown away by the freshness and cool concept .<->1
There are many good restaurant pop up brands . It was great . But price is high . It 's like expensive food court . It was good experience for me , but I 'd not go back . Maybe , next year ?<->2
I really enjoyed my cereal milk soft serve , the cornflakes were subtly salty and complimented the milky ice cream !<->1
Consistently good food . I really like the fried chicken . The restaurant is TINY so if there are diners waiting then you may wait for a while .<->1
Finally , we tried this nice , cozy restaurant . The Flat Iron Steak is super , and their Far Eastern Salad is also delicious . After dining , you can walk to the famous Water Park Plaza , Gilbert 's trademark ; o )<->1
Under new management great owners awesome staff friendly service ! ! Good things are going to happen ! ! ! Going to be a great hangout place ! ! Great specials awesome prices .. Open for breakfast lunch and dinner<->1
I ordered the VEGAN BBQ and it was phenomenal ! I 've also heard they have the best wings in town and will be in to try those shortly<->1
Wow . DANG TASTY ! Coconut shrimp , fish tacos , taco mountain , fish & chips and ahi poke salad . All four of us rated the food 5 stars . Excellent service ; clean and nice draft beer . Ca n't miss !<->1
First visit . Above average service . Great food . The fajita beef was exceptional . The chicken enchiladas were very good . Really loved the bean dip that was served with the chips and salsa . Will definitely return .<->1
The pizza is good . The people are very friendly . However , we are originally east coasters and prefer . Ledo ' s . Still looking .<->2
Very good experience here . Our waiter was very nice , and meal was delicious . My friend got the salmon and it was perfectly served , and my lobster pasta was great . Beautiful view of the Bellagio water display !<->1
Ribs , barbecue chicken flatbread , crab cakes , cast iron cookie . Best in town<->1
The vegetarian platter and lamb tibs were excellent ... I 've eaten at many etheopian establishments in DC and this is hands down the best I ever had .<->1
not bad but nothing exciting . guys behind the counter were really nice . very clean and restrooms were nice .<->1
Very solid . Condiments like raisins , nuts , etc are no charge . Not sure my palate is sensitive enough to differentiate between different japanese curry places so it 's hard to really rate . Cute waitresses though :)<->1
Food was okay . the inly thing captivating to me was the Pork Belly Bao , everything else was okay . Good service and the vube of the place us like a diner inside acadino . You do smell tne smoke from casino though .<->2
LOVE Rubios . Food here is always great and salsa is fresh !<->1
Fantastic gluten free options ! Fresh made breads , waffles , pancakes . The baked stuffed pancakes are amazing even though they are n't GF .<->1
Great service , great food . Why ca n't I get Thai food this good in Palm Springs ? Fresh , tasty and authentic ingredients .<->1
Besides the decoration of the restaurant , there 's nothing here that I appreciate . Orders were slow . Food are not good at all . Specifically their beef which is thick and tough , and they call it " premium " . I 'm kind of disappointed with it .<->0
Everytime I come here the wait is wayyy too long and we end up leaving . This place is overrated so stupid . I got " too drunk " and got kicked out . Now i m stuck on an indian reservation . Awesome .<->0
We had the tasting menu and everything was perfect ! Not very expensive at $ 80 / person . LOVED the chocolate cake at the end with the coconut ice cream ! ! Yum .<->1
$ 5 pizza Monday 's ! ! ! And since I checked into yelp I got a free drink ! And for a $ 1 more you can get thick crust ! I recommend getting one of the signature pizzas but you can always create your own !<->1
Had a scoop of the Vietnamese coffee and toasted coconut . What I loved about the ice cream was how powerful the flavor was . Both were delicious . Glad I do n't live close to this spot .<->1
Great service and food at the Biltmore Trie Foods ! ! Sooo good ! And love the " green tea " to go ! ! As well the wait staff always seems to remind me of my parking token which I really appreciate ! Thank you<->1
Amazing my favorite sub place in town . Always go for the turkey bacon ranch ! Friendly staff ! !<->1
They always have a pepperoni Hot & Ready ! Sometimes they are burnt though , so make sure you check out your pizza before you leave !<->1
Great turkey burger . Fun place . Good service . I would recommend when in town for sports games .<->1
Went here for a business dinner . Nice decor , lots of food options and ok service . I 'd recommend going for all you can eat because it gets pricey when you order from the al a carte menu .<->1
The best broth in Tempe ! Open early and the best hangover cure . So close to campus . The staff is incredibly nice and there are always customers in there at all times of the day .<->1
Just left there with a full tummy and a giant smile . Those native AZ ppl have no idea what a coney really is . This place is the best and is a must to experience !<->1
Had a great bacon cheeseburger earlier today . Not very pricey and very tasty .<->1
I have always found everything i was looking for in here . - 10 + for credit card - vegetables are not always of good quality<->1
Lunch buffet was AWESOME ! Ate way more than I needed to , but with so many things on the menu , I felt compelled to try them all ... Very good , and very clean .<->1
Great service and scholarly atmosphere . Hot tea , chocolate or coffee ... All great ! I get a lot of work done here .<->1
just went there today in search for some wings , and I 'm glad I did because they were so good ! Great service and the foo was amazing ! It tasted better than WingStop honestly ! The best part was they even had koolaid !<->1
Told me they was lamas here but there is just good food and drinks and tourists . No lamas . Not even fake ones .<->2
Wonderful ! Fresh food and a great staff . Small restaurant that 's very personable . What 's not to love ? ! Our first time eating here tonight and it will not be the last . We had oysters to start ... fantastic ! Everything was yummy .<->1
If you stop here , you got to top your noodles order with an order of the brussel sprouts . Ice & Fire is one of my favorite dishes in this awesome corner !<->1
The restaurant was great ! i loved the ambiance and the server that we had was fantastic ! ! I will definatly go back ! !<->1
Best gyros I ever had ... and I ve had a a lot ... and in many different countries . People are being critical of wait time ? ? ? Its a cook to order joint ... the wait time is normal .<->1
Better service than the one in the mall . Fast , friendly service . Same good stuff ... on a stick . Did I mention this location is NOT in a mall . Pepper jack on a stick is the best thing there , by the way .<->1
Nice portion sizes and prices . Everything is tasty and in a simple , casual atmosphere .<->2
$ 8.77 for a beer . Off the strip ! ! ! Ridiculous . This is a new place that touts a good happy hour . I call BS . Very limited food selection . And only PBR HH and those r $ 4.77 a piece . Never ever again .<->0
Longest wait I 've had at a McDonalds just to receive a simple order . Waited over 30 minutes for sausage mcmuffins and fries , then received the fries cold . Last time i stop here on a road trip .<->0
SO CUTE ! ! Great coffee , great breakfast burritos and great environment . There is a little outside sitting area and it 's very trendy . The bathroom is very fun as well<->1
They have very quick delivery service in Tempe . Whenever I order they knock on my door 15 minutes later . I love love love their Dodge City .<->1
Excellent food ! Love the fried " chicken , " and all of the barbecue sauces are very tasty ! I will definitely be returning !<->1
Great breakfast and service Bloody Mary mix ( Uncle Dougie spice ) with the works bacon and vegetables ! Best plan would be outside . Hostess could use some people training which is keeping from 5 star !<->1
decent food and service but minus a star for not taking credit card ... unacceptable in this day and age<->2
Great place for lunch , highly recomend it . Exellent service provided by Joey , who recommend the calabasitas ... delicious !<->1
Very unique dogs , gourmet , tasty and pricey . Quality food . It at the end of the day it 's a hotdog place and they do the best they can . Worth a visit every few months , closer to 3.5 than a true 4<->1
wayyyyyyyyyyyyyyyy overpriced for what you get ! ! ! well trained servers , but you 're much better off going to ruth 's chris .<->0
The service is supreme . And the food divine . The pumpkin bread is amazing and a delight .<->1
We eat here very I me we are in Scottsdale . Something yummy and healthy for everyone n the menu !<->1
Good atmosphere and really helpful employees . I am not an expert with Indian food , but I thought theirs was tasty . Especially for a counter service restaurant .<->1
Love the gelato and Enzo !<->1
Friendly service and quite affordable for being a hotel restaurant / bar . They do have a veggie burger option and the appetizers ( hummus , etc ) are tasty . Nice view of the capitol .<->1
Meal includes a trip to the excellent salad bar . Fried flounder , shrimp and scallops do n't disappoint . Orion rings are very good . Hush puppies are very good .<->1
Awesome food and great staff even got to meet the owner it 's a great place to have Sunday brunch<->1
The food was average and staff was not very friendly . The egg benedict bread was so hard that we could not cut it with a steak knife . Overall not worth the hype .<->0
We just love Brennan 's . They have the best produce in Madison and of course the samples are always great ! The more we sample , the more we buy here ! They have some of the best meat and cheese in town too .<->1
I bit on the pricey side , but what do you expect from Scottsdale . Food was excellent in every way .<->1
Sometimes the breads not fresh . Never enough meat . People not friendly . Now they raised prices so i m done with subway . Krazy sub was great as an option .<->0
Nothing spectacular . Ribs are okay . Side dishes are horrible . Onion rings are the best thing on the menu . Take out orders are more wrong than right .<->2
Great cocktails , with nods to historic AZ countrymen and women . The entrance is in the alley !<->1
Good American food.had the bbq chicken salad and coconut mojito ( yum ! ! ) which was on the lower calorie drink menu . The wait staff was attentive . I would go back to try other food on the menu .<->1
Had a bottle of wine with my wife before the theatre . The atmosphere was great and the staff was friendly . Did n't have any food though .<->1
This place has so many exotic flavors . Really good ice cream and other things are available !<->1
Service was OK . The food was n't so fresh . I can only try some of those since it starts smelling . But we got what we paid for after all .<->2
Was okay . Good burger and fries . Staff was friendly and helpful . Kid did n't like the egg on the burger . Overall pretty tasty .<->1
Horrible food , horrible service . I 'm really not sure how this place manages to stay in business .<->0
Ordered chicken Tikka masala extra spicy . What I got was really soupy and tasteless . Absolutely no spice whatsoever . I will never eat here again .<->0
Apparently I just ordered a cup of ice with boba . seriously ? still thirsty . most expensive cup of ice ever .<->0
THE BEST ONION RINGS EVER IN THE WORLD ! ! ! There 's no need to say anything more .<->1
Best Mexican coffee and delicious food . Wish they were open longer so I could enjoy an evening coffee . Workers always friendly and make good recommendations .<->1
Horrible pizza ! I was so disappointed with it . Even Dominos has better pizza than this crap . The 5 star Yelpers for this place must be related to the owner .<->0
I love this place . Great pizza , SUPER cheap , pretty quick , take credit and cash . Very awesome pizza<->1
Great food and great staff . Fresh food that will keep you warm in this cool weather . Owner is actively involved helping his team . This is a great addition to Davidson .<->1
As always . Great service . Fantastic food . Great weather for seating in the outside patio and having an early dinner as the sun sets . A definite favorite Scottsdale restaurant .<->1
The hookah place is great but the guy who works up there , Eddie , smokes chocolate hookah so i do nt trust him<->1
Reviewing breakfast . After everything you 're looking at almost $ 15 per person . Too much . Scrambles are mediocre . Sausage is gross . Coffee is n't hot enough . Waffles are dry . Worst breakfast value in town . Do n't bother .<->0
It 's a bar with Wayne 's name on it . Nice showcase and sports memorabilia . Food was good , skirts are too short . I will have my burgers elsewhere . My opinion .<->2
The pizza was disgusting & greasy was n't made fresh . The pizza was left out and reheated which upset my stomach.obvious they do n't care about there food Quality Please stay away from this place otherwise take a chance of getting sick !<->0
Amazingly delicious ! Try the California cheeseburger with grilled onions ! Yummy ! And the best fries ! Did n't really enjoy the chocolate shake , was a bit too lumpy & not enough chocolate flavour ... bu the rest of the meal was WOW !<->1
Amazing veggie burger and angus burger . Soft juicy and perefrct consistency . Veggie omlett was ok and can be avoided .<->1
Food is great and service is personable and awesome ! They have the best Unagi I have found in the east valley !<->1
Great service and the food is great . Marcus is the man ! The rest of the staff is very helpful . Definitely try the bang bang shrimp !<->1
This venue is so cool ! The food was tasty too ! Service was a little too slow for my liking but , still excited to go back !<->1
Love that there is a gas station on Lear Road . Not only is there gas , but the Get Go store is huge ! Big choices for coffee and beverages and hot food made as ordered . Awesome ! Awesome ! Awesome !<->1
I really enjoyed my meal at Bonsai . Staff was wonderful ! Quality ingredients , great sushi ! I will be back ... Often !<->1
They are the best chocolates ever ! The texture is delicate and very fine . Are perfectly well made and the taste and presentation are incomparable . I love them . I recommend it to everyone .<->1
Had lunch a wonderful grilled veggie salad everything very fresh . They had a beautiful display of cakes and pie . Would go again<->1
Had brunch here last weekend there was a weight but they took us to our table sooner than expected . The server was great the food was delicious especially the prices for how much food you get ! Will definitely be back !<->1
We had a great experience . The food was delicious and the staff were awesome . We had a few special requests and they were very accommodating , will definitely be back<->1
After my experience , the manager took the time to listen to me , addressing the issue in a very professional manner . Thank you .<->1
Great service ! Aleksandra was awesome ! Nice family dinner to celebrate my parents anniversary .<->1
Went for the first night of the sweet 16 . Was a struggle to get the games put on any TVs . Wings and fries were served at room temperature . Service was below average . Second time here , both experiences were poor .<->0
The food was great but our service was lack luster . I would expect a more attentive waiter at this price point .<->2
Great selection , good prices and comfortable seating ... BUT , the food quality was very poor ... its greasy and sits in your stomach . A few hours after eating , I started to feel very sick and nauseous . Would not recommend !<->0
Wow ... unbelievable food and incredible service ! Two things that are tough to find nowadays in Calgary . Juree 's is an absolute must try .<->1
Nice environment ! The people are very inviting . A wonderful alternative to the regular options available .<->1
look for the chicken tacos ! ! ! If they are out -- the burros enchilada style are the best in town -- been going there for years and never had a bad experience<->1
Everybody that works at Applebee 's friendly I like family the food is great I will go back<->1
LOVE this place ! ! ! Food is healthy and service is fast ! Definitely ca n't go wrong coming to this here ! Also , their house coffee is delicious !<->1
Love all the egg combos on their breakfast menu . Their scones and baked goods ... not a huge fan of ... but the coffee is delicious . Great ambience , and the staff are stellar .<->1
Decent food but awful customer service ! Someone messed up my pickup order and instead of helping me resolve the issue , they brushed me off . I will definitely not a return to this poorly run establishment<->0
My first Persian food experience in downtown Toronto . Excellent food and decent service . Amazing flat bread . I will definitely go back . Thanks for having us Sharon / Shaheen .<->1
Today , I had the tripe di Porto and the ham hocksWith black eyed peas and greens . Yum yum yum ! Nothing here is ever even close to being bad ! All is worth trying .<->1
Style bobo - hipster , deco vieillot et menu original ! Attention par contre , ils ne prennent pas interac ni crédit donc prévoir le tout ca $ h !<->1
Great location for a Starbucks and very nice inside . Staff is friendly . Drinks are def way more exp than Starbucks elsewhere . But what do you expect ? It 's vegas ..<->1
Absolutely far and away the BEST Mexican food in PA ! ! ! There is no need to get Mexican food somewhere else it will only be disappointing compared to Los Chiludos .<->1
Twice I 've been to Mesa Grill . Both times had steak and both times it was amazing . The old fashion I had was ok not the greatest but good bar tender . Worth the venture .<->1
We had the battered oysters , scallops , and swordfish steak . The food and drinks were great ! The only thing was the server forgetful and a bit snotty . Other than that , great dinner and atmosphere . Great for date night .<->1
WOW ! We had the NC Paella , sea level oysters and NC grits and shrimp . It was delicious , more than food it was a taste experience ! Service was fantastic ! Highly recommend .<->1
Loved the food . Especially the red curry . Will definitely come again for Thai food :)<->1
The best ! Warm and fluffy on the inside , crispy on the outside . It is very dense inside compared to the NYC carts . They are completely filled with cake 100 % . In NY it is half full .<->1
Well worth stopping here . Large portions reasonable price well prepared . Weekday was not crowded . Service was excellent .<->1
Taste like home . The coneys are awesome , then add a Faygo and some " Better made " chips , how can you go wrong .<->1
Great place great food great experience here with staff . i am from out of town just like back home and very clear place . will be back next time in town . thanks dickey 's<->1
All I will say it was multiple O 's in my mouth , one after another . Not cheap but worth every penny ! ! ! The only down thing is the seating area that it is a bit cramp , but very stylish ...<->1
Way overrated . Pizza was bad and had no tomato sauce despite assurances that it would . Nothing like artisan pizzas available in NYC .<->0
Terrific lunch menu with awesome burgers ! For $ 8 you ca n't get a better burger , fries and a drink any where else . Service is always friendly and it 's a great place to go with co workers !<->1
Love the Vietnamese Pork taco ( Banh Min ? )<->1
I come from California I wish this place had a second location in Los Angeles always come here when I come to Las Vegas best bqq I ever had .<->1
After ordering and eating an appetizer , the Subway commercial on the bar tv looked really tasty . Yuk . Do n't let your friends eat here !<->0
This place is great I love the vibe . My dads a taco caterer I know what good and authentic tacos look and taste like ; these are awesome . I recommend this place for sure !<->1
You ca n't get better than this store for every type of baking supply you need - and stuff you did n't know you needed until you saw it there .<->1
Excellent food selection and preparation . Delicious crab legs , perfect eggs Benedict and incredible Mexican food station ( best chicken tamales EVER and menudo ! ) , awesome desserts ... Sundays $ 20 . Champagne included .<->1
The food took about 10 minutes but was hot and made fresh . My only complaint would be that the poutine was drowned in gravy and resembled more of a soup .<->1
I was in love with this place . We ate here 3 times in our Vegas weekend and loved everything we tried . The bacon burger was my favorite . I will go back when I go back to Vegas .<->1
Video poker , topless dancers , 7 am to 7 pm happy hour , the DJ is amazing , best party location in Vegas ... enough said<->1
Hands down the most delicious Korean bbq your little tongues will ever taste . Stop reading reviews and go there now ! Now I said ! ! !<->1
The place is a perfect dump . Great little joint off the cluster f * * * known as Independence . It 's a time capsule that serves cold beer , burgers , dogs , etc .. Fast , friendly service , good digs , and did I mention cold beer ! Stay gold .<->1
Cold meatballs on the meatball sandwich - and no offer of doing something special or better . Typical Gastonia service .<->0
White tuna sushi was great ! But the Pad Thai just ok . Next time i 'll stick to the sushi<->2
La bouffe est toujours magnifique . La meilleure salade de papaye en ville . Les buns sont ultra cochons . Le staff toujours souriant . Les prix parfaits . Ils ont même une excellente IPA . Dans mon top 3 resto a YUL .<->1
Really good cupcakes and the custom cakes look amazing . The shop itself is s little too dark for my tastes but the cakes more than make up for it .<->1
Absolutely perfect in every respect . Yasmine and Russell were very competent as well as friendly and personable . The beef was superior and the sides were as well . Fine dining at it 's best .<->1
This place is fucking garbage bad service . Especially the bartending area , I found a cockroach in my burger .<->0
I just want to let everybody know that the best burger that I had in my life came from pizza 216 wow<->1
Had a welcome dinner here with drinks and heavy appetizers . Delish food ! ! ! Mini sliders were tasty , quesidillas were very very good , cinnamon donut was simple yet satisfying for your sweet tooth . Would definately recommend for American food .<->1
Stopped in for a Sunday lunch , decent place . Food is good and service staff are friendly . Simple but pleasant .<->1
This place never gets my order correct . Out of the handful of times I 've visited , I 've had to return at least 3 times for them to correct my order . Frustrating .<->0
Our first visit was memorable and enjoyable . Our server Debbie treated us with gusto ; the service was very speedy ; the food was delicious and affordable . We will return even the location is not on our flight path .<->1
Large menu . We all have different meals and even the kids liked their meals . I personally like it spicier , but that 's why they have hot sauce .<->1
Nice little restaurant . Sushi tasty and fresh and really enjoyed the sides included in the dinner . Nice flavours . Very friendly staff . Waitress and sushi chef both . Reasonable price . Would definitely come back .<->1
Everything is fine but they 're soup was horrible . Not sure if this is for this location only or all freshii . I would not order soup from freshii again .<->0
Nice surprise . Delicious fajitas . Great service . Nice ambience . Good value . Reservations accepted .<->1
Awesome service , great place for Sunday football . Michelle is the best ! Best part about this bar , is that it 's not smokey .<->1
Me and my best friend would come here like every week . This place is awesome . I personally love the green tea matcha<->1
Great , refreshing fruit smoothies . The perfect treat after a hike at south mountain park . Friendly staff , nice environment :)<->1
The worst Indian food ever . Sucks in quality , service and hygiene . Do n't waste your money , goto Mint India Bistro instead .<->0
Good place for get together with friends . Cozy environment . Me and my roommate ordered endless shrimp . We all prefer Garlic and Mediterranean flavors . Deep fried shrimp tastes similar , and not very recommended . Waitresses are very friendly .<->2
When we are in the Monroe Street area , we always stop here . Fresh ingredients fired in minutes . Family Friendly .<->1
How can a restaurant have 4 out of 5 employees in training at the same time ? Service extremely slow on this Sunday mo<->0
Great service . Very warm and welcoming . The food though is very over salted ! When you 're paying a very steep price , the food needs to be almost perfect . Over salting and over seasoning is an amateur move .<->2
This is my favorite place for Greek food . The food is amazing ! Always fresh and delicious ! The staff are friendly and welcoming . I would highly recommend eating at Yassou ! !<->1
Amazing nice staff ! ! 5:30- 6:30 free happy hour with good eats and beverages . The beds are super comfy and just a walk to the strip . Plus .. Really yummy Bloody 's at the poolside bar .<->1
A gem ! It 's clean , has beautiful decor , great ambiance , a large menu , excellent service . The best thing is that the food is delicious and is VERY reasonably priced ! We will be back again !<->1
Très bon rapport qualité / prix , service courtois , et plusieurs items plus créatifs que dans bien des restos à sushis .<->1
Always a good go to restaurant when you do n't know exactly what you want . Great beers on tap and good bar food , wings and some good entree selections .<->1
This place is grimy , and the chicken noodle soup should be called " uncooked onions in broth " soup .<->0
Best Coffee ever . Go there everyday . I prefer their mocha / cap to marche , second cup and starbucks . Oh did i mention they are cheaper than the rest ? Absolutely the best deal .<->1
Delicious and fresh French pastry ! Cashier legit speaks French and is very friendly :) Also , right beside it there is an awesome small family run restaurant ! Love this area !<->1
Wonderful food and wonderful people ! Best hash browns I 've had in a long time ! Absolutely love this place !<->1
Love this place . Good services , great food . It worths every penny . If you like Japanese food , this restaurant is a must - visit place .<->1
Between the fire display as you wait for a table and the elaborate tap system ; this place definitely screams " hip & cool " . I had the " hells kitchen burger " which was delicious . The chipotle ketchup is really good as well .<->1
Ordered from skip the dishes Got a naan burger and samosas The burger was actually AMAZING . Did n't expect it at all , it was big and filling with condiments on the side . I will 100 % order this again !<->1
Got down to my last chicken nugget and found what seems to be a hair . Kinda disappointed but it 's mcdonalds . What can you expect . Got to love Cleveland .<->0
They have the best Friday night fish fry . You have to go . I love the fact that you can choose from two different kinds of fish . The service is always friendly and the price is right you have to go<->1
Food is tasty , prices reasonable and restaurant is clean . Great for a quick and reasonably healthy meal .<->1
Exceptional menu , service and delightful to meet Carly ! She serves the community through her volunteerism , happy to support her business .<->1
Great sushi . Fairly priced . Music is hard to listen to but overall a good experience every time .<->1
Great food - - it 's a chain , so no surprises here - - but the drive thru line is always slow .<->2
Installation was done very fast and even helped with the dry wall . They made the process pretty simple and the guys that did the installation had a great personality . Used top of the line window very happy .<->1
The food was amazing . Great open atmosphere . Good prices and wonderful waitress . We went here before a Diamondbacks baseball game . Great find by my friend Marcy . We will be back !<->1
Rellay good food , great service . Grab a cookie on the way out ! Ca n't wait to go back again and explore the menu .<->1
My husband and I shared the chicken and red velvet waffles . They were delicious . A must to taste when you come here .<->1
The food is great here but the bartender is very attentive . Every time we have been in there , we have to wait for another drink , she is constantly at the other end of the bar on her phone .<->1
great pasta friendly staff , the desserts are great , we were a group of 20 people the waitress really made an effort .<->2
Great little cafe with a simple yet very good menu ! Great vibe , good cup of coffee and sweet people serving ! ! It will always be a stop when in Akron !<->1
Excellent atmosphere and great service ! Ask for Menz ! He 's on top of his tables and will give you an honest opinion on what to order ! Definitely try a smoking goblet , it 's a MUST !<->1
I like this bar , it 's quaint , great for intimate conversations with friends . Drinks are really good . Will definitely come back .<->1
Horrible rude service . Waited 20 minutes for drinks . Waitress made excuses and was n't apologetic at all . Never taking my kids here again .<->0
Cheap good ice cream . Only cash , so make sure you have cash on hand . Their dipped cones are delicious<->1
This place has really dry ribs . I would never go back . I 'm sure this location will be gone soon . It is supposed to be fall off the bone , these are hard to get off the bone<->0
This place was great ! We really enjoyed all the yakitori , takoyaki , and fried chicken . The service was friendly and enthusiastic . I hope this place does really well !<->1
Great atmosphere , great food , interesting fusion of Japanese flavours and North American breakfast - style foods . Portion sizes are smaller than your typical North American fare , but perfect for sharing or for smaller appetites .<->1
most devine sangria ! And their so * healthy * tapas are so delcious OMG i am getting my panties in a bunch just thinking of them !<->1
Just like every other Dutch Bros I have been to ... Amazing ! ! I love the people and the drinks ! Starbucks who ? ? ?<->1
Good pizza ! Nice , comfy atmosphere ! Prices are nt bad ! Good service ! ! Convenient location ! I like to make my own pizza ... Cream sauce , tomatoes , spinach , mushrooms and cheese ! MmmmmmM !<->1
Poppa Naps came to the rescue for our Mt . Charleston wedding ! Napoleon is fantastic . He was professional , accommodating , and of course he makes some amazing food !<->1
Good addition to the AZ Center more upscale and good food . Had the marg pizza and ceasar salad good stuff great lunch special for $ 9<->2
AZ boba tea places just do n't match up to more Asian - saturated regions , like the Bay Area . But this place is decent . Lots of good flavors , fast service , and recently added on pudding for extra ingredients .<->1
Horrible seating arrangements with really uncomfortable chairs . Too loud you ca n't even speak to those you 're with . There 's lots of open space in there it almost seems incomplete .<->0
Quite simply the best restaurant in Summerlin ! Best salad barBest meat qualityBest varietyAll you can eatBest service<->1
owner was very nice and let us taste a sample of almost everything . pistachio and salted caramel gelato is sooooo good . Not too sweet either . Def coming back . Very authentic crepe joint :)<->1
I 'm only reviewing the pork ramen . IT ' S AWESOME ! ! ! I should try something else , but ca n't move past the ramen . I lurves it so much . Fantastic flavor , yummy mushrooms and tons of noodles .<->1
Thanks Tanner you made a bad experience really good ! We appreciate your attentiveness to us despite our dissatisfaction .<->1
Thank you Pat for making my experience very enjoyable . Helped me find exactly what I needed and supplied multiple options without trying to sell me . Thank you for the knowledge and professional expertise . Recommend everyone<->1
Had it today for delivery , generous portions for the money and very fresh . I had the large size , huge portion .<->1
A bit pricey but great service . Great atmosphere . Great food . Eat in moderation ! :) Or else .<->1
Excellent pizza with unique garlic sauce . Wish they start halal options soon . Quality of pizza is always good . Also their cheesy garlic bread is too good<->1
Hands down best pizza we 've had in the area . If you like Sicilian style I highly recommend it !<->1
Amazing food , quaint atmosphere , had a special that was salmon , and veggies , it was delightful , they are very larg<->1
The menu is intriguing and the service is excellent ; too bad they could n't get the food to the table before it reached a tepid temperature .<->2
Cool concept . Its like a " Subway " or " Chipotle " for pizza or salads . The pizzas are only one size , fairly small . The salads could use more toppings . But all was good especially for the price<->1
Really good pizza . Just shy of being 5 stars . The service was great - people were very friendly . Place was clean .<->1
Nice upscale yet relaxed atmosphere . Food was EXCELLENT . The wagyu tacos , are small but pack a mighty punch . I was thoroughly impressed with the service & expertise provided by our waiter Jay . Oh ... the spare ribs ... DELISH !<->1
Un pub assez nouveau dans un quartier qui l'est encore plus , pratique pour les rencontres d'affaire ou rendez - vous avec de jeunes informaticiens ! Rien de très remarquable outre une grande terrasse et un service agréable et efficace .<->2
Went for happy hour on Friday night , not impressed . Ordered Bruscetti and we got 5 teeny pieces of bread with some balsamic vinegar and tomatoes on top , it was n't worth the $ 5 . Definately wo n't go back .<->0
It 's a small place with good quality , traditional food.owner is is a really humble person.we ordered chicken kabob , lamb shwerma , falafel . All dishes were tasty .<->1
Great pizza , authentic Italian cooking , do n't let the location turn you off , it 's a hidden gem !<->1
Pork belly BLT was outstanding , great beer selection . Wife had Tuna sushi salad was said , best ever . I very unexpected fine .<->1
This place is incredible ! Everything on the menu is delicious . I especially love the crispy brisket tacos and the fish taco . The churros are a MUST . I absolutely recommend stopping by this yummy taco spot next time you 're downtown<->1
Dimsum in the morning is hot and fresh . But when they using cart to push around . The food is cold and not fresh .<->0
Delicious Beef Burger in Town ! Yum ! It also provides a nice environment with comfortable seating , indoor and outdoor . Great selection of wines and a wide variety of dishes . Monday Special with Great Price ! Must Go & Eat ! !<->2
My new favorite poke place for sure ! Love that it 's family owned and that they keep the traditional Hawaiian flavors with the options of adding all kinds of extra toppings .<->1
Four stalls in the ladies ' room and two had out - of - order signs on them , one had a shower curtain in place of a door , and the one remaining in working order with a door had no t . p . at 8 : 00 pm .<->0
? ? 15 ? ? ?<->0
When I am home sick for Chicago food this is my go - to ! The Hot dogs and Beef are the best I have found in the valley . I would have given them 5 stars but they seem to have training issues .<->1
This place is great . They make what you ask and stamp your card . In and out .<->1
Worst service ever . Sat here for 10 min before even being acknowledged . Nice make server helped us , Victor . The women were cold and rude . Would n't recommend it unless he helps you .<->0
This place does not accept debit cards ? ? They have to catch up with the times , this is Not such chinese village in china , they are 100 years back in time , wo nt come here again ! !<->0
This restaurant is a beautiful restaurant tucked away in a plaza in Richmond Hill . Their dishes are very generic but the fish is very fresh . Overall food quality is there but nothing over the top amazing .<->1
Again used the service for delivery . What a complete disaster . Ca n't say much more ... placed food outside to be picked back up by the restaurant . $ 39 ? U judge<->0
Good thai tea ! Horrible food . Pad thai look like it was food colored and the noodle stick together . Salted fried chicken was too dry . Would not recommend .<->0
The drive - thru is efficient & I have yet to dine inside . I ordered the blueberry muffin top & cinnamon roll bc I have a sweet tooth . Next time I 'll definitely try something on the lunch menu .<->1
Unless you 're a snobby douche looking to throw away money on sub par seafood , do n't waste your time or money here . The ceviche contained neither ceviche nor ceviche . Wait staff just as snobby as the customers . Never again .<->0
The food was outstanding . Great place to go for Vegan food . So many options on the menu . Every dish we ordered was so delicious . Very nice ambiance and decor .<->1
Always great breakfast here . Omelets are the best . They 're huge and always perfectly done . Wait staff is always friendly and attentive . My go to breakfast place<->1
Amazing pizza , cool interior and a really nice chef in the open kitchen . Service OK .<->1
Too SLOW ! Drive thru is a pain , if I did n't Love the Fajita Spicy Flatbread , I would just go across the street to KFC . Good Food , Very Slow service :(<->2
I tried the Asada burrito and the el pastor tacos , definitely authentic and awesome Mexican ? food . Bonus for the salsa ? bar and condiment selections .<->1
Dominic Santos would n't answer the phone . Too tired to drive to Angelo 's . Romeo 's is stingy with the cheese , sauce and the toppings . Pizza tastes like Georgio 's at three times the price . No seating carry out / delivery only .<->0
The shiitake mushroom bun and the pork belly ramen were insanely good .<->1
This place is worth the 20min drive . The sushi is delicious . The names of the rolls are entertaining and the staff is nice .<->1
Decent food if you want a quick fix , fast service . Significant language barrier and it was difficult to order and get description of the food .<->0
Overpriced . You can get the same chinese buns at other bakeries at a better price . Be aware that they charge $ 0.25 if you want to use your debit card , and credit card is not accepted .<->0
Food : MediocreService : non - existence Price : over - pricedCleanness : I wonder why this place is still open . Overall rating : 0.5 star<->0
Great food . I loved it , especially the times I did n't find a piece of plastic in my pakoras .<->2
Delicious place for food . Nice ambience . Book far in advance . Great service . Check out the cocktail - it comes with crab legs !<->1
Omg ! ! If you do n't try anything else , just get their chocolate covered banana ! ! I highly recommend this even for the non - chocolate lovers . I promise you wo n't regret it ! !<->1
I will not go to any event / night out that I 'm invited to that involves the Madison . It will also result in a Facebook unfriending .<->0
Sure its sweet spot is corporate and tourist visitors in search of an ' old west ' experience but it has enough charm and a decent enough menu to justify putting on some denim and making the visit yourself .<->2
very friendly ice cream is delicious no wait time ... will most definitely go again<->1
I 'm reviewing this on their dessert . Hands down the best cheesecake ! It has praline sauce to go with it and it 's to die for . I will be stopping by here just for that before I leave arizona , lol .<->1
Great " First Date " to start the morning . Definitely will be back each time I 'm in town . Looking forward to trying the rest of the menu .<->1
My girlfriend 's BBQ chicken nachos were not any good and the hot wings had a weird taste to them that made me feel sick . Wo n't be eating here ever again .<->0
Best value on the strip , clearly popular and for good reason . Plan on eating big and getting big flavor .<->1
Waiting system is second to none . Extremely organized queuing system . A great breakfast place substituting same old hotel buffet breakfast<->1
Some very yummy steak , brisket , sweet potato fries and biscuits ! Good service . Good place to watch the football game .<->1
Great space . Very accommodating . Very professional . Looks good and the drinks are made just right .<->1
Good variety of foods and drinks ! I had a party of 17 - 18 people here . We all paid separate and they accommodate all of us !<->1
I have only ever eaten the breakfast ( egg and avocado sandwich ) and pastries ( cupcakes and bear claws ) here , and both are very good ! ! The staff is very friendly and efficient .<->1
Sat here for an hour and nothing was brought over no food it is completely empty . All we got was drinks Susie was amazing and very sorry but management never even came over to the table to apologize<->0
Good products . Not worth the wait in line . Currently in line for a register . It 's been 30 minutes and looking much longer .<->0
Fresh food always , however they could work on their customer service at the drive thru . Some of those employees clearly do not want to be there .<->2
Delish fried chicken and great mission . Mashed potatoes are awesome , would love to have grits on the menu at lunch !<->1
Damn good p - za but , fyi its only one $ relative to the location . 6 $ a slice ? But if your drunk hungry and close , then its definitely worth it . Cheers<->1
This restaurant was a great find ! Everything was fresh , healthy and the taste was amazing ! ! I will be back the next time I am in Scottsdale .<->1
Best barbacoa tacos ever ! Extremely delicious ! I am a new fan !<->1
Great food with comfortable prices . Free Thai tea with yelp check in . Ca n't wait to get the best chicken wings in town .<->1
Love it ! Great ! ! ! Food was amazing but the service was simple AWESOME !<->1
Absolutely love this place ! Great food great service everything is always on point ! Just open one in the west valley is all I ask of you haha please please<->1
I liked the smushed burger . It 's crispy , and I enjoy things that are crispy . Staff is friendly , place is clean . Good fast food place that does n't have a drive thru .<->1
The food is horrible . We had the teriyaki chicken bowl and 3 sushi roles . All were garbage . And over priced .<->0
Had the Katsu Curry and it was delicious . Ca n't wait to go back , I 've been thinking about it ever since - it 's the perfect cold weather comfort food .<->1
Fantastic ! ! ! Best burger I have had in many years ! Fries fresh cut and hot ! Would not have guessed walking into the back of a house that this place would be any good . Also , cheaper than McDs .<->1
This place served watered down Tom ka soup , the tofu was basically slime . Even the Tom yum was bad . Do n't waste your money here there are way better options for Thai not far away .<->0
Great option for fast food Style watch . Everything 's fresh and natural . The flavor profiles are great . I would definitely come back here .<->1
Food was absolutely amazing ! But do nt do martinis literally NO liquor in them . So be careful ! ! Other than that enjoy !<->0
I absolutely love this place and this is my first time going here . The presentation of the food was very nice and service was quick and friendly . I definitely recommend this if you want Japanese food .<->1
This is our favorite for Tacos . Surf and Turf Burrito is a solid choice to satisfy the craving . Friday nights can be very busy because of the Margaritas .<->1
Awesome place for a great hot dog ! My boyfriend is from Chicago and loves this place !<->1
This had to be the worst meal I have had while visiting Arizona ! ! My suggestion is " do n't go "<->0
Burgers were juicy and the ghost pepper sauce made my eyes water . Sweet potato fries were bottomless and the Red Robin lager quenched my thirst .<->1
Damn good craw fish & shrimp .<->1
You have the best Asian chicken salad by far . The portion size is perfect and I love how thinly you slice the chicken . I leave feeling full and healthy . The spicy meatball sandwich is also and outstanding dish .<->1
Great , great service . Fun Texas decor . Wonderful home cooking . Becoming our favorite neighborhood restaurant .<->1
Very good service , food & drinks ! Everything is very affordable . Our waitress was Rose she is the best ! Definitely recommend this place , the manager is doing such a good job at this location .<->1
Had famous sandwich which has tons of beef brisket in it . It was so tender . It makes me feel like going back there again .<->1
I love the decor ... Great service and fantastic food ... Next time I 'll be in Toronto I 'll definitely come back ... Highly recommend ...<->1
Good place for lunch . Brunch is very good and usually a packed house . Entire crew is efficient , knowledgeable . Never been for dinner so your on your own<->1
New Dragon Express is so yummy ! The Amazing chicken is amazing . The shrimp tempura rolls are delicious . We have ordered many different things off the menu and are happy with all of them . The waitress is always so friendly .<->1
Best sushi in Madison . Creative , high - quality options and always welcoming . Jimmy is a great server , attentive and personable .<->1
Ashley was prompt and took my order quick , the Fish Burrito was excellent ! I was in and out in less than 5 Minutes Thanks Ashley ! !<->1
basically repackaged version of kupfert and kim . i got the cauliflower tahini bowl and it was alright<->2
I recently just discovered this place . Everything from the food to the smoothies .. healthy & delicious ! The Chicken Marguerite , Turkey Sandwich & the Just Peachy smoothie are so good !<->1
This place is very good . I always get the fish tacos and a preparada . The cevich is also very good . It 's a small menu but every thing on there is made just right .<->1
Such a fantastic spot for healthy , delicious , quick Greek food . I come here often as its close to me and every time I 'm pleased !<->1
The spices in the food make love to your senses without making you sweat . Every dish was an explosion of complimentary flavors and warm textures . I am addicted ! So glad i found this Gem !<->1
Totally disappointed at this dinning experience , the food here even worse than the school cafeteria . Not worth to spend money in here .<->0
Adorable little spot that is great for a little day drinking . Lunch menu is a bit limited but food is decent . Comfortable atmosphere and friendly service .<->1
Excellent food great service however the lady at the front needs people skills . Can be rude<->2
Very good food at a great price . We love the gouda pretzels and kolachi . Casual and relaxed atmosphere with no frills . Just excellent baked goods .<->1
We visit Ramen Sora every time we go to Vegas ! Best ramen we 've had . Totally worth the wait ! !<->1
The service is terrible every . single . time . Even when it is not crowded , I find myself waiting and waiting for service . The food is decent , but I would suggest Emiliano 's down the street instead .<->0
They had a coupon in the entertainment guide so I decided to check it out . I went to use it and they would n't let me and claimed they had no knowledge of the coupon . Very disappointing .<->0
I love this place not crowded nice atmosphere and great food after a late night shift .<->1
Great place for breakfast / brunch . The Works Omelet was very good and the warm banana nut muffin with butter was awesome . Natasha gave great recommendations and was a terrific waitress . Send her to Disney !<->1
Amazon and food and service ! Nick was a fantastic server ! Top marks ! Order the braised octopus tacos ! Muito delicioso !<->1
Great food great music and a must see view ! Definitely recommend to anyone visiting Las Vegas ! Happy hour from 5 pm to 8p m is amazing as well<->1
We hit this place while in the area and loved it . Great service , yummy food and strong drinks ;)<->1
Foods great .. service slow perhaps just a bad day will try again<->2
Been there just once & found it satisfactory . I specifically liked the soup - in - bread - bowl idea a lot . The sandwiches were good too .<->2
Best happy hour in Scottsdale . Love it . Regular menu is great too . Great steaks and fish . Service always great . Wonderful ambiance<->1
Food taste like school cafeteria food but all you can drink beer and wine for two hours for 10.00 was worth it<->0
The salted carmel fudge ice cream is insanely amazing ! Never tried anything else like it . Great variety of cookies and ice cream flavors . We will be back again . Sooo good ! !<->1
I am a regular here every weekend . The chicken sandwich and the peppercorn burger are outstanding . Love the PBR on tap ! Great place and wonderful bartenders !<->1
As someone who enjoys Greek food , I 'm not coming back here ! The food portions are ok in size but almost every other Greek restaurant I 've been to is tastier and do n't even get me started about the service !<->0
Huge variety and options . No complaints from our table - everything was delicious and our server Karla was super helpful and friendly . The banana nut muffins are indeed to die for .<->1
Great addition to Fiesta District . Energetic staff always puts me in a good mood and starts my day off right .<->1
Excellent experience every time I step inside . Lots of authentic Turkish foods and beverages . Clean dining room . The owner is one of the most friendly and welcoming guys around . Definitely a go - to for a quick bite or a sit - down meal .<->1
By far my favorite craft brewery outpost in Tempe . Like their seasonal offerings . Can not rate food as I only have beers there :)<->1
Got a burger here as we came around lunch . The bun as really good . The staff was extremely friendly .<->1
Great pumpkin dessert !<->1
Great food ! Fast service ! Awesome workers ! Business is run the way all should be , attentive to customers & tasty food !<->1
Tasted like a mexicanized shawarma .. so , good but not really Mexican . I may end up there again .<->2
So glad they expanding this fabulous little place to get great food . Everything I 've had here is tasty tasty tasty ! ! !<->1
Fantastic place for anyone who loves a good burger . Choose any burger you want and pay the price of that while adding as many toppings as you please with no extra charge !<->2
This place is awesome but I 'm so disappointed that they decided to close for the summer to travel . This is the note that was left on the front door<->2
My first time trying fish tacos . The BBQ mahi tacos from Cabo are delicious ! Service was great too . I 'll be coming here every time I come to Charlotte !<->1
best sushi spot in Brampton . Food is delicious , fresh and authentic Japanese . Polite friendly service<->1
Used to be much better . I do n't know if there is a new owner but just not as good or generous .<->2
Best customer service and healthy natural options ... I stopped using starbucks and when in Henderson love to stop for a great cup of coffee :)<->1
Great Mexican food . Prices are fair and the food is consistently amazing . This place is always packed , but seems to have just one more table for us to sit as soon as we walk in , and great , fast service .<->1
Great food and good place to watch the game ! One of my favs ! Very friendly staff will make you feel like this is your own version of Cheers . Weekly specials are great value as well .<->1
Just a corner store ! Nothing special and do nt have a lot of the stuff i really like . Just two stars .<->0
This place has great fried rice . Egg drop soup is to die for . I travel alot and now other Chinese food place just do n't cut it anymore<->1
Love this place ! The food and drink are great but it 's a little crammed inside , space wise .<->1
Great coffee ! ! I love the vanilla lattes and the dirty chai teas are bomb , My Sis & I love coffee and this coffee spot has to be in my top ten faves :)<->1
Fun club ! My favorite part was dancing and watching the bellagio fountain go off . Very cool experience :)<->1
The place was packed . The drinks were fantastic , so was the food and not to forget great service !<->1
I have been coming here for years . Nothing but great fish and chips . Big portions , great taste at unbelievable prices . Great service , a Weston Village icon .<->1
Meh . I was underwhelmed with the quality of food yet overwhelmed by its proportions . Staff is friendly and attentive . But the decor is atrocious and the music is horrible !<->0
Amazing ice cream . Unfortunately they close during winter season ! Definitely will go again once they open . My wife is crazy about ice cream , and every time we 're in the area , we stop at toms for ice cream .<->1
Food was good ! You can definitely tell they do n't put MSG on their food . Parking could be better though , whenever I go there , it 's really hard to find a spot to park .<->2
Best Thai food in town . Yes , it does n't say much when you realize this is in Gastonia but this is as good as the Pineville location .<->1
Bad place to eat , tastes like dog food , bland and no taste , I swear they use canned dog food or some garbage , this place I will never go to again !<->0
Delicious food , great service , fun environment ! ! The waiters suggestion was on point and the live music was a great atmosphere enhancer .<->1
Wasabi not super fresh but very good service and sushi was great !<->1
Gnocchi in a bread bowl ... AMAZING . Melts in your mouth . Pretty large portion and a had enough to take for lunch the next day . Service was great .<->1
I love the service here , the staff are respectful , pleasant and helpful . The pollo fundito is excellent , with big , juicy chunks of chicken instead of shredded .<->1
My go - to place when I want Mexican . Pollo Fundido is excellent , Chili Relleno is my go - to comfort food . We always feel welcome . It can feel close , but the place was a house at one time .<->1
Food was ok ! They did not give us the sauce which was listed in the order . Portion was huge but it was dry we ordered the chicken shawarma bowl .<->2
OMG ! ! ! Best barbecue EVER ! ! We will definitely be back ! The ribs were my favorite , I did n't really like barbecue until I tried this place .<->1
Best authentic Cantonese food in the entire AZ . We drive from south Chandler ( 50 miles ) once a month to enjoy the food .<->1
This wdefinitely a disappointment . The bagels are decent , I guess . But no where near a true " back east bagel " . I ordered my bagel with strawberry cream cheese and it tasted exactly like Philadelphia cream cheese , bleh .<->0
One of the better buffets in downtown . A lot of varieties . Pork chops are great . Pizza , is good too as well as the Mexican food .<->1
This is the areas best Thai food restaurant . Pad see we and pad bai gra pow are both outstanding . Coconut or mango homemade ice cream for dessert . Highly recommended !<->1
The best breakfast in town . I have not had a single bad experience at any Snooze location . If you are a meat and potatoes person , they have a pile of hash browns with whatever fixings you want !<->1
You know you are in the best bakery when the heavenly aroma of sweet goodies welcome you in ! Can not wait to go back !<->1
BEST DELIVERY IN AREA ! Portions were incredibly big and very dish was so tasty ! Will order again and again . We will have the fried rice in our fridge even after feeding on it 3 times !<->1
Stopped in to Barnes & Noble today and we enjoyed a Starbucks while we were there ... thus one is nit full service , but the have Cheesecake Factory cheesecake ! Service was great !<->1
Pho broth is good and they have some other good order . Tried the satay egg noodle after my sister had ordered it and it was bomb ! !<->1
Love that they hav valet parking and awesome service .<->1
My parents ' favorite place to eat in Phoenix . Here is what they would say : The Mojitos were outstanding and both of our dishes were amazing . Ca n't wait to go back again on a date night .<->1
I 've been here a couple times and liked it a lot . The staff was nice and they seemed to pump out fresh food pretty quickly .<->1
Good place to get your AYCE sushi ! Great service , always accommodating we are regulars and enjoy this place often .<->1
Service was good but food was bad . Worse than eggsmart . Ordered the potato pancakes . I suppose if you like a lot of salt this is the place for you .<->0
Amazing experience ! I had the herb chicken with fresh vegetables , best I have ever had ! We even got to meet the chef Scott Cummings .<->1
Poor food , laughably high price , incredibly SLOW service despite the place being empty . Avoid .<->0
Fresh , local , delicious . Go on Wednesday to try their homebrew for less .<->1
This is my family 's favorite Mexican restaurant . Supreme nachos are great . And so is the shrimp fundido .<->1
On point , best all you can eat sushi in town ! Service was very nice and Fast . Sitting at the bar is where to be !<->1
5 stars on the Super bagel selection or school here ! Great weds deal buy . 12 get 18 bagels ! They do excellent in their supplied freezer bags too for later ! The bailys are great too ! 4 stars on the Reuben and fries .<->1
The coffee is amazing ! They also have pastries and tea ! The owners are extremely friendly ! Also , family owned and operated ! Great neighborhood addition ! Very clean !<->1
This place serves authentic Italian pizza . I know because I used to live in Italy . By far the best restaurant pizza in the US that I have tasted ! Well worth the drive every time .<->1
Apple is the most inviting host that there is in the world and she has the most amazing sesame chicken<->1
Awesome food and service . Trusted yelp and was not disappointed . Owners are attentive and " have a dream " .<->1
Too bad this place closed . We went one time shortly after they first opened and thought it was decent . Tacos great , steak burrito was a little much , guac and chips outstanding .<->1
Great atmosphere , service , and food ! A bit pricier than your " Outbacks " and what not , but well worth the money . Advanced reservations is definitely recommended .<->1
Service is now poor due to the fact they expanded their dining room . Hire more help please .<->2
Very good place ... Quite and friendly people . We had Pho which tasted great ... Not too salty and beef broth is flavorful . We also got shrimp skewers . Presentation was better than most Pho restaurants .<->1
I love this place . Food reminds me of my mom 's cooking . Decent price and very friendly staff .<->1
Came here in the afternoon Pros Huge portionsVery well pricedQuick service ConsCould use a couple more flavours as most of them were generic<->1
Wonderful service , awesome steak and sides . They were very accommodating to my gluten allergy . Wonderful experience .<->1
Sweet potato fries . So yummy . Best . Too bad they do n't have more seating , this place gets PACKED .<->1
The best burger I have ever had . Period . The only negative thing was the person behind the bar changed the station when the song " It Was n't Me " came on . lol Love that song ! ! !<->1
Have to say ice cream was great . Love the flavors that they offered and I have to suggest that you get with the bubble waffle .<->1
Love this place food is so good and Alana was our server and she was awesome ! Thanks so much for a great lunch !<->1
Nice service , short wait , perfect location right next to fro - yo and some shops . Nothing spectacular , but the quick wait made for easy pick - up - and - go . Overall , a good experience .<->1
Poor customer service and overpriced food that arrived cold . Wonder how long this place will last ...<->0
This place is delicious ! I have dreams of the fettuccine Alfredo I had there . It 's conveniently located in Cityscape and close to lightrail . I ca n't wait to go back !<->1
Le Macaron went out of their way to deliver our order , we live out of state and they were so accommodating to us . Prompt delivery and perfect presentation . Our clients were blown away ! Five stars !<->1
Ca n't wait until Friday to hear the music of Thom Crompton . Should be a blast . Good food , good music . it do n't get much better<->1
not bad not bad .. for a buffet sushi , it was n't all too bad .. cooked foods were o - k , but i thought it was pretty decent for a buffet .. and really hapy that they had green tea ice cream for dessert !<->1
Super Fantastic Thai food ! ! Only issue I had was with the size of the plates to the space on the table we sat at .. I highly recommend this place ! Cost is also not bad for such great food ..<->1
Wolfie always sets the standard . Great food great service a very fair price how can you ask for more .<->1
Great Jewish deli . Excellent corned beef . They also have a fully stocked bar . Breakfast anytime . Convenient location off of I - 271 . Casual attire . I 'll definitely be going back .<->1
I ordered half chicken extra crispy last week and it was horrible . The chicken was still raw inside and we got really sick . I will never order from this place again<->0
Fantastic burgers made fresh every day . Pleasant atmosphere and fast service . Good prices for great food .<->1
Pretty solid pizza , definitely a different taste . Really liked the garlic salt on the crust . Definitely recommend for it to be added to your rotation of pizza places in the OC / Tremont area .<->1
I just went here and they have bad stuff that kids can see . They also have a no refund policy . Do n't get stuff that you think wo n't work !<->2
Breathtaking views with the most phenomenal food around ! The wine pairing completes the experience with an amazing Sommelier ( Robert ) .<->1
Cute spot we found on yelp . Wings were great and crispy and spicy . Pizza was delicious not too thick .<->1
For healthy low calorie food , it is delicious ! The customer service from employees is outstanding !<->1
Always have a great time at Tamari . They have a great happy hour , but be warned its only available at the bar , not at a table . I have never had bad food here !<->1
Great ice cream ! $ 7.50 for a medium . One thing did bother me though ... NO one wore GLOVES .<->1
Definitely our " go to " Chinese close to home ! Prices are great , service is courteous ( even with special requests ) and the food has always been good .<->1
This place is a favorite of mine - delicious ! Walk in , outside seating only - best fries on earth .<->1
Another pricy joint , but if your into collecting anything M & M , this is your place , especially for the kids . Its just like the Coke store . TC<->1
Be careful eating here , overcharged two visits out of three and sushi contents are not what is listed on the menu . I gave this place three chances and they failed all three .<->0
This restaurant was great ! I went for breakfast and was not disappointed - good value for money and portions .<->1
I love the decor so much , the lighting and colours are so nice . We ordered the pan fried dumplings and the spicy and sour soup - both were very good ! Also inexpensive so that 's always a plus .<->1
Love love ! ! Amazing atmosphere ! ! Employees very knowledgeable about everything on the menu ! ! And the food is breathtaking ! ! Just simply amazing ! ! Highly recommend l ! I ca n't wait to come back ! !<->1
Great owners . Cool staff . Fresh oysters . The cheese selection is divine . Oh - and the wine is well priced , it 's dark and romantic , and I can walk home .<->1
These are the best wings in the world ! Sweet jalapeño burger is to die for , do n't forget the delicious fries and onion rings . Service was awesome ! ! ! This place is fantastic :) !<->1
* * Ladies * * try the Lambic Black Cherry Ale . It 's so good - and so is the Rasberry Framboise . This is a cool spot when you want to be casual , and get friendly service . It satisfies my monthly dive bar craving .<->1
I went here for a sugar shack dinner . The food was fatty and sweet , which was expected and great ! The food seemed to keep on coming and unending . Not to mention the maple taffy at the bar .<->2
It 's good pho but they force you to pay 18 % gratuity in groups more than 4 . That is pretty high for no service .<->0
Just sat in the drive thru 15 minutes for them to tell me my order was n't even started . This location needs help from the mall workers .<->0
Very , very authentic mexican food , one of the best Mexican food places in Phoenix , AZ . They 're salsas are really good as well<->1
The service was slow and the chicken was super greasy .<->0
Great food and service and the talent is also extraordinary . Consistently top notch food .<->1
This place would get four stars from me if it just was nt so expensive . I mean who wants to spend 10 dollars for coffee and a bagel . Not me<->2
My place to go for relaxing enjoyable breakfast or brunch , dinner menu can benefit from more choices . In general great place to indulge yourself without breaking the bank !<->1
Went here once , had a chicken sandwich . It was roast chicken , lettuce , and mayo on a fresh Portuguese bun . Not sophisticated , but just what I was expecting . Abundant tasty chicken , reasonable price , and yes , cramped tables .<->1
Food was great as always service was spectacular I would recommend Candace as your server . portions are really big so be prepared to take some home<->1
B × itchy servers . Horrible and greasy food had a hard time accommodating my two year with food in my opinion I would save your money and time and try some else<->0
The bakery department did an excellent job on my sons 1st Birthday cake ! ! Everyone commented on how wonderful it tasted and asked where it I got it from . Highly recommend vanilla with buttercream frosting ca n't go wrong . Thanks team bakery !<->1
When I ca n't go eat fish tacos in Mexico , I come here . Great fish tacos ! ! My favorite is the full taco . The fries are great too !<->1
Not sure how this restaurant gets good rating . I walked in and saw a man smoking a cigarette in the kitchen . Walked out right away . The restaurant is empty with no customers . Yelpers , are you still reliable ?<->0
This place is the bomb if you 're looking for flavorful Latin American food - like food truck tasty !<->1
Lots of food variety to chose from . One of the best buffets I have tried .<->1
The pictures look great but the food is bland , rude servers slow service these was no special touch to this place<->0
Nutella latte is the best ! This place is a gem in the middle of downtown . A very low key cafe inside a comic store . I love local places these .<->1
Not enough meat n veggies are keep in a steam table overlooking , veggies look like mushy vegetables . Save ur cash ...<->0
The food here is AMAZING - and the people who work here are gorgeous , which is never a bad thing . Eat here NOW ! ! !<->1
We gave this place a try because it was close to the Hard Rock Hotel where we were staying . Everything was reasonable and good without any complaints . The icecream mochi is a must try .<->1
Drove up from Scarborough to go on Easter Sunday . Fantastic food . The bulgogi soup is so great . Good side dishes too . Might even be better than the Christie location !<->1
Jukebox is a safe bet when you 're in the west island and in the mood for good comfort food . Service is prompt , portions are generous and prices are totally reasonable . They make one of the best veggie burgers in town - IMO .<->1
I really enjoyed this place . Our server was very friendly and the menu had a lot of options . Our food came within 10 - 15 minutes of offering it . I 'd come back during my next visit to Cleveland<->1
Understand why they make you pay first otherwise everyone would walk out . Has to be the slowest and most disorganized place in Vegas . Not to mention way overpriced for average food .<->0
Great experience with The Velvet Buttercream . The cake was above and beyond my expectations ! Great customer service , can pay easily online , and offers delivery !<->1
The Kimchi fried rice is so worth it . Good portion and really tasty . The pork bone soup is another good item . Bulgogi bento box is cheap for the amount t of food you get . Cash only though .<->1
We tried the Bellagio Buffet and the Wynn Buffet , nothing worth those around $ 50 per person . But McDonald 's is always McDonald 's , cheap and fast and fair price .<->1
This place is very friendly and welcoming ! I go here on an occasion and the service is really good . The employees are very kind and the car wash is great as well . Definitely will come back !<->1
Fast service , fresh sushi , large pieces , friendly staff , and cheap . My lunch special ( 12 pieces - 6 California and 6 salmon avocado , with side salad and miso soup ) was around $ 11 .<->1
Great prices better than Lee 's ! Super knowledgeable not only in wine but spirits as well . Yes they really do mean more ... lots more . Sign up for their emails so you get their coupons .<->1
Same like any other CPK you can find . Great service when I came here in November .<->2
it is a good one and the view of outside dinning is awesome.the waiting time is a little bit long , so I suggest to make an appointment in advance .<->1
Food is OK , it is over priced but it was beautifully decorated during X'mas season .<->2
I had Death By Chocolate . Now I am dead and loving it .<->1
The seating area is open . the staff are helpful ad friendly . The choices of sandwiches is really going to cover any taste your looking for . The same for the soups .<->1
Tacos and authentic Mexican dishes were deliciosso ! A wide variety of tequila drinks as well<->1
Very delicious Persian stew type food . I have been to this place 3/4 times and I always tend to order from their specials . The food is always flavorful and delicious . I would recommend going there for sure ! :)<->2
Great selection ! Fresh Dungenesss crab and Philippine 's mango ice cream ! An absolute superset of Far East , and maybe Green Onion too . I wish I 've come here sooner .<->1
Went here for winterlicious . For the view.and it was amazing ! ! ! Food is above average , but not the greatest . But service Is a bit slow and not as friendly .<->1
Thanks to Tom , Ryan & and everyone else who helped to make my office lunch great ! We all loved our food and smoothies . Expect a call from us again soon .<->1
Our favorite place in Tempe for Mexican . My wife goes for the Gollo burrito and I the Machaca both green style . It 's fantastic and pretty cheap .<->1
Beijing Express is great . We order delivery from them all the time . Walnut Shrimp , General Tso chicken , fried rice and chicken lo mein are all excellent . Definitely give them a shot<->1
The whole store is so fun and cute ! The buns are amazing and the staff is very friendly .<->1
Food was fabulous ! Came here for a late mothers ' day dinner , best service I think I have ever received at a restaurant . Great job guys !<->1
Got the chopped Italian , it 's alright . I 'll try a sandwich next time . I would give it another go though .<->2
Quite the disappointment . Got a regular drip . Very bitter . Plus the guy collecting my payment made sure I saw the tip feature before moving on . Really ? You took my order and poured a ( not very good ) coffee .<->0
I love this place ! ! ! You get lots for your order and the food taste yummy and clean ! ! ! One of our favourite food spots ! ! !<->1
Awesome place and friendly service , my kids love their specialty pancakes ! I like how friendly and attentive the servers are . Even when it 's busy it is worth the wait :)<->1
Been coming here for awhile now . Have had breakfast , lunch and dinner several times each . Always excellent . Organic , gluten free , as well as standard fare always available . Its always 4 of us and never had a disappointing meal .<->1
The Biryani was good , but the Chicken tikka Masala was Outstanding ! Loved it .. good , friendly staff and great service as well !<->1
Literally obsessed with this place ! Sooo cute , great food , bottomless brunch and DW himself is AMAZING ! ! It 's the best thing ever to see an owner operator so involved love it ! Oh and side note the carrot cake is orgasmic<->1
Greasy faux rustic bar . Decent beer selection . nachos are good but the wings ( one of their specialties ) not so much . 2.5 stars is probably a more accurate rating .<->0
Yum ! Went twice during my three day long trip to Phoenix . The menu is quite extensive , something for everyone !<->1
Cool place ! Myself and a party of 5 came here to celebrate and eat dinner for my sister 's Bachelorette party ... The food was very good . The service was good , and we enjoyed our time here !<->1
Disappointed . It 's does n't have a lot of favors for soft serve . Great for the little ones who want a snow cone . Other than that ... That 's it .<->0
First time ever here . I am so upset I have n't tried this sooner ! The price is great . The staff was friendly . The place is clean . I will become a regular for sure !<->1
Timmy 's donuts and Timbits are always good treats . Manager at work bought these in and they were pretty good and fresh . Ca n't go wrong to bring these into the office for meetings .<->1
The pate was amazing . I also had the pork chop which was a hit . Service was fantastic . I 'll be back here soon .<->1
Seriously , if I lived in the area I 'd eat here all of the time . Hands down best tacos in the world . That is all .<->1
Really good food at extremely reasonable prices . Our faves - any schnitzel sandwich at $ 5 / each , chicken wings ( would reco getting 2 orders ) $ 5 / each and the potato salad $ 3 small / $ 5 large ( which are 2 smalls - generous amount ) .<->1
Great neighborhood Thai restaurant . Perfect for pick up or delivery . Dine in is ok ... wait staff is always friendly and we 're never left waiting . Excellent coconut soup ! !<->1
I love the espresso ! The dark chocolate ice cream is divine . This coffee is a gem in the junction , there are also tasty empanadas you can eat aswell .<->1
nice and easy . standard american menu , everything you would need on a standard menu . good food , nothing too fancy . a bit expensive but you are in vegas at the bellagio . they are open late which is a plus .<->2
First time was a few weeks ago and we 've been once a week since then . Every time we go we have great food and good service . I love how casual and family friendly it feels .<->1
Their beef shawarma is very delicious . They grill the meat before putting it in the wrap so it develops a nice char & smoky flavour . I will definitely be back . They are very friendly here . It 's a family - run place .<->1
Had a big problem with the Henderson location and the managers made it right ASAP . I greatly appreciate that they took the time to fix the issue promptly .<->1
Great neighborhood bar ! Staff is friendly and good service . We had the sliders and they were fab . Prices are reasonable and they pour a good drink . They are new and here to stay ! !<->1
Drive to another Panera instead of this one every time . Even st 8 : 30PM with no one line I still waited over 35 minutes for a Pick 2 . During lunch it 's even worse .<->0
Loved this place .. I am addicted .. I entered the store not knowing what to expect . I was enthusiastically greeted and offered free samples . I ended up buying enough popcorn to feed my entire neighborhood . I will definitely be back for more .<->1
SO good . Anything you want ready for your salad . The veggie burgers and fries are delicious . Plus eat and park ranch is AMAZING . I love this place .<->1
Great ambiance but the steak was very tough . The steak was pricey and so not worth it but the wine was great and the table and service very nice . I would go again , just not to order the steak .<->2
Not sure how this place is not 5 stars but the hot sour soup is the best I have ever had and kiddo loves the honey chicken ! ! ! Delivery is fast and food is always hot when it arrives<->1
2 hour wait even when calling ahead to order . Ended up leaving without receiving the food . Tables where being half served .<->0
The cream coconut buns were amazing . The baking was all very fresh and tasty . Just remember cash only .<->1
Oh my TOGOS is back ! ! ! Just like back home in San Jose , Ca . Great sandwiches . Delicious Broccoli Cheddar Soup ! ! ! Ill be back ! ! ! Great service too ! !<->1
Meh the food was decent but the place was kinda weird . There 's other better Asian places than this one and this is the last time I 'll go to this one tho<->2
Food was so k but an 830 last call ( not the first time for us ) is horrible . Servers act as if there doing you a favor ... I am very over it<->0
Tried this place as we were just down the street ! ! Amazing ! ! Food is delicious ! Staff are incredibly friendly and accommodating ! We will be back for sure ! ! !<->1
Excellent food and courteous staff . A little tough to get in which only proves how good it is !<->1
Outlaw burger did n't stand a chance . Place is freaking good .<->1
Good food at really nice price ( $ 15 per head ) Specially fruit custard and carrot dessert . Also the veg pakora<->1
0/10 I was treated horribly and the staff acted like I was stupid . I will never come here again and have never felt so disrespected .<->0
Surprisingly good . The crust was darn near perfect . The toppings fresh . And reasonably priced . We will keep this place in mind for future pizza cravings .<->1
Food generally good , waitress did n't stagger food enough for our table of seven so we had to keep making room for dishes , drinks expensive , gluten free charge bogus do n't drive here no where to park !<->2
Ca n't get a small size solo , have to buy a full size role which is way too big . The frosting is pure sugar - waaay to sweet and the roll was a total disappointment . Cinnabon is way better .<->0
Bolognese and funghi pasta at $ 10 a plate made the house - made pasta extra delicious ! 1/2 price drinks during happy hour as well !<->1
Always get the Mongolian beef spicy # 7 . You tend to get better service if you have someone asian in your group .<->1
The food is really good here . Unfortunately , the management and service is horrible . Very disorganized and the manager seems clueless .<->0
Very disappointing . Twin dragon burrito is a too hard to eat hand roll with a lot of filler . Had a build your own and it was tasteless except for the overly hot jalapeño . Service was good .<->0
Taiwanese dessert , so yummy .. make sure you get the signature taro ... it reminds me of my childhood in Taiwan<->1
We just went here Saturday night and had the best plain pizza ! ! I 've been searching for a good east coast style pizza and have found it . We will be back !<->1
Fair - but cheap ! $ 5.99 lunch special was good , qualizty lcked .<->2
Small place but good food and good service and not expensive ! ! ! Ca n't wait to take the family from out of state<->1
Love the flavors not just some ordinary Japanese Restuarant , the ambiance and customers service is always on point .<->1
Nothing fancy here , just good solid pho and Vietnamese food . Best pho and Viet food in Brampton that I 've had .<->2
This place has the very best breakfast burritos you will ever have , under $ 5huge filling and always cooked perfectly ... fantastic ~ ~<->1
CHICKEN 88 ! that s all have to say . My all - time favourite lunch item . This place makes fabulous food ! ! !<->1
Taco Tuesday is really great , food is good , free chips are great ! . I m not sure about the other food have n't tired it but want too .<->2
Chicken Fried rice was bad . Jeera rice is like it came out of ghee pot . White rice n goat curry were good . Ambiance is great<->0
Not bad , not great .. but convenient like going to In and Out .. I will have to try it again ..<->0
Do n't bother calling in a order they do n't remember to put it in . Their food is good but the chicken is under sauced ..<->0
The bowls were hollow ! Good taste , I got the Maui wowie , but not worth the cost for a snack .<->2
It was great while it was in business . Rest in peace Kodiak produce . May you rise like Jesus<->1
Just discovered this place recently ! What can I say . It 's a pretty solid pho place . The pho soup base is on point , one of the best I 've had . People talk quite loud here but it just adds to the authenticity !<->1
It has slowly but surely gone downhill . Friday night and it 's empty so I think other people are thinking the same thing . They messed up every dish we ordered .<->0
Sushi was very fresh , and tasted great . Definitely some of my favorite Calgary sushi ! Also , the service was very friendly and on time . I 'm going to go again , and you should go too !<->1
Lamb Lollipops were good . The sides were not good . The service was poor . Sat at bar for 5 minutes before someone addressed me . The restaurant was not packed .<->0
The owners husband and wife are very helpful and speak English well . You can taste and they have several options cold ready for your picnic ! Rosé all day !<->1
Absolutely down right discussing . The greece and oil seeped through the paper plate . The cheese was jewel and they gave me a whopping 5 pieces of pepperoni . Stay away !<->0
These guys are honest an thorough I would recommend there service to anyone . They also are competitively priced and on time<->1
Was in Mesa and stumbled upon Casanova Bros . ! Tony was so welcoming and made us feel like family ! Food was delicious and served quickly ! Will definitely be back ! !<->1
I got a chocolate shake and the chicken sandwich . The shake was runny and not very good . The chicken sandwich was pretty good . I would go back again .<->2
Very nice Japanese restaurant in the neighbour but slightly expensive . Great menu selection . High quality of food with great customer service .<->1
Ordered the Royal Delight , everything about it was amazing . Portion sizes here are large , so the prices are pretty reasonable . The eel was very good as well . Waitress was very friendly and engaging . Will be returning soon .<->1
Excellent food and with the use of Skipthedishes.com delivery was made on time and the food hot ! Great restaurant , would highly recommend .<->1
The only reason why these delicious tacos are not getting 5 stars is because they are a bit over prices . They are , however , very good .<->1
Thai Iced Tea - PERFECT . Nam Tok salad - NOT SO PERFECT . Pad See Eew - NOT COOKED WELL . NOT HOT . Service - EXCELLENT .<->2
Very tasty and authentic Chinese noodle shop . There 's only one main item on the menu so you know they 'll do it well . Cheap<->1
Disgusting and overpriced tried the two most popular items on the menu honey walnut shrimp and salt and pepper pork chops and I could n't eat past one bite .<->0
Love the place . I do n't eat kosher only however the food there reminds me of home . I try to go there at list once a weekThank you guys<->1
Great Mexican food , very authentic . Not just beans and rice ! If your in Vegas and a foodie , its worth the time off the strip !<->1
Great products . I highly recommend any of their locations . Their at Europe this year and have many products that can fit any of your health and fitness needs .<->1
Delicious pizza and excellent customer service . Pizza Heaven Bistro catered a large event for me and the quality and friendliness of staff exceeded my expectations . Will definitely be catering from them in the future .<->1
Good place for variety pizza<->1
Had the Skinny Dip yesterday . Disappointed . For $ 11 I expected a larger sub and more meat . Tasted good but when I got to the end of the sub there was no meat . Not worth the $<->2
Ordered delivery tonight and it was not good . Pizza was so greasy it was soggy and overloaded with cheese . Dessert was stale . Tasted like week old grocery store cake .<->0
I am a Whole Foods lover . this is a nice one . most are . this particular location has one cold - ass beer room . super chilled . I am currently enjoying a Chimay Triple . 8 %<->1
This restaurant has such a wonderful nostalgic memory for us . I was there with my sister in 2014 before we moved to the beach in 2015 . Hot dogs are excellent . Started going there in the 1950 ' s .<->1
Pretty good Mexican food - for Arizona . I take eastern visitors to a location near our office and they think it is authentic . I guess it is Sonoran style while I favor the good stuff in New Mexico<->2
I love this place ... I used to live above it and the owners are amazingI recommend the seafood stew ! The stuffed grape leaves are amazing and as big as caggage rolls !<->1
Love it ! Best I 've been to . All of the workers are extremely nice and attentive , as well as simply making conversation and giving advice on hookah . Also very cheap , compared to other bars . Would n't go anywhere else .<->1
Really poor quality food and slow service . Thankfully they finally patched up that giant moon crater at the front of their driveway .<->0
Sassi is n't just a meal ... it 's a culinary event . The atmosphere is incredible , and the food is beyond description ! Plan for 2 - 3 hours . Any less and you 're shorting yourself . Truly one of my favorite restaurants .<->1
Just walked out of this Starbucks and am VERY pissed off . Coffee tastes like CRAP . I asked for extra shots and they just used regular brew . NOT cool .<->0
Cool place . Food below average for price . Garlic bread and cappuccinos are the best part . Gordy , the accordion player , makes the place .<->2
Stopped by for a quick meal . Ordered the numder 1 meal add bacon . Made it home , took a bite of the burger and to my surprise no burger<->0
I had no idea about this place until i seen it on Ubereats ! Very yummy food ! Taste so fresh and healthy . I ordered the Veggie fried rice with Soy Bob Tea ! ! !<->1
Not what would one expect from the JW Marriott . The food was blah and not much selection . Will never go to this place until they upgrade the quality<->0
Amazing beef Pho , summer rolls are great and super friendly service . Best place in the East Valley for Pho ! ! !<->1
Food is great but service definitely lacks . Love coming here for lunch but they could have some better service .<->2
Gaetano 's has AMAZING food ! The service was great too . The owner waited on us and his wife worked at the door . I love that atmosphere !<->1
Best Americano I have ever had . The service is great , all the staff are really friendly . I love that they have Bunner 's supersonic vegan cookies .<->1
Great food in a fun downtown Las Vegas location with very friendly and helpful staff .<->1
Love here ! ! ! The hot pot is very good . You can choose a small one personally , or a large one share with your friends . Gill is the best sever that we got ! ! !<->1
La comida está bien ! Nada nuevo pero el servicio es lento y no muy bueno ! Sele olvidaron las tortillas ; ( . Y no regreso a checar cómo está la comida Ni nada por el estilo !<->0
Nice atmosphere and we were sat immediately on a Friday night which was nice . However and this is a big however ... I saw a huge cockroach run across the floor . HUGE ! ! ! Gordon Ramsey would have a fit !<->0
The service is efficient and friendly . I 've never seen more happy and merry staff . I enjoy the sesame loaf and the ham and cheese croissant .<->1
This place sucks ! Went on a Tuesday night and waited over 10 min to get a waitress at our table . Just got up and left ! Place looked like a ghost town !<->0
I like this place our server was great and filled every request . I ordered the stuffed peppers and they were delicious . I will be back<->1
We 've been here many times already for dinner and we highly recommend the lobster rolls ! Yum ! Fried Calamari was nicely flavored and fried . Great view and tasty food , what more can you ask for ?<->1
The food was fantastic and the service was top notch ! Our server , Ken , did an excellent job taking care of us . The whole staff was great . We had so much fun !<->1
I love this place ! Underground , cool atmosphere . Great for special occasions.and even for late night happy hours . Best Seafood in Scottsdale ! Best Oysters !<->1
Try the shabu beef salad and the takoyaki<->1
Awesome service , fresh sushi , great music . The only reason it does n't get 5 stars , because their lamps are extremely dusting and I felt uncomfortable eating around so much dust .<->1
I love this place ! Their BBQ chicken is great , but my favorite is the macaroni salad !<->1
Beer , wine , and liquor ... one stop shopping ! Love ! Oh , they also have gifts for the wine and beer lover , and yummy gourmet snacks . Wine tasting on certain days .<->1
Always great service . Friendly and timely . A perfect place for great food and community camaraderie .<->1
Employees here really take pride in their restaurant . They made sure the dining area was clean and their napkins and ketchup station was stocked up and clean . Well organized restaurant . Great job !<->1
This Subway is the closest to my office and thankfully the best one I 've been to . The employees are friendly and fast . And the sandwiches are good for Subway !<->1
Salud is the new place for Mexican food in Vegas ! Great atmosphere and great service ! Andres is the best owner ! The cocktails are amazing and the service is the best<->1
Great lunch - wrap and chili was so good . Chili on potato pancake , just wow ! Hot and fresh . Patio is one of the best in the beach . Beers were amazing . Love cruiser on tap !<->1
Definitely the place to go to stock up when you get to Vegas . Prices are great compared to other retailers on the strip . Great selection of booze , snacks , and souvenirs !<->1
Excellent appetizers , especially the chili fries and sweet potato fries . The burgers were all right , but not quite worth the price . The staff is friendly . Overall a good dining experience , but a little expensive for what you get .<->1
The food is AMAZING and always fresh ! Every time we go , we try something new . Not one thing we have tried was anything less than delicious . Nice to have a chic restaurant in Plum .<->1
This place has changed hands a few times , but I hope it stays in business . Their Chicken fried rice is terrific ! It 's too bad that they do n't know how to market their business .<->1
Great Food , Good Service ... and to show up on a Friday night at around 7 and be sat in 20 minutes .. was n't bad ... We will definetly be back ...<->1
2.25 for a taco . Not bad . Left when i saw they were 1/3 rd the actual taco . Snack sized tacos . Place near my house sells 3x the size for 2.70<->0
Our overall best meal in Vegas . The fried chicken is insane ! Loved the truffle pizza and watermelon salad . Excellent food .<->1
Absolutely the best restaurant in charlotte . The bison is delicious . But leave room for the shakes .<->1
i know this place is semi - famous , i think especially after jake gyllenhall ( sp ? ) talked about it on leno , but what is the big deal ? ? ? i just do n't understand . cole slaw ? fries ? big whoop .<->2
Staff is extremely rude when you call for take out orders . Beware of disrespectful service .<->0
Best Shawarma in the GTA . I grew up in Saudi so I have a pretty high standard when it comes to shawarma . Soooo good .<->1
Fabulous Monday might spaghetti and meatballs ! Good Chopped Italian salad too . Place was busy but we were served in a timely manner and our server was very efficient .<->1
We 've been waiting outside for almost an hour . Good looks good . Still waiting . Got here 12:00 pm , now It 's 01:00 pm on a Tuesday afternoonSo hungry !<->2
This is my favorite burrito place . I have been to all others and this place is amazing . Their hit sauce is hot and delicious . I love it .<->1
Quick friendly service with consistent food . I feel like the quality here is a lot better then other locations that I have been to . The drive through is pretty fast but the girl who works there is super nice !<->1
Tried it for the second time , such a better experience . There was one bartender , Shaun , who was getting crushed , and yet , was extremely cool and calm , explaining beers , etc . A much better experience . Thanks Fate for redeeming yourself .<->1
Another one of my favorite pizza places around Cleveland . I love their unique pizzas ( and their names ) along with a limited yet good beer selection .<->1
Had donuts and croissants from here for my daughters bridal shower . Excellent in tast , texture and price . Thanks<->1
Delicious food with great ambience . Waiters are attentive and courteous . Will definitely recommend this place .<->1
My red velvet wedding cake came from this shop and was the best thing I have tasted ever . It was a perfect end to a perfect day .<->1
So glad I found the crew from Lola 's ! ! Had the fried chicken , cabbage , jalapeño corn bread , hubby had the mac & cheese instead of the cabbage . Miss the location uptown but this location is quick to carry - out .<->1
Not good . Waitresses were n't friendly and the shrimp was n't cooked . No effort to rectify as well . Absolutely no concern on behalf of the restaurant .<->0
Really ! They refused to put my nachos on the side ! I do n't want it to be soggy when I 'm on the plane . The old lady was snappy , and they got a messy kitchen . This is inside terminal E .<->0
We went there for lunch and it was expensive for what you receive . However , the food was really quiete good and the restaurant was very well designed . Give it a try .<->2
My first time must 've been a random lucky night for me cuz the second time was MEH , and the last time I found some plastic piece in my food ! ! Sick for hours after , had to throw it all out . * gag *<->0
Good buy overrated . Most dishes end up tasting like rice vinegar and mirin . Not really worth the long lines in my opinion .<->2
Good food and the staff is pretty good too . Eating outside is great when the weather permits . The burrito bowl is excellent !<->2
Possibly my favorite restaurant in the Phoenix area . The tacos are delicious , and the coconut margarita is a highlight as well .<->1
Not a place for Asian people who knows what Japanese ramen taste is like . One of the worst ramen ever in my life ...<->0
Delicious ! ! ! Friendly staff . Great food . Try the mixed grill and the appetizer platter . Both great for sharing and to try lots of menu items .<->1
Acai smoothie and breakast spinach wrap - no complaints . The employees were cordial and service was timely . Just do n't exit onto Decatur during peak traffic hours - " small kine busy " .<->0
The sushi was okay , not much in selection . Do n't come here unless you LOVE cucumber in your rolls as well , seeing as they are in almost every single roll<->0
Rosati 's was extremely delicious . My boyfriend and I had a Chicago deep dish pizza which was amazing . The staff there is super friendly which is always a plus . I will definitely be back to try more menu options !<->1
Food was good , but the service was so - so and the music was so loud we could n't hear ourselves think let alone talk to each other . We asked them to turn the music down a little but they refused .<->0
Very good food , very friendly , best Chinese so far<->1
Delicious food , places is very neat and proper . They also have excellent food service 's . Definitely recommended to my relatives and friends .<->1
Excellent local butcher shop and deli . If you want quality come here ! I usually pick up a sandwich for lunch but on a shopping day their bacon and steak are superb .<->1
Meet friends here for lunch and hand a wonderful lunch . One of the nice things is that they gave us enough time to visit and dine without being pressured to either order or finish .<->1
The Carne Asada burrito was great ! Generous in size , will have more for later . The meat was very tender , salsa was tasty too . Since this was my first time here , we 're given a complimentary drink . Very nice staff .<->1
LOVE , LOVE the Spicy Korean Chicken ! ! Great quality + cheap food = a great meal :) . Next time I have to try the Loco Moco ...<->1
Java is solid but I thoroughly enjoy warm lentil soup . The multigrain toast was dripping in Buddha . # YUM<->1
This place is a rip off . Probably the worst Mucho in the city . So skimpy on toppings .<->0
Best chilli in Charlotte . Very killer . I always get a chilli burger but you ca n't go wrong with any other chilli options<->1
disgusting kitchen area , rude service and the food was barely edible . AVOID AVOID AVOID .<->0
Great tacos ! Very good service ! long waits during busy hours ! Go figure for such a popular place !<->1
Decent selection . Their sushi is good - but not great . There are definitely better places in Pickering to go . It 's a decent , convenient option for location and accomodations for large parties though .<->2
Large chicken was really really large and they cut it up for you . Very flavorful and came with a drink too for about $ 10 plus tax . Would recommend !<->1
This McDonalds both looks classy , and the employees seem to be upbeat and good at their jobs . I 've never had a poor experience here , and will continue to visit this location in the future .<->1
good pizza . would order Chicago stlye again<->1
Loved the burgers here ! I had the [ heart ] & Seoul * and it was so good . They also had $ 2 beers at the bar . Super friendly staff that makes you feel comfortable . Definitely going back here again .<->1
Really enjoyed the mature and rather fun atmosphere . The food and drinks created a pleasurable evening . Definitely bringing my husband next time .<->1
This is by far the best Starbucks in town . My friend lives there by and I always stop there on the way to her house . Best customer service ever !<->1
Always good SuperBeautys 2 , bleu smoothies , and the best rice pudding ever ! ! !<->1
Great experience . Everything was delicious ! You have to try the miso corn and popcorn ice cream ( not together ) . They are passionate about food and it shows .<->1
Loved the food here ! ! It is simple , trendy , and has amazing shakes . I could n't have asked for a more perfect place for lunch . Employees are friendly and easy going .<->1
Amazing Steaks , drinks and ambiance ! Music is kept at a decent volume level for comfortable dinning . Ca n't wait to come back and visit before we leave Canada ! Need to bring my son and his friends here for sure !<->1
One of my favorite healthier restaurants in the valley ! ! Great food , great atmosphere and nice waiters . I always have a great experience here ! I recommend trying the macro platter or spicy chicken pita<->1
Open fires and live music ! We stayed until the fire wood ran out . Just a great place to spend a cool Saturday night . Yes Amanda took care of us like it was her own place .<->1
Still the best place to get a Vanilla Chai Tea Latte ! !<->1
The free samples of cookies in the shop are delicious . The staff is super friendly and attentive . My kids were offered full sized cookies to try , different from the variety of samples . We will visit again .<->1
The italian food is great but a bit overpriced ! The servers are really awkward it seems they warm up to the locals . Nice atmosphere roght on the lake . Try the truffle pizza !<->1
Closed down . Not a surprise as it went downhill significantly after moving .<->1
New Panera Bread on our area , love this place . Thank you for coming to our neighborhood .<->1
Very good customer service . Only spent less than 40 for a bunch of food . Food was delicious ! Definitely will be coming back<->1
There was a hair in my French onion soup . And my salad was served to me completely dry with no dressing . Did n't get offered anything to reconcile this . Over priced and rude service .<->0
Average burgers ! Cheap prices ! Went today and it was happy hour so half price shakes and fries . Had the chocolate covered strawberry shake . Tasted amazing . Every time we come we 're never disappointed !<->1
Told them my order three times and they still asked what I wanted . Then laughed and talked crap because I could n't hear them . Very lazy and rude workers<->0
The tables are too close together . You are basically sitting with strangers at your table so its not enjoyable at all ca nt have a conversation . Food was okay .<->0
This is the best take out Chinese in the area . Food is always made perfectly and it 's not super greasy . Super fast delivery ... like 20 min .. plus the delivery driver in the evening is kinda cute .<->1
Tommy 's was amazing ! Service was great and the food was perfect ! Would eat here again without hesitation .<->1
Good food and great service . The food was good lots of options . They have a good selection of drinks and the waitress was great and funny .<->1
Great customer service , not stuffy , down to earth folks , and the best cheesecake south of NYC !<->1
Says they 're open until 12 am , went in at 11:04 pm and would n't serve us . Little ridiculous . Past 4 times have tried to order a panini and machine is still " not working " or was n't " set up " . Do n't go , not worth it .<->0
If you want the best service hit up JJ at the bar . Fast . Friendly . Flair . One of the best bartenders on the strip . Carlos and Charlie ' s has great drink specials . It 's a fun atmosphere .<->1
Cool place and everyone is nice and good service and the menu is on a iPad so that 's cool and the food is good and fresh . High recommend 10/10<->1
First time there today on national hot dog day . Really good dogs ... we had a Chicago and a Carolina . Hand cut fries were hot , crispy and delicious . Ca n't wait to try the pizza .<->1
Decadent , Delicious , Divine , and close by on Decatur ! they are experts at grilled cheese and sundaes ! # repeatcustomers<->1
Unlike the traditional hotpot . I love the soup and the house made secret dipping sauce . Really healthy and wo n't gain weight ! Love it<->1
Best korean fried chicken ever ! ! ! Very good service too . I will definitely come back . Pricing is a bit high but I think it 's worth it .<->1
Great casual place . Always good food with a good selection and wait staff . Good value for your money .<->1
Love love this place ! ! Their food and drinks were not only delicious but also healthy and wholesome . They have a great selection on the menu And they all sound delish ! We love coming here !<->1
I so love this place . The atmosphere is great , but most of all the staff is excellent ! Lord the food is the best , I feel in love with their sweet tea ! Thanks for caring about your customers .<->1
My hubby and i went to marios the other day and let me tell you ... the food is absolutely amazing ! ! The staff was very friendly ... altogether just simply amazing ! !<->1
My favorite place for grocery . Food items are always fresh , and priced reasonably . I love the bakery stuff and spices too . Nice and cooperative staff , clean and welcoming environment .<->1
Guacamole was very hard . Steak meat was dry . Probably one of the worst Mexican food I have ever had in my life . I would recommend this place for drinks only .<->0
Small , but delicious food . The vibe inside reminds me of Amy Ruth 's in Harlem , NY with all of the great art and photos . Also , great customer service . Recommend for sure .<->1
Might be the slowest service I ve ever encountered . Ordered 1 waffle sandwich . Still standing here 20 minutes later . Only one person ahead of me ...<->0
Upscale modern and amazing food . Great wine selection and the best ambiance for sexy dinner for two .<->1
We had delicious meals . A great place for fresh Vegan eating . Portions were plentiful and we took home plenty for another meal . We will eat there again . The staff were a big plus as well . Thanks .<->1
Good place for ribs especially during the all you can eat promotion . Recommend the kapow shrimp and generally all their meats . Very kid friendly environment and a good stop before or after a movie next door .<->2
Great service and one of the best sandwiches I 've ever had . The Bobbie is all the best things from the day after thanksgiving . There is a reason it was voted " Best sandwich in America " .<->1
I wish I could give 0 stars ... Got here @ 8 : 55 and the door was locked ... The sign says they close at 9 ... This has happened more than once ... Good thing TCBY is across the street ! ! !<->0
The crepe was delish . It was made and prepared not in a hurry so it really looks good as it tastes . Place was clean and gorgeous I took some pastries to go tooo and they were great<->1
Old fashion feeling with a good vibe . Everything looks amazing and the prices reasonable<->1
Love this place , hole in the wall restaurant with delicious food . I have yet to be disappointed with their food . On Fridays only , they have Fish Tacos , yum yum .. Prices are super cheap , good quality , burritos are huge ...<->1
Super yummy ! I can see why this place is so popular . I had the margarita pizza with garlic butter instead of tomato sauce , and it was the bomb ! ! Will definitely be back !<->1
Freshest , good quality fish in the neighbourhood with very good sushi rice . Maybe the best sushi takeout shop in the city .<->1
Wonderful diner with friendly owner / operator ready to greet and each guest . Prices are very reasonable and portions are generous . I recommend the scratch made chili with just the right amount of heat for me . Open for lunch and breakfast .<->1
Coffee was really good . Service could have been a bit better . Food was prompt and tasty . I would absolutely come back . The menu had a variety for breakfast and I want to try for lunch .<->1
I love Chinese food , and live a walk away , but stopped coming here . I feel like there are better options a short drive away<->0
This one of my favorite vegan place . I like ginger chicken with fried rice and I tried almost every time I came here . I highly recommend this place if you are vegan .<->1
By far my favorite burger joint ! Fresh ingredients . A touch of their personal flavor . Family operated and owned . The place is awesome ! O yea , they have tons of other yummy things on their menu . Pizza ! ! !<->1
Over priced and not any better than other Chinese places in the area .<->0
Excellent and beyond excellent . Super friendly , it 's like stopping in for lunch at Yiayia 's place .<->1
The management staff here are amazing . Most of the delivery drivers are really friendly and actually care . The food is great and the drivers are always on time or early . Love this pizza hut<->1
When i m going to osis kitchen i feel like i m home ! fresh tasty and hommy ... My fevorit dish is the shnitzel and the couscous w vegetable<->1
We order from this place all of the time . I 've had their Seafood Combo Tom Yum , the Sliced Beef Soup , the Beef Combo Soup , Fried Chicken Over Fried Rice , and now their Duck Soup . Everything is great .<->1
Fast service , reasonably priced and great tasting food ! I ordered the pizza fries for lunch , they were done in less than ten minutes and were absolutely amazing . They were worth every calorie ! Very clean atmosphere .<->1
Delicious as always ! Catherine was very helpful in the bakery section , will definitely be back soon !<->1
I always go here when I 'm close to downtown . This is also a must for when visitors are in town . The bacon jam , chicken sandwich , and burger are my favorites !<->1
On a day where every person is Irish in da'burgh , I was pleasantly surprised by how nice the bartenders were at the " Tequila bar " especially the rockin female bartender Caitlyn !<->1
Really like their pizzas ! Service was great at lunch . Enjoyed wings and was able to get our flavor sauces on the side .<->1
I do n't play golf may never ever pick up a golf club ! But I will tell you what , the atmosphere was great and OMG the grilled Sea Bass Sliders were the bomb !<->1
Do not visit this premises on tuesdays lol . Crowded .<->0
Not ordering from them again . Cheesesteak came soggy and garlic toast was burned and hard as a rock . Sorry , not ordering from them again .<->0
Great Sushi ! The service was just ok , drinks took forever to get refilled and asked for place settings twice before stealing them from another table .<->1
5 star moment when I called out hot and got to the window and you remake my drink anyway . Thanks for that .<->1
Completely overpriced . Paid over $ 8 for a smoothie ( the Rise and Shine ) that tastes like and has the same consistency as orange juice that I could 've spent $ 1 on . Also very small sizes & subpar customer service .<->0
Nice place good food but only 4 stars because the service was subpar . Our waiter seemed annoyed by something . Maybe we just caught him on a bad day . Would come back again though .<->1
Love this pizza ! ! ! My favorite place ! Garlic knots are amazing ! Owner is super friendly and lots of options for vegetarians .<->1
Awesome ! It was a great people watching spot ! ! The food was good .. It 's a flour base , I was confused when the server asked me about salt and pepper seasoning ... The portions were huge . Sharing is a good option<->1
LOVED this place ! I had bean burro enchilada style , my spouse had the fish tacos . Both were excellent . The service was great and the price complimented the food . Definitely will be back .<->1
6/1 / 14Previous comments still stand . One of the best managers around . Keep up the good work !<->1
Under new ownership , but same awesome coffee , tea , bagels , breakfast , brunch ... I will continue to go here ... way better service and food then McDonald 's next door , do n't waste your time at McDonald 's ... Go to OASIS BAGELS they rock ! ! !<->1
I love this place ! The food is great ! ! ! A lot of variety . The crab legs are the best . Great service .<->1
An absolute oasis in a sea of Vegas chaos . Great food and service along with a fantastic replication of a French brasserie . Now I wish they had locations in Southern California .<->1
The service and beer are great . The food is okay and a bit over - priced . I 've had better sandwiches in the Glendale area , but it is nice to sit out on a patio and have a cold beer .<->2
Great food . The salad is very different . Good customer service too . We are just visiting Scottsdale for business and someone referred this place to us .<->1
Try the lemon or caramel filled donut rings ! Delicious and surprisingly light for a donut . I 'll be back to try some more - like the Nutella filled donut !<->1
I 've been to the Lizard only once and while I agree the draft beer selection is thin , the prices are reasonable ( unlike prior ownership ) and my buddy & I both loved the Lavoosh .<->2
Decided to stop here because we where nextdoor at the medical center . This is just the kind of gem I love to find . We had a wonderful breakfast and the service was excellent .<->1
If you want to spend $ 15.00 for a 23 oz beer then this is the place for you . We were not impressed by the service or the prices<->0
The chicken was awesome . The steak was very good too . Plus the chip dip was yum ! These tacos remind me of the street tacos in Mexico . So good !<->1
The best chicken and waffle in Toronto and the best I have ever had . The staff is very friendly and excellent . The food is amazing . The location is very unique and nice . Ca n't wait to stop by again !<->1
Love this place love the serviceVery neat and cleanThe staff was super helpful with everythingLearned about the new reward cards which was awesomeI go about once a week Yummy<->1
The food here is exceptional service is great but I think for 42 $ they should have better cuts of meat<->2
Steak tartar is killer and an amazing wine list<->1
Really amazing ! ! My bf loved the tomo fries and ramen burger and the pork belly bao buns were phenomenal !<->1
Stopped by for a quick drink . Pursued the menu . Some interesting breakfast items that I will try when I am hungrier . The Bloody Mary 's were delicious . They close early so you need to get there before 3 pm .<->1
Great atmosphere , over priced for portion size , limited gluten free options.service mediocre .<->2
Everytime I go , I am reminded just how good the food is . Not to mention the quality is fantastic . If you have n't been , you are missing out .<->1
The food here is outstanding . Portions are big . The owners care for their customers like family . I always order the shrimp fried rice and it 's perfect every time !<->1
Fun , friendly atmosphere ! Servers were quick and attentive ! Food was pretty good ; Pizza was delicious . The only thing I would want more of , are bigger tables and a larger beer selection . Keep up the great work !<->1
A Korean owned ramen shop . Cute and convenient location , though the ramen soup lacked flavour and the meat portion was anemic at best . The search for decent ramen in Calgary continues ...<->0
The food is better than in Thailand itself , since I love to travel to Thailand . The music is good , the location is in central downtown , and the service is good .<->1
We always come here for authentic Italian cuisine . The food was great , and vegetarian friendly . The service was on spot as well . My favorite dishes were the chefs pizza and the chicken parmesean .<->1
Love the new addition to our center ! ! Santa 's Wrap is thrilled with our new neighbors ! Great food and service . Has a wonderful atmosphere , fun ! ! Must try !<->1
Best Green Chili Burrito 's in the state or maybe the USA . Esther and Ana are fantastic . Love this place , have been going here for years . I would give the Green Chili Burrito 's 10 stars if that was an option .<->1
What a farmer 's market should be ! ! Almost all booths sold something edible ... Very few of the silly craft booths like we see in Edmonton farmers markets . This is likely to become a habitual stop whenever we are in Cowtown !<->1
LOVE the subs ! The level of service at the Steele Creek location is by far the best . Employees are always friendly and I never have to wait too long for my sub whether it 's a slow or busy day .<->1
I like coming to this location , but today they were a bit sluggish and the veggie bar was messy as heck . It made me not want to choose my toppings . I m hoping it was just a one day thing .<->1
The service here is very friendly and the wings are delicious ! The ' 83 Margarita for $ 5 is delicious :)<->1
Their homemade banana bread is amazing ! Just the way mamma made it ~<->1
I like this place , I just find the meat a little dry and I 'm not willing to wait 20 mins for smoked meat<->1
Delicious grilled chicken , fresh tortillas , good sides and salsas ... decent prices and family specials as well . Good stuff ! !<->1
Update : I 'm giving this place 3 stars so far for the effort of trying to fix the problem , but still have n't tried the food yet ( again ) so I still ca n't update that issue . More update to come .<->2
some of the best cocktails in phoenix . food is delicious but not intimidating .<->1
Good quality and quantity ! The size the pancakes are larger than my hand ! Fresh fruits and a offer of free waffles to taste . Thank you<->1
This place is legend . Elias is a local personality who makes wraps , awesome apple cake , falafel , and you laugh when you order . More of a takeout place , but they do have some seating . Muffins are good too .<->1
Everything I had changed my life . Spring rolls , Tom Kia , Penang curry with chicken , sticky rice with mango ! ! ! Amazing !<->1
One of my go - to fast food neighborhood places . Old school drive in atmosphere , great burgers . Tasty fish and shrimp baskets , chicken fingers . Good fries . Fun , energetic staff . Recommended .<->1
Love their spicy chicken and noodles . Quick and convenient . Nice sized meals .<->1
I like it here ! Attentive bar staff ! Friendly people ! Food is good , only had one bad experience here where my bartender was trashed . But every other time has been absolutely fabulous !<->2
Best soft serve I 've ever had ! Try the Nutty Buddy if you like hot fudge and peanuts . You wo n't regret it !<->1
Best spot to eat in Ellis island . The meat is always very tender and juicy . The corn bread is sweet and fluffy . Service is always great . Our waitress check on us like 10 times while we ate . Great bbq spot .<->1
I had dinner here couple weeks ago with all my team members from work , party of 7 . Everything that we ordered was great and it 's like you ca n't go wrong with all the dishes .<->1
Went there for lunch yesterday . Discusting stench odor inside . Cooks cooking w / out gloves , andpicking food off floor . Rice was greasy and over salted . NEVER AGAIN !<->0
Moved here recently and must say a great place . I love it . Great organic veges and superb fresh fish with very friendly folks at the counter . Will be back<->1
5 Stars ! Hands down ! I ordered food from here on UberEats and each time I was highly impressed ! The empanadas and carne asada fries are to die for . I highly recommend it .<->1
Great burger place . Employees are great with huge smiles on their faces . They bring your food out and the shakes are amazing ! Try them .<->1
Excellent service , clean , very friendly . Manager obviously cares about the brand and how customers feel when they eat at the restaurant .<->1
I was just there and they locked the front door and not let anybody in . lol lil did they know we are bottle buyers and big spenders . Never again .<->0
Shrimp and grits ... nuf said !<->1
Yummy authentic pizza . Butter crust or the original both are delightful ! They do get busy so plan ahead when ordering to go or in the restaurant .<->1
Good service , tacos are big not your regular street tacos . Drinks are also good and pricing is fair .<->1
I 've just lost confidence in Yelp . Ordered for delivery . Arrived without chopsticks . Hot and Sour Soup looked weird . Crispy noodles were mushy . Kung Pao chicken was pretty weak at best . Will not order from Peking Express again .<->0
Great dim sum ! Perfect for lunch or dinner . Never any ' crunchy bits ' in their meat items . Service was attentive and polite .<->1
Always fun and helpful with cooking ideas ! Tasting parties are a blast ! ! ! Thanks Ladies -<->1
Fantastic food , we 'll be back . Atmosphere is ... Interesting . But they put their efforts into the food . Yum . Recommend the cheese garlic bread<->1
Wonderful for the entire meal . Cocktails delicious Moscow Mule and martini . The bacon and octopus were great . I loved the lamb sausage . The service was superior . Love the Illy coffee .<->1
Dinner places with Salad bars are always my top pick ! Great soup I loved how they had a selection of buns . The prime rib was melt in your mouth satisfying .<->1
Shake stack is very juicy and tender . Cinnamon dulce leche shake is smooth , rich and sweetness is just nice . Fries has an interesting taste with the red pepper !<->1
Very very nice ! I love the spicy chicken and the sweet sour soup . Excellent quality and reasonable price and I will definitely visit once more<->1
Not sure what everyone else has been drinking ... but easily the worst cappuccino I 've consumed . Tasted sour and burnt . Might have gotten a bad one but could n't even finish it .<->0
Why go here ? Their ramen is sour and their chicken wings are burnt plus their food is overall bad . Plus the staff did n't care about any of it . Not mad ... just disappointed . Think they bought their ratings ...<->0
Weird location but the food is great ! The setup is unique . Just a mishmash of art , tables , chairs . You can see right in the kitchen . Worth it 100 % .<->1
Called ahead . Promised a 10 min wait . Waiting an hour now with hungry kids . So far not impressed . And no one really seems to care .<->0
Just above average tacos . Food is good and service is fine . Other Mexican places in the area are just as good or better .<->1
We love this place . The food is so delicious . The managers always make sure their customers leave happy and pleased with the service . The family deals offered on Sunday 's are a great deal . I would definitely recommend wing heaven<->1
Fantastic place . Great food , great service . The jalapeño bean dip is the best around . Happy hour has some awesome deals . The Scottsdale location is better than the west side restaurant . But i may be biased .<->1
Now that there 's a Cafe Rio in my neighborhood , this may become a weekly habit very quickly , uh oh ! ! and I like their new Rewards program too ... I 'm really in trouble now !<->1
Best doughnuts ! ! ! Staff is always a so friendly , some already know what we order . Very fresh.they also make orders for cupcakes for special occasions . Burritos are always on point<->1
Cafe rio is definitely one of my comfort food ! It 's worth it for the price you pay . Salmon burrito enchilada style is the best ! ! !<->1
A favorite place to go when I 'm craving breakfast for dinner . The latkes are tasty ( not as good as mom 's but ... you know ) and the service is always friendly and helpful . I always grab some baked goods to go ( rugelach ! ! ) .<->1
Clean establishment , options are yum and prices are fair . Customer service is okay , but it 's all good because the food is delicious always ! !<->1
Bar staff was rude , the wait staff was great . Well priced and good . .. definitely not great . However , the value puts it in my top 10 for a quick eat .<->2
Very Good ! Super close to my office and service was great and fast . The side salad is like a whole other meal . Looks like I will definitely be a repeat customer .<->1
Skinny Margarita , shrimp taco , mushroom taco ! ! Gluten friendly . Waitress was very nice , efficient Share your tacos and you get 4 with no extra charge .<->1
First kinton ramen location in sauga ! The same quality as you would get downtown . Delicious but there 's still a line up . I would say it 's a much bigger location than other branches though .<->1
I love their bread . I normally buy the Cheddar Cheese and Sour Dough . I have not eaten at this location but I have at their other store . Loved their Pastrami sandwich .<->1
The food here is quite delicious . Everything is fresh and flavorful and very well priced . Drive thru is an added plus .<->1
If the delivery truck flipped in the interstate , I 'd eat my meal right off the pavement , in traffic . It 's that good . The burnt ends are amazing . The hamburger is made of God cows .<->1
Jalapeño mac and cheese & Street tacos were delicious ! Was n't expecting to be that impressed . Def come for happy hour :)<->1
great bar , great jazz , I appreciate the attention to detail ... tasteful design ... nice atmosphere . Wide selection of tequilas ... and fine Djangoish ( ok , not a word ) swing jazz with a voice on the weekends .<->1
Another great breakfast place . The Huevo Rancheros was great ! You get a ton of food and a ton of meat . This place never disappoints .<->1
I 've never had a bad dish from Tolteca ! Portions are huge , but the prices are small . Save room on the way out because their bakery is top notch !<->1
Worst bar in Vegas ! ! Carrie is a supreme idiot ! The other bartender too , ugliest mug ca nt miss him , slower then a turtle on standby !<->0
Had the seafood omelette , it was great . Sat at the diner and the waitress was very friendly & nice . Refilled my coffee promptly . I would definitely return for breakfast again .<->1
Food was eh and the servers were rude . Went with my boyfriend and the waitress assumed we were n't together and brought out 2 checks ... that was a first .<->0
Great water store ! Get their gift card - your water refill will be INSANELY cheap ! Their treats are delicious - I especially love the fruit cocktail with chili and chamoy . The staff is also very friendly and helpful .<->1
The only bad thing I could find wrong with this place is that is n't open 24 hours everyday . They are so hospitable and amazing . Keep up the work late night workers of krispy kreme .<->1
Awesome food and great service ! Andrea our hostess and our server Tara were amazing . Recommend the pork belly buns ! ! Highly recommend it .<->1
Excellent pizza . Excellent service . Excellent ambiance . If you have a little leisure time - and it 's not too hot out - sit on the patio . You may even find a little bit of romance there .<->1
Great food and service ! Nice friendly atmosphere . Was Bravi Resturant prior and it was ok , like Stella 59 better . It seems to be under rated for the food quality , try the fettuccine with shrimp and blue cheese crumbles added .<->1
Great place to watch the game . Wonderful local atmosphere . Steeler Nation is in full effect .<->1
On Google this restaurant is listed as teppanyaki style . The location on Indian Bend in Scottsdale has nothing of the sort . My kids were very disappointed .<->0
My first trip here , very clean and I love the aluminum chairs ! The food was hot and fresh and I love their special sauce too . TOAST !<->1
One of my favorite breakfast places when i come to toronto - drive out of my way to get there .<->1
WowDelicious food . Great place . Very clean Resturant and staff . Waiter named OMAr is very smart and helpful more than you think .<->1
Awesome chai tea Lattes and the turkey sandwich is the best one in town ... The staff is always friendly and they remember our names ! !<->1
Cool server . The place was full of Scottsdale douchbags and way to over priced hints all the douchbags . Hey if douchbags is your thing then this is the place for you .<->0
Food was interesting and delicious . Service was quick and waitress was on point .<->1
All good till they ran out on Limón at 9 pm on a Saturday ? ? ? Like wtf ? ? ? I 'm a mutha fucking foooodiean ! ! !<->2
Relaxed atmosphere , great roasted coffee , cool artsy design and super friendly staff . This is now my favorite place in Vegas !<->1
Quick , Easy , amazingly priced food . Quality of food and the service is what keeps me coming every single week ! Love this place !<->1
Great ambience . The events are fun with talented entertainment ! Amazing , fresh food from an eclectic chef . Check this up and coming restaurant out !<->1
fatty meat low quality with inflated prices . this place has went down substantially<->0
Great place for bar food . Good draft list and my veggie hot dog was pretty tasty . The fries were excellent . The place is very casual and pretty crowded on the weekends .<->1
Visiting Las Vegas for the first time and my friend wanted to take me here . Ordered the Peach Nana with boba . Very yummy ! Quick , clean and friendly ! Wish we had these back home .<->1
Excellent sushi , very nice and cozy little place . Cool well informed hosts . Highly recommended<->1
Cheese is slightly expensive here , but you can be sure you 'll be getting good cheese . Staff is very knowledgeable and friendly . This is the place I go to for cheese in Kensington market .<->1
Omg ! Amazing . I ate things I normally did n't like . When you make a reservation , Ask ... no demand Tiger . He 's awesome ! ! ! Eat here !<->1
Jersey Mike 's is always great , but it has to be Mike Style . It has n't changed since I was in high school . It 's always quality and always great you can never go wrong with Jersey Mike 's .<->1
This place is the best Chinese on the northwest side of town ... People friendly and the food is great ... I recommend the chicken lettuce wraps ... And Chinese fried donuts for desert<->1
First time at this establishment excellent food especially the beef brisket . Prices for not bad for the amount of food you get . We did the smaller platter for the two of us and ended up bringing some home<->1
Excellent . Schwarma is excellent ! Grape leaves , hummus and taboullah were also outstanding . Service was excellent . Meat is Halal .<->1
Was hoping this food was amazing but sadly food has no flavor what so ever ! Pricing was ok but would never come back .<->0
Horrible . Pizza was cold and late ( took almost 2 hours ) and the fries were soggy . STAY AWAY ! ! !<->0
very good cake with a variety of flavours to choose from , we got the caramel and flower salt one and it is quite delicious and not too sweet , liked the sponginess of the cake part .<->1
Wow . All I have to say is wow . Came here for an event and thy were above and beyond . Delicious food , amazing service . Great location . Definitely come here .<->1
Went there twice with the family . Had a great experience at this place . The service was amazing . Food was amazing . Would go back here .<->1
LOVE THIS PLACE ! it may be a little hole in the wall with tacky decor but its awesome . :)<->1
Just had a glass of wine and a beer but , we 'll be back here - great atmosphere and service is supuerb !<->1
This place was great . Good food , great mix of Items . The entertainment is great . Perfect place to start a night out or stay all night<->1
Its a good japanese restuarant . It is not a sushi bar . It only provides sushi rolls and sashami . Its Good but not great . It is run by Japanese staff . Which is a sign of quality .<->2
It might be a chain restaurant but oh so good . This is a place you have to check out . I 'm sorry I do n't live in Tempe so I ca n't eat here more often .<->1
Oh , Luv It 's how I love you . Your crunch is the best . Mmmm , why did we move so far from you ?<->1
Horrible Service , Low quality sushi , overall dirty restaurant . Will not go back even if it was free ! I found a hair in my dynamite roll !<->0
I understand they no longer cook the sweet potato fries ... Big mistake ! Still going here but disappointed !<->0
Simple mom and pop restaurant with unique Spanish sodas . Quick and kind staff . Beautiful outdoor patio with flowers . The food itself was okay . Too much sauce on the taco bowl salad - but the flavor itself was good .<->2
Second time eating here . Food is good , but the service is just awful . 8 tables with 7 wait staff and still the service made a Burger King employee seem overly willing to help .<->0
Pros : Good foodWide selection of foodWaiters know Canto & MandarinCons : Bad service ( slow , loud , inconsiderate ) Does n't properly wash & dry dishesLoud dish cleaning ( so loud that I cringed and feared for the safety of my eardrums ) Replies using Canto ( I do n't understand Canto ) LONG WAIT FOR FOOD<->0
Recently got dinner to go from this location . The order was perfect , and the food was still hot when we got it home . I will definitely come back to this location in the future .<->2
I vacationed here in Vegas and this park was n't what I 'd expect in Vegas . So cool and unexpected . The ambience and energy was awesome ! There are some cute boutiques and eateries . Great experience for sure !<->1
Low key atmosphere with great draught beer and whiskey selection .<->1
Love everything about this place ! The food is awesome , the cornbread is wonderful , and the ice tea is fresh brewed . My wife loves the carrots and the green beans remind me of those family Sunday dinners back home .<->1
This place is legit ! Food tastes great . You get plenty of food . There is plenty of room . All at affordable prices . This people know what they are doing and it is great ! They could get some larger water glasses though .<->1
Service - 5 starFried ravioli - unique . Cheesy . 5 starChianti - 5 starMarguerite DOC - 5 starsFiletti - 5 stars . This place is as good as Serious Pie in Seattle ! ! ' If it 's good enough for Guy it 's good enough for me ...<->1
Best coffee and staff are always so friendly . Drip and espresso drinks are great . Dirt and worms hot chocolate comes with gummy worm - kids love It !<->1
Great food . Loved the fried chicken benedict and the red velvet pancakes . Everyone else seemed to enjoy their food also . I would definitely come here again .<->1
Great Greek cuisine . The gyros are great . Both chicken n pork souvlaki is excellent . The service n good<->1
Delicious chocolates . I had a buckeye and we also ordered turtles . Their ' to die fors ' and lady locks looked amazing . They also made cheesecakes . Service was very friendly and helpful . We were informed chocolates were made in sharpsburg<->1
The food was good , the atmoshere was great . If the waiter would have been more interested I would have at least gave a 4 star .<->2
Delish ! Great drink specials , delicious tacos and great service ! Definitely will be back ! Try the fish tempura and fajita beef tacos . Yum !<->1
Typical diner atmosphere , except there is SINGING ! The wait staff take turns singing . Unusual , uncomfortable and entertaining all at the same time . Portions were large and tasty . A bit pricy but , hey , that 's Vegas .<->2
Lovely food , friendly service ... that explains why it is crowded<->1
My go to place for chinese food . It is family owned . They have some of the best fried rice ! It is better than most take out places in charlotte .<->1
The curry pork cutlet was ok , not enough sauce . The desert my gf had was horrible ... the browny was really small , with hot matcha where i can hardly taste any matcha . and it was 8.99 ...<->0
Nice view of the fountain BUT terrible food and service . Go just for the view from the patio . Not worth it .<->0
They have really good food . It 's delicious and good customer service . We all had a lot of fun . Good place to hangout .<->1
Great little place great prices its been here for Years , great hot dogs you ca n't beat this place<->1
Best place for breakfast lunch or dinner . Bring you appetite because they have large portions of great food .<->1
Great dining experience in Montreal ! Our server Gael made excellent recommendations for menu choices and everything we ordered was very well prepared and presented . All of wait staff is very attentive . Glad we picked Maggie Oakes for dinner .<->1
I LOVE this place ! The chai tea is better than Starbucks ! ! The girls here are always super friendly and try to remember their customers ! Give it a try you will love it !<->1
I love it ! Good curry and great buffet price . Tandoori pollo is awesome . The place is very nice .<->1
Absoutely love this place ! Best pollo fundido around and I always enjoy their Mango Margarita 's . They never disappoint<->1
Found this through groupon . Great happy hour specials .. huge burgers .. all around tasty food . We definitely will be back ! It was worth the half hour drive !<->1
Worst quality everThe only reason why they are still open it because of their community present close to the restaurant<->0
Looks like it is permanently closed . I went on 6/6 / 18 at 12:30 , and both the trailer and store look abandoned . There 's nothing left in the trailer , the outside looks really dirty , and nobody was around at all .<->2
If you go to hard rock live . Do n't eat and run the whole way their so you only weigh no more then 100 pounds . The seats are so close and small you ca n't get comfortable .<->0
I 'm giving these girls a big thumbs up ! Great burrito bowls & tacos . Beef was soooo tasty .<->1
The best falafel I 've had in Toronto . It has a wonderful crusty exterior and soft inside . Nicely seasoned . The woman running the place is also incredibly friendly and hardworking . And for the price , it ca n't be beat .<->1
Remind me why I revisited this place again after many years ? Oh yeah ! It must be so that I can briefly say , " Meh . I 've experienced better "<->0
This place is seriously legitimate . $ 4 Craft beers ! Shuffleboard ! Outside Patio with Beer PongShrimp and Grits that you will die overCool atmosphere ! Downtown summerlin ! This place HAS IT ALL !<->1
Great fried egg , cheese , tomato and sausage for $ 6 plus a great macchiato and not overly sweet cinnamon roll . You 've got ta go . Seems like a place that would be in SF or NYC . And that 's a good thing .<->1
They have the best white pizza around and nothing has changed , the food , the people or the decor in over twenty years ! That 's a good thing , a must have Friday night dinner pizza place !<->1
Best Pizza Delivery I 've had in Toronto . A little more expensive if you like to pimp out your pizza like I do but totally worth it .<->1
Wonderful pizza at good prices . Ask for current specials . Yummy pizza varieties , especially the chicken bacon ranch . Monona Italian delivers deliciousness once again !<->1
Went back on my own to try again . Have to say I still find the smoke to be overpowering on the meat . Service was great . Portions were large . Better experience , however it 's not my kind of BBQ .<->2
great place confortable and relax , but the music is too LOUUUUDDDD<->1
I expected more because of the way people amp this place up but the dogs are n't that good to me . They 're ok . Homemade chili cheese dogs taste better . Just my opinion though , you may think otherwise .<->0
Humongous , yummy pizza . Though they did have a little wait on the night we visited , the tasty pizza compensated for it . One large three topping pizza with mushrooms , green peppers and mozzarella made my day !<->1
Service was satisfactory . While steak was good , it certainly was not cooked to an internal temperature of 160 ° F as requested . Pork chop was inedible , way too salty , was removed from bill without requesting . Prices were reasonable .<->2
LOVE this place . Great food , and likely the best service in town . One of the last " old school " steakhouses in Vegas . Do n't let the outside fool you , it is definitely worth a visit .<->1
We went to Cody 's on Friday for lunch I had the fish and is was fantastic , we loved the service with a smile attitude as well.you walk away feeling full and appreciated .<->1
My cousin plays on a pool league every week and that is enjoyable . Not the best service but I was impressed by the quality and amount of food !<->2
Love this place , the food is fresh , ambient atmosphere , professional stuff , you need to try this place<->1
Great coffee and downtown atmosphere . I was also able to order a latte that was Paleo ... that 's hard to find . Way to go Peixoto !<->1
Nice little hot dog shop in the middle of Midnapore . Lots of variety , great fresh cut fries , and convenient .<->1
The service was decent for dinner on a Saturday night , the food was quite well and definitely affordable .<->1
Not enough words to write a review for The Palm . Just one of the best steak houses in North America . Sign up for the 837 Club . Accumulate enough points to get your portrait painted on the wall .<->1
Awful service and the meat was raw . Never coming here again .<->0
Walked in expecting greatness ... Smelled rancid oil as soon as I opened the door , then walked away . Clean it up Bobby !<->0
Solid club . Good crowd and great DJ . Drinks are fairly expensive but no more than any other Vegas club .<->1
I have tried to call Sal 's a few times and they area always " closing " or wo n't deliver a few miles away . If you are close and it is dinner time , great . If not , do n't bother .<->0
This place has three locations now . This is hands down the best Mexican food in Vegas . Reasonably priced as well . The habanero salsa is my personal favorite .<->1
So so happy to have a place to have some good falafel . The spicy is actually spicy . The falafel balls were made fresh and light , the way they are supposed to be . Left here happy and thinking about coming back .<->1
I was not crazy about the burger I got ( 3 mini cheeseburgers ) but I do love their pickle fries ! ! ! I never liked pickles until now !<->2
I love this Restaurant for two reasons ... I get to eat my favorite dish on their menu which is Polpo E Fragola Al Nero and at the same time enjoy the Bellagio water fountain show ... :)<->1
Enjoyed this place . It has a good , hipster type , atmosphere . They have really good food and the drinks were delicious . Our service was also great .. I will return !<->1
What a great place ! Discovered an unexpected culinary treat and a healthy economical choice to boot .<->1
Amazing . A fantastic chicken parm sandwich - well cooked , great sauce , soft bun . Great recommendations by the owner . I 'll be back .<->1
I like this place when we are a large group , the waiters are professional and friendly , the portion of food is large , and it 's byow !<->1
Food is really bad .. Quantity is very less . Very less options . On top of it , wayyyyyyyyyy pricy . Waiters wo n't even smile . If I had a chance to go back in time , I will change my decision to eat here .<->0
Great customer service and good food ! Great prices before the Suns game . Wish I had taken pics , ate it too fast . Had Reuben with pastrami , chili fries and grilled cheese for my kids . Yes they have kids meals !<->1
food is delicious . service sucks . trendy atmosphere . a little pricey .<->2
Our server Robert was outstanding ! Sit outside ! The view and food were fabulous ! ! The Oscar Benedict was perfect so were the drinks ! Def coming back !<->1
Food was excellent and worth the l - o - n - g wait . There was only one chef in the kitchen and two staff members . I would definitely eat here again but I would suggest they hire another chef or just more help in general .<->1
Charges an unnecessary 4.7 % CNF tax . Did n't even know about it until I got home from my trip and looked at my receipt .<->0
Awesome wings and their Happy Hour prices and selections are great . Highly recommend the Zipp 's at 211 Warner Rd . , Gilbert !<->1
Ordered the Sweet & Sour Spare ribs for $ 9.95 - portions is good for 2 - people ! Delicious !<->1
Very average and expensive . Disappointing . My wife got a dry steak with nothing on it . My prime rib was good . All and all below expectations .<->2
Never again ! My kids love to visit Sprinkles on our regular Scottsdale shopping trips . We visited for my son 's birthday and the young teenage employees were incredibly rude . Thanks for ruining his birthday treat , ladies . Definitely wo n't be back .<->0
Worst customer service ! ! ! Never going back there . The lady at the cash register was so rude .<->0
Real imagination and creativity . Love the Peche Mortel .<->1
So happy they are here in Vegas . Great food , excellent service , and the atmosphere is so fun . Had to stop in the general store , too .<->1
Must stop when in Madison . Awesome local beer selection and of course the best Old Fashions Iv ever had . The thing to order is the Old Fashioned Burger with one if their many drink selections .<->1
This is THE SLOWEST Wendy 's I have ever seen . The workers seem clueless and food quality has seriously deteriorated .<->0
Good food , great environment . Really smart addition to south side works . Really like that it 's right on the river as well .<->1
Probably one of the most underrated restaurants in Charlotte . Their gelato is amazing , as are almost all of the entrees . My favorite is the Cubano panini . Great staff , kid friendly , great kids menu .<->1
Love their mixed berry smoothie ! It 's so light and not that sweet so expect a refresher ! A regular size is enough to carry you over till the next meal .<->1
So freaking GOOD ! ! ! The cronuts are to die for ! Staff are friendly , clean shop and delicious donuts . If you 've never tried a cronut you need to get yourself here ASAP !<->1
Yesterday I had the Salmon Panang Curry again . It is just the best Curry one could imagine . So delicious . Love this restaurant !<->1
Manager went above and beyond to help us . The food is good and atmosphere is nice . Kristin & Jeff<->1
Just been here a few times but the people are awesome no attitude try to answer all your questions and serving sizes are very large and the prices are pretty cheap<->1
Amazing ambiance and food , one the best restaurants I 've ever been to all over the world .<->1
Absolutely the Best Sauce and sausage ! The ingredients are always fresh ! Our family has been eating Bruno 's Pizza for over 30 years - we were excited to see them open a location in Las Vegas ! !<->1
Every time I 've gotten takeout here , I 've been pleased . Food is cooked in front of you . Extremely casual . Delicious pitas . I 've had gyros here , but my favorite is the Athenian Platter . So good .<->1
Wonderful service , atmosphere welcoming and beautiful with many Irish items displayed , and great food . What a treat !<->1
My BF and I come here a lot as they have vegan food and are happy to accommodate my picky needs . Chuck and Fire behind the bar are always friendly and pour a tasty drink !<->1
Love it . Love the fondue . I have n't had anything here I do n't like . The service is great too .<->1
Knocking off a star because of the pricey range fees and food / drink items . Otherwise , a fun place to hang out , play , eat , and drink . HINT : go between 9a - 12p and save on range fees .<->1
The best fried chicken on the planet ! The cheese tornado potatoes are great too ! A must try .<->1
This is really Italian - always the freshest of ingredients used - great deli and store tooA DDD stop that really is awesome !<->1
Should have checked before leaving but I ordered a 20 pc nuggets for a few of us and instead they packed two McChicken sandwiches . The receipt clearly stated chicken nuggets . Maybe their employees ca n't read ?<->0
The food was not only tasty and fresh but the service was absolutely delightful . I have been to a few buffets here in Vegas and this one 's value and quality rivals none ...<->1
This place is worth the lunch rush , the line always moves quickly & you ca n't beat the food . I 've ordered the street tacos & El mariachi burrito enchilada style . Love the Jamaica .<->1
I love this place . Great food , friendly people and super fast service . Best tzatziki sauce around !<->1
Great atmosphere , great pizza ! Great place if you want a good pizza downtown . Kinda busy though ...<->1
This is truly my favorite pizza restaurant . The pizza is on the light side . You do n't feel stuffed in pizza . Its quiet enough to enjoy a conversation . The president ordered from here when he was in town .<->1
