Love sushi so I decided to try this place out . Sad to say it was definitely disappointing and a waste of money . Yuck .<->0
This is our neighborhood go to for a quick meal . The hot dogs and fries are my go to and breakfast is always good . The staff make you feel like family .<->1
3rd time in 3 years when I visit vegas . Always great food and decent service . Dj and dancing Friday nights on the patio<->1
Too much $ $ for okay food . The beer options are amazing but the prices are ridiculous .<->0
It 's time to update your online menu . The price of your cheesesteaks has gone up by 38 % since you posted your menu .<->0
Exceptional service with a relaxed vibe in order to let the food do the talking . Looking forward to our next visit to try the frog legs !<->1
I m from San Diego and here in Phoenix . One of our clients recommend this . We find the staff very friendly . The food and price are great .<->1
Have been going to Pine Garden for years . The food is great but I wish they would do some updating in the place , it is definitely apparent that is run down . But no problems with the food !<->2
Beer is okay . Food is absolutely phenomenal ! Green curry mussels , fried cheese curds , & fish tacos . Their brandy old fashioned was also delicious . A great place to grab food / drinks and watch the game .<->1
Overall dinner was good until I received the bill a was charged for ice . $ 350 dinner and your billing me $ 2 per drink for ice . Never coming back what a joke !<->0
Hi Greetings An Blessings . The Atmosphere , Culinary Skills , & Ambience Was Great . ! :) The Shrimp & Grits , Red Velvet Waffles & Chicken Was Delicious , Plus The Fried Green Tomatoes Were Awesome . ! South Park Site Was Great . ;)<->1
The service was extremely slow , and the food seemed to be overpriced for what it was . The food itself was neither amazing nor inedible .<->2
Sushi was amazing ! ! We got a couple of rolls , but the hot springs roll is definitely the best ! Everything tasted so fresh . Definitely recommend !<->1
This is the closest Food place next to my office and I am never disappointed in the fare i get from here . They have all the classic Mexican flavor I 'm looking for and it 's a classic spot !<->1
Was my usual place for fish and chips because it 's close and well was good but the last few times I 've gone in the food has been disappointing .<->2
Top notch stuff here - I highly recommend it ! The staff is knowledgeable on allergies as well !<->1
Inexpensive , great menu , friendly attentive service , and they have Kingfisher . What more can you ask for ? Get the lamb naan .<->1
Even Wasabi sushi is better in their quality . Kinjo went down sometimes from the time Peter Kinjo was there .<->0
Great little taco place ! If you 're in NODA , definitely check it out . The nachos are highly recommended ! !<->1
I really love the location and ambiance here . It 's so Arizona to have a gem like this tucked away in a Flippin strip mall . Food is very good . Service is on point and the tequila is bountiful .<->1
Go for the combo deal ! It is worth the money . Always a good time at D & B ! Food and service is great and of course love to play the games !<->1
Food was great and inexpensive ... Customer service was awesome ... I ca n't wait for my next trip back to Charlotte<->1
Excellent gluten free menu and service . Had a wonderful celebration lunch here while visiting my parents . Something on the menu for everyone .<->1
Simple clean decor , complex tasting ramen , great service and specials . Also free wifi .<->1
Awesome crepesAwesome views out panoramic windowsAwesome coffeeAwesome beerAwesome location ( I mean , relatively - maybe convenient is the better word ) Awesomely helpful staffAwesomely small deliberate kitchen spaceAwesome postersAwesome place<->1
Yummy . Delicious . Loved the meal ! Loved the staff . It 's officially my new standard for local authentic Mexican food , here in Mesa AZ . I shall definitely return for more !<->1
I have been going to Sprouts for years . The freshest locally grown produce at awesome prices . Blue chips are a smokin deal when on sale and so is the kefir . Very helpful staff too .<->1
Total bad meal , did not bake cheese on shell , meat cold , wrong cheese on top , no cilantro . , no dressing . NO bueno .<->0
Ugh ordered a spicy salmon handroll and they gave me a handroll with only rice and tempura bits . Service was slow . Food kinda sucks .<->0
2nd time going for happy hour and it was amazing again ! I highly suggest getting the pomegrante cosmo , awesome !<->1
Just bought a Liquid Breaking Bad from this place and it is strong and amazing . The atmosphere is nice and the lady who made my coffee and checked me out was very pleasant and welcoming .<->1
Awesome ! ! ! The food and the waiter . Other than the crazy NC law that meant I could n't have a brunch mimosa this is one of the greatest brunches I have ever hat !<->1
I 'm giving them a 5 just for their spaghetti and meatball calzone . It sounds awful , but it is one of the best things I 've ever eaten . Must try ! !<->1
Bought our new flat panel TV here during an after Christmas sale . Was n't the most smoking deal in the world , but saved us about 50 bucks on similar models we looked at elsewhere .<->1
I love this place ! The food is really good and the service is great . The La Boca pizza is one of my favorites and the bruschetta planks are AWESOME .<->1
Best Outback I 've ever been to and I 've gone all over the US . The service is phenomenal ass is the food . Love the atmosphere does n't feel like a typical Outback ! No worries Wednesday gets me every week<->1
Could be better , could be worse . The ramen is average , but affordable . The best things about this place are the appetizers . The salad , the curry , and the karaage are the standouts .<->0
Great service , quality , and price ! Will definitely be back ! We tried the carnitas plate and Barbacoa burrito . Both were delicious .<->1
Very fast service with healthy portions of fish and chips . The price is right on this one and the people working there are very nice . I hope this one stays in the neighbourhood !<->1
Love Nick 's . Food is great , portions are large and very filling . Service staff always friendly .<->1
Had my birthday dinner here . Omg awesome stuffed shrimp with crab . Nice elegant place ! ! Friendly staff . Wait time was good .<->1
First time here . Craig was an excellent server ! My first taste of Chicago pizza ! Great ambiance and company !<->1
Amazingly slow and inefficient . They ran out of cooked chicken . So then halted the entire line -- including people who were not ordering chicken . The management here should be fired twice .<->0
Kinda hard to find , but it 's inside the main building in the Chinatown mall / plaza . The boba is pretty soft . Milk tea with boba is decent , 3.5 / 5 . The price is average .<->2
Ordered twenty shrimps . Got nineteen shrimps instead ! ! ! I am outrage . Green beans all over the floor . Bathrooms smell like the Axe body spray . I will never bring my pet parakeet here AGaain . UGH ! ! !<->2
Mi Patio is a great place for a quick meal or happy hour with your friends . Inexpensive , quick , consistent . You ca n't go wrong with a meal here .<->1
I love this place , until I had to get a full patdown and biometric face scan to get in . Never going back .<->0
My rating is based on food alone . The Ramen is awesome ! I only wish they had hot tea and maybe juice for kids . But the service was good . We will be back for sure !<->1
Ate here last week , and the food is great . The menu is a little more creative than some of your standard Chinese restaurants which is refreshing to see . Service was pleasant , quick and efficient . definitely be back !<->1
Great food . Always the only ones in the dining room but it 's more of a carry out pizza place . Love the service and food<->1
If they could just turn the outdoor music off at 1 am , that would be great . There is no one outside because it is too cold . Speakers are too loud . It 's a restaurant , not a club .<->0
I used to like the food in this restaurant until i ordered takeout today . There 's a piece of garbage like plastic bag in the noodle i ordered today . This is seriously disgusting .<->0
Worst waitress I have ever seen in my whole life , went home and told my grandpa the story , he said " worst waitress I have ever heard of in my whole life ! "<->0
Great place to sit ( on the patio ) and enjoy coffee / gelato with someone , intimately - - if the weather permits . Really pleasant place to chill ; music is good to boot !<->1
Came by for the third time , even better than last time . Chris , the manager , even said that there are better things to come<->1
Slowest drive through time ever ! always messes my order up :( and they over cook the chocolate chip cookie so it 's hard and the Nutella croissant barely has anything in it ! !<->2
Great spot for lunch , fast , clean , delicious Korean food ! My boyfriend and I almost come here every day . Beef bibimbap and unagi bowl are always my choices .<->1
This is by far my favorite Indian restaurant in the area . I 've been there many times and have never been disappointed . It 's sometimes difficult to get a table but it 's Definitely is worth the wait<->1
My Favorite place to get Pho , their soups are the standard in which I set the bar to all other Pho Joints<->1
I love this place . The coffee , the people , the atmosphere and the cats . Colony Cafe is now my go to place for coffee . Who wants to meet me there tomorrow at 11 am and play with the cats ?<->1
if this rating was only for food it would be 5 stars , however wait times tend to drag and you have to be careful you do n't catch Maria on an off day<->1
This place is a great post game stop for Badger fans . Love it here ! Great dive bar atmosphere was great food and super cold fresh beer . Highly recommend !<->1
BEST BREAKFAST EVER ! ! ! This is a cool old family diner that serves an awesome breakfast . French toast was perfection and the super beauty breakfast was amazing .<->1
My go to Pho place in Ballantyne ! The broth is amazing and the food is delicious . You wo n't be disappointed !<->1
Worst half - assed imitation of a poorly run buffalo wild wings I 've ever seen . Terrible service and idiot hostess made sure no return trips will ever happen . Pathetic .<->0
Franco is excellent server . He was the awesome by doing the following : quick / friendly / extremely pleasant and He also provided me with excellent food . I will go to this restaurant always with employees like him . Very happy loyal customer since 2005 Excellent<->1
Highlights : delicious mimosa that magically filled itself , KING CRAB LEGS ! , all sorts of salads , anchovies , smoked salmon , tiramisu cup , apple candy ... um yeah , I ate a lot :D<->1
Always a fan of this place ! Love the bread & butter while waiting . Great flavored ice teas . No longer sell the BLT pizza which I totally loved , need to find a new fav now .<->1
love it so much . I will come back this restaurant again if I come to Las Vegas once again<->1
This place is amazing . I 've eaten there every week since discovering the hidden gem :)<->1
Good stuff . The best chips and salsa . Great cheese dip too . The double steak and chicken quesadilla is fantastic .<->1
good service , the menu is hard to read the pictures do nt match the menu ! . place looks clean , service is great !<->1
Take - out joint . Curries are good . Dhal puri and roti are good . Put them together and it is quite an amazing meal here . I ca n't rate on service or decor , as service is pretty non - existent . 3/5 for food<->2
Went back to Vegas for a visit . Had the chicken and waffles again . Love them ! ! ! Best chicken ever ! Will go there time and time again , oh wait I have . I proudly wear the black HH t - shirt .<->1
This place is a joke . Sat at the empty bar on a Saturday night ... the food was horrible , the service was horrible ... this place will not be around for long<->0
Had an amazing experience last night , lovely atmosphere , food and staff ! The bone marrow escargot was our absolute favourite and cheeses were out of this world . I would definitely recommend !<->1
The sprite here is pretty good . It had the appropriate amount of lemon flavor . The only thing lacking was the amount of spice in the sprite . It only had an " after - taste spice . " Overall , good sprite .<->2
Never disappoints ! The food is always on point . The staff is so great ! Arlena and Celeste make it feel like home . They are the sweetest women ! We will keep coming back !<->1
Pretty good , clean restaurant fresh ingredients . Onion rings was on point . Good customer service and they give you extra ranch at no cost .<->1
Delightful and always consistent . Food is delicious , restaurant is beautiful ( the patio in the summer is key ) , staff are attentive . They only source and feature Italian wines so that can be limiting if you do n't love them .<->1
Did a family style dinner for a wedding rehearsal . Not well designed but had a good time . Wait staff seemed a bit over whelmed . Will need to try a regular dinner to judge better .<->2
One of wife and I ' s favorite places to have fun . Karaoke on thursday and sat and food specials .. And tastey also ! Biker friendly bar and staff always makes you feel welcome<->1
Thanks Janet for the great customer service . True asset to the company and thanks for keeping our wine glasses full !<->1
This place is like a Subway restaurant for pizza . The store is very warm , even in winter months . I felt the toppings were limited and did n't look too fresh . Over all , tasty pizza .<->2
Not at good as ' Taste of China Seafood Restaurant ' across the street - nor as charming . seriously , just walk across the street their General Tso is way better !<->2
We have been coming here for 20 + years . Even though this restaurant is in Scarborough , it is lose enough to North York . A very quiet getaway .. The view is intriguing .<->1
So today is Pink Dragon , chocolate monster , green machine , pb lovers , and our house salad ... Yummy . That should hold me over for 2 days . They also introduced 2 new cleanses . Ca n't wait to try .<->1
Best JA food in the valley . Great hot food at the restaurant and lots of goodies in the grocery . Friendly vibe and good music .<->1
Great food , so glad they are back in business . Please bring back the balsamic salad dressing ! ! !<->1
Best AYCE sushi ! Fresh fish and lots of variety for appetizers . I love that they have cucumber wrapped rolls on their AYCE menu ^ _ ^<->1
Great sushi and sake . Nice hole in the wall in the heart of Chinatown . If Ichiza is packed , this is the next stop<->1
Great comfort food place ! Super crazy on the weekends , but worth the wait !<->1
Never left a noodle bowl empty before , this is a first . Taste is simple and lack depth . Stopped eating mid way through . Do not get the spicy and sour beef noodle , very oily !<->0
Cool environment , nice music . We went on New Year 's Eve before heading to the hall . The nacho starter is huge and delicious , popcorn chicken is good , reasonable amount . Sangria also good . Waitresses ok .<->1
Big menu with a lot of options . The serving sizes are big so I recommend sharing with someone or plan to have leftovers . The tofu pad thai was delicious and I definitely recommend it . Good service and great atmosphere .<->1
Lately I 've noticed service has improved . The initial stuffiness has toned down with service now friendly and relaxed .<->1
Marajaw an ijo serbisyo . An ijo store gana an mga design . An ijo pagkaon lami pero gamay an portion . Ipadajon an marajaw na serbisyo sanan lami n pagkaon .<->1
Our go - to place for Chinese food in the Mesa / Tempe area ! We love their Mongolian dishes , vegetable fried rice , kung pao , brown rice , Etc etc ! Always great service & amazing prices !<->1
Really friendly and comfortable atmosphere . Good , fresh , creative sushi offerings . Great promotions and happy hour prices . Teppanyaki is also good . Most of all , staff is awesome ! !<->1
True Japanese food ! Very fresh fish and authentic preparation . Will definitely do well , I know I 'll be back !<->1
These stars are for Jade ! For being an awesome and hard working server in a huge place w lots of people and she 's the only one . BTW the red bean balls are SO GOOD !<->1
The entertainment was spectacular , The food was horrible . The ribs were tough , bad flavor , the jambalaya was fishy , no taste and very very disappointing . If we ever come back , it will just be for the Jazz , not the food !<->0
Pretty decent Pho but I 've had better ; I 've definitely had worse also . I also tried the shrimp spring roll , it is was decent also .<->1
Very expensive and small portions . When we went the bartender had his girlfriend there and paid attention to her only<->0
Amazing food and service . Great service , loved the environment . Keep up the good JOB ! I ca n't wait to come back<->1
I wish I could put negative star . The worst experience ever . Not even worth my time to write about the details .<->0
A phenominal establishment with great staff and amazing eats .. We went here for a breakfast while traveling and were pleased to find an amazing menu and very welcoming environment ! ! It 's a gem with a fun staff ..<->1
Really great flavors and courteous staff . Great happy hour menu . My new favorite sushi spot .<->1
I love this place . I eat here at least four times a week . Breakfast , lunch and supper . The soups are homemade daily . Their hamburgers can not be beat . Family dining and very friendly . Try it , you will like it .<->1
Just left . Received the wrong food item again . Drinks are made to my requests probably 1 out of every 4 unfortunate visits . Customer service should get better to serve loyal customers with better consistency .<->0
Seafood here is so amazing ! ! ! It 's really fresh and yummy . I think the reviews say it all . Can not wait for the next trip to Las Vegas . Nom nom nom<->1
great food , great price , great service :) never have authentic korean before but this one is awesome !<->1
Excellent . Food and service were great . JD rocks . Ribs were delicious . Location good . If in Charlotte North Carolina a must .<->1
I had the burger special for 12.50  . It was the best burger ( bacon , cheese , tomato , dill pickle ) I have had outside the US . I expect to go back during my 2 - week stay .<->1
Awesome service , this particular Grimaldis is the best in town ! Staff is friendly , knowledgeable , and geniuine ! Get meatballs on it ! ! ! no matter what you get ! ! !<->1
not surprised to see this place is closed ... Was there a month or so ago ... thought they would be closed by labor day ... guess we were right . The food was good ... but the service ... OMG ... would never make it in Summerlin<->0
Overly priced but very yummy and addicting ... Staff is always very quick at making any drink without thinking twice . Not to include how well the staff and customers interact making you feel very comfortable and welcomed<->1
Large cheese add ricotta . Strange but I crave this place all the time . Sweeter dough and sauce . Cheap prices and good carry out specials ! !<->1
Ordered a double whopper , was charged for a double whopper , got a single whopper . Thanks for screwing me out of an extra few bucks . Also do n't answer the phones ...<->0
I have come to this restaurant the last 5 times I have been to Vegas . Volcano Nachos are the best nachos of all time ! It can feed an entire family . I will always come here when I am in town .<->1
Yummy tacos ! Defiantly will be coming here more :) good was hot when I got it . Rare to find such an awesome place !<->1
Best place for fast Chinese food . I like the ho fun , mee go - reng and singapore noodles . They are open really late and deliver .<->1
Fantastic sandwiches and friendly staff . It takes sometime to wait for table because of crowds in lunch time , it 's well worth it .<->1
This place was great . Great atmosphere , great server , awesome food ( I had the grilled cheese ) . But the prices are insane ! I 'd be here all the time if it were about 2/3 the price .<->1
Excellent gelato at Dolce Vita . I always enjoy coming over here , I often come over here after I go to Thai food corner to cool my palate off !<->1
Fast service . They were out of a few items though . Bagels are good . Needed to be toasted a little more . Need more kids items<->2
From the start to finish we had a wonderful time . Excellent staff , ambiance , meal and wine selection . This is the place to go for an experience that is above the typical in Vegas .<->1
great location , friendly staff , busy , but it is dirty . this cafe needs an upgrade or a health inspector !<->0
Pretty huge selection of ramen . So far , Tonkotsu shio and shoyu are my favorites . I love it !<->1
You want awesome street tacos ? COME HERE ! ! Just down the street from ASU . Their steak and chicken is delicious and the tortillas are awesome tooI wish I had known about this place sooner<->1
These are seriously the most fantastic mussels you will ever have the privilege of enjoying . If you 're reading this and like mussels , head over at your earliest opportunity ! The service is fantastic as well .<->1
vegan vegas burger is pretty good here ! buttttt the best part was the skinny fries * drool * i love fries ! ! !<->1
This place is great ! Good service , great view , and great food ! ! ! Awesome ! ! Bailey was an awesome server ! The shrimp , tater tots , chicken sliders , and chips were yummy !<->1
Great breakfast at a great price . Had Mamas Short Stack . The pancakes were fluffy and tasty . The Chicken Fried Steak was delicious especially the gravy .<->1
Ordered thier chicken Alfredo for dinner , tasted fine . Woke up vomiting . First and last experience here .<->0
Seriously this place have the worst service . The staff need to go get retrain or get a new job .<->0
Great burgers with cheese but fries could be better . Service was done in a good amount of time .<->1
Great place , great atmosphere , friendly staff . My favorite is the sexy rexy . So many possibilities with hotdogs . Kids eat free on Wednesdays .<->1
Though certainly not bad this place seems highly over rated . Scallops were mediocre at best , & the formal atmosphere in small cramped quarters does n't appeal to my relaxation mode . Service was good . Not on my " must return " list .<->2
Best Chinese food I 've had in my life ! ! ! The reason why I stay at the silverton . The freshest Chinese you will ever get .<->1
Pretty average drink place . But I like how their containers are nicely insulated which keeps my drink cold for hours and hours .<->2
This place has got some really good smoothies , wraps , and sandwiches . If your looking for some healthy eats try this place is out . The owner Sam is really friendly too and she is generous with the portions !<->1
Good standard place for simple grocery and snack needs with good working hours . Nothing special about it though to make me go wow .<->2
Amazing sweet sauce ! Awesome and friendly service . This is honestly my favorite pizza joint ever . Keep up the good work !<->1
Stopped in for a quick bite . The Brussels sprout tempura was really good . The ramen was really good - we both had the black . Taking the leftover home to enjoy later . Staff was friendly and quick .<->1
Super awesome place ! The employees are great and patient with the kiddies . Fun atmosphere and the best ice cream variety ! !<->1
bagel is too doughy , just like white bread . French toast raw in middle . Steak was rare ( asked med rare ) . Coffee was lukewarm . Hash browns raw and soggy . SKIP IT .<->0
All organic fresh whole wheat pizza . Kinda on the pricey side for a vegan pizza but pretty delicious !<->1
This place is a delicious , cheap and clean local Mexican restaurant . I definitely recommend it to anyone who is trying to eat some good hole in the wall Mexican food !<->1
Great service . I mean for the amount of people at times that come through ... it 's good . Pizza is great and if you have more than like 4 - 5 people ... you might as well get a whole pizza . Overall good pizza<->1
J'adore cette place ! On se sent bien en entrant immédiatement . Personnel très sympathique et accepte une demande spéciale ! Je recommande pour personne seule ou en groupe ! A la prochaine ... Belle découverte ce vendredi matin .<->1
Sat at the bar at this place and it was just horrible . That 's all I the attention i will give this place . Save your self the disappointment .<->0
Delicious ! One of my new favorite spots for brunch . Try the breakfast pizza and one of the delicious bloody marys .<->1
This place is horrible . I can take a little bad service but the food sucks . Ca n't see how this place is still open . I rather go to Taco Bell across the street instead . Lol That 's pretty bad .<->0
Wow ... when I was talking to the owner he said it was the same family as Master Pizza . Boy was he right ! This took me back ! Excellent pizza excellent service . Ca n't wait to order from them again .<->1
Amazing atmosphere ... live music nice hip crowd . Great wings as well . The only problem was there was to much smoking which as a non smoker was hard to enjoy the music .<->2
I wish I liked this place . So many good reviews but my burger was undercooked and I felt the brews were lacking . Good atmosphere and I may come back to get it another try .<->0
So great to have this spot in the neighborhood ! Just had the first of hopefully many great dinners . Beautiful room , varied and unique menu and terrific service . Thank you for taking over this space .<->1
Disappointing all around . Food was mediocre , overlooked and tasteless . Service was slow . Would not recommend and will not be going back .<->0
Came here for morning greens smoothie and the lady at front counter was very nice and accommodating to my orders . Smoothies tasted like how I made at home so I was happy . I would definitely go here again<->1
This was okay . I ordered a salad and it was fresh and tasty , so not much to complain about I guess , but it was nothing exceptional and a bit pricey . Their menu was not very extensive .<->2
First time trying Zen Curry I love it ! Good environment and awesome customers service . Coming back again ! Recommended ! !<->1
I ordered the grilled portobello and Swiss steak burger . I frequently visit here so I knew what to expect in terms of customer service and food quality .<->1
Great atmosphere and service . Drinks were pretty good . The ONLY reason I did not give this place 5 stars is because the bathroom was disgusting .<->1
I love this place . It has a wonderful Greek salad , amazing wings and yummy burgers .<->1
This place needs some serious parental , and / or governmental guidance . Foods awful , nobody seems to want to work , it 's filthy , and they were out of their famous guacamole , but then I saw the person behind me get guacamole .<->0
Aside from having delicious treats the woman who was working is so sweet . The frozen yogurt is make with fresh fruit . It is topped off with a piece of chocolate . Yum<->1
So overpriced and bland ... Will definitely not come again . $ 20 for few crawfish tails and broccoli ? Hell no<->0
Lick the plate good ( yes I am a classy guy ) .<->1
Good drinks , but the burger and appetizers were terrible . Noisy and crowded too .<->0
Best Smoothies in town . I 'm a big fan of the peanut butter banana , and the Java Chip frozen Latte .<->1
Very nice place , great atmosphere , good place for a conversation entrées portions are small $ 20 - $ 30<->1
Pei Wei is always great ! My family and I go and get edamame and chicken lettuce wraps ! Lines get extremely long around dinner time . Best to go earlier in the evening or after 7ish . Fairly priced also !<->1
Came here with one other person . Wagyu beef was excellent quality . The service was very fast . We were never left waiting for food , and the servers also assisted in cooking our meat while we were eating . Recommended to try !<->1
I have only tried their samosas here . They are really good . The taste is authentic but it 's finely ground rather than minced . Their combo items are a bit pricey for prepackaged food though .<->1
Amazing food ! We had a big group with lots of picky kids , and it was fast and everyone enjoyed their meal . Do n't be afraid of the Johnny Utah , it 's killer ! ! ! A little taste of everything . Highly recommend it !<->1
We come here often and we Never have bad service here . Amazing sushi and great prices , and great happy hr . Definitely must try the Denny Roll , and if you like spice but not that much try the Arizona roll .<->1
Do n't get suckered by the $ 2.49 margaritas . If they had any tequila in them I could n't detect it . Lemonade at best . The food was mediocre . The service was good .<->0
Delicious sushi , wide variety of rolls , fast service , fresh fish , little rice and cold mugs for your beer ! ! !<->1
Food is always pretty good and the scenery is A + !<->2
Great food and service . The portions are pretty big and reasonably priced . Loved it .<->1
Great food ! I wish I had known about this a long time ago . Small place and really nice people . I will keep returning ... that is for sure .<->1
My favorite barbecue and my favorite salad are very busy every time . I have to wait for half an hour , but I 'm still willing to wait .<->1
Food was bad , service was mediocre , my drink was a glass half full and overpriced . Food was plain and had no taste and was really terrible .<->0
I just left this place with the most outrageously over - priced 12 " pizza I 've ever bought . Crust is tough , toppings are minimal . And a 20 oz fountain drink ( while you wait ) costs $ 3.50 ... ! ! Never again folks .<->0
Asada and adobada are the best . I really like the different salsas and homemade tortillas are so good .<->1
Great place ! The food was delicious . The pork belly buns were my favorite Had Street Noodle # 1 and Pad See Yew - personally liked the latter better . Cozy environment too :)<->1
Love the look and Vibe - Came for happy hour and it was nice ! kind of pricey but to be expected in a casino restaurant . Hear the brunch is the best - have to come back for that ! Overall good place<->1
Came here a couple years ago . Very underwhelming and a tourist trap . I do n't know how reheated burgers the next day were somehow better than the original , but that happened ... Went here with friends , but wo n't be returning .<->0
Apart from the long wait , the good was phenomenal . By far the best BBQ I have had in AZ . Will definitely go there again ;)<->1
Okayish sushi . Do n't go when it 's busy around lunchtime . They ca n't handle the workload and the quality of their rolls goes to shit .<->2
Good gyros , neat little place , sort of what South Side is all about<->1
Best place to get Aguas Frescas , and Ice Cream . Place super clean , and the staff very friendly . This is our go to place when we need to satisfy our sweet tooth .<->1
I had taking a date there we sat and waited for our food after it arrived I found hair in my food needles to say I 'll never go back<->0
Good salmon and decent beer . Their Heff was their best selection . I tried their IPA and was not a fan but every brewery has their top choice . Good open bar and great service<->1
If you 've never had Arepas this is the place to go ! Staff was informative about everything on the menu and even suggested the best side to order . Great food , definitely did n't disappoint .<->1
Great service . Brownie Chill with waffles ( $ 14 ) is always reliable . The quesadillas ( $ 10 ) are very filling and great to share . Found the Cafe Mocha Blanche ( $ 5 ) to be very sweet . I love how it 's open quite late .<->1
Great service great drinks and good food ! I had the bacon and chicken waffle . No complaints doc the job and staff was attentive<->1
Awesome Boba Lemonades and fresh unique macaroons . Customer service is excellent and friendly .<->1
The food is wonderful ! Salsas galore ! You might have a bit of a wait because this ai n't fast food so be sure you bring some patience ! Will eat here again and again !<->1
Service is great , good for a comfort food fix . Love the mac and cheese with grilled chicken .<->1
Reasonably priced , well made coffee with a great variety of not only coffee , but ways to make it .<->1
Honestly the rice for the sushi is not that great and the fish on some of the rolls seemed old , this was my second time going there resulting in the same flaws . Good prices , disappointing sushi<->0
This food is no joking matter . It is fab ! ! ! Also surprisingly cheap for Ballantyne .<->1
We tried the new location in Glendale . Good service , delicious food and reasonable happy hour prices . Love this place .<->1
Had the roast duck and it was delicious . Also had dim sum which was also great . Service was friendly and great . Gon na try the soup next time . I recommend trying this place .<->1
we arrive like 7 am so this place was perfect coffee and a cinabon was delicious I do recommend this place it was clean and good service<->1
Food awesome . Long waits and pricey . But the burger was the bomb . Truffle fries should be shared . Little pricey but good . Long waits n<->1
Horrible service . Amateur management . Mediocre , overpriced food ... I 'll never go back again .<->0
i 'll admit that it 's usually not a terrible experience . however , tonight was dreadful . if i could give zero stars i would .<->0
Lunch at XO Le was serene and delightful . Superb service and food .<->1
Fantastic food ! Great prices . Yummy .<->1
Best ribs in the area . The ribs are the special on monaday . Fall off the bone greatness and a pile of fries . Does n't get much better for the cost<->1
Very tasty food ! I got the ginger shrimps . 8 big prawns . Plenty and delicious . Service was a tad slow but they were busy . Would go back . Price is on the Hugh side ( $ 20 / plate )<->1
Always reliably good . Great beer selection as well as fabulous " bitch fizz " ( ciders , etc . ) and cocktails . Their pizza is outstanding AND they have a healthy menu . I generally steer clear of chains but this is an exception .<->1
This is a hidden gem ! Everything on our table was delicious ! ! ! Our server was an absolute delight ! If I lived in this area ... I would be a regular customer !<->1
Did I just give Chili 's four stars ? Yes , I did . And I 'd do it again ! I 'd do it again ! Why ? Because of the El Presidente margarita . And that 's my only reason .<->1
It 's can be hard to find good food in vegas . Happy to find this great cafe . Friendly staff , good food and big portions .<->1
Prettttty sure this place knows my family . Honestly , I have had zero complaints . The pizza is awesome , the nuggets are outstanding and they even have bomb salads ! ( See pic )<->1
What happened to this place ? ? We were so looking forward to this place after a few years , but we were let down by the quality and choices . The line was n't that long of a wait for a weekday .<->2
Best spicy tuna roll I 've ever had !<->1
Best sushi I 've had in vegas , very fresh and delicious rolls . Wish so badly that I still lived there so I can have this again !<->1
This place is great , Jose Ruiz made our experience an amazing one . Will definitely be coming back again<->1
Brunch was delightful . Had the salmon egg blinis and it was just perfect . The smoked salmon tasted as though it was made in house , and the blinis were fluffy and just cooked .<->1
Decent menue , lots of items to choose from . Service could of then a little more upbeat . They do have awesome chicken wings though ! !<->1
The brown sugar BLT is amazing ! ! ! The bacon is so good it seems unreal ! They have six different brown sugar bacon sandwiches but all that I wanted was the bacon ... That bacon and the Hawaiian bread ... Oooooh La Laaaaaaaass<->1
Amazing gyros , just like they make them in Greece . The gyro meat is good and the fries complete it . Friendly staff and reasonable prices .<->1
Good burger , good prices -- but not a place that I would go out - of - my - way for -- that place is still my all - time fave , Tessaro 's in Bloomfield ! I loved the cauliflower wings , though -- they were great !<->2
Best Pho in town ! We love the combo meat plate as well . All the meat is so tender and taste amazing . Do n't forget to try the spring rolls too .<->1
Very long wait . Once I got my food the fries and fish were overcooked , cold and underseasoned .<->0
Our first trip to Montreal and had this referred to us by a friend . Great atmosphere , fabulous food , and superior service . Highly recommend . Upstairs is excellent .<->1
Very good Korean food ! Tasty , great portions and so cheaply priced . Don ' t get fooled by the neon green walls , you will have a great meal . Casual but pleasant service .<->1
Excellent service pizza was good so where the chicken wings . Really liked the barbecue chicken wings<->1
Best Mexican food in Las Vegas ! Been going here since it first opened . Highly recommend .<->1
I went to this restaurant once and I thought I had a great experience after the second visit . Had very very very poor customer service experience ! The food was good but the service was discriminatory !<->0
Pretty good place . Separate bar area upstairs with lots of TV 's for sports . Nice size portions . A little pricey , but big portions .<->1
Every time I come here , the food is fresh and delicious and the service is good . You do n't have to be vegan to eat here . It 's my favorite place in downtown Phoenix !<->1
If you like mushrooms like I do , plenty vatiety on the menu . They were yummy . Staff can be improved though .<->2
A total highway robert for the worst Mexican food I ever had , it 's a shame ! Not recommended ! !<->0
5 star for the cold noodle . Never let me down :) The other dishes are good as well but cold noodle here is the best !<->1
I had the Wednesday special , beef ribs ... They were terribly salty . I got food poisoning after :( Service was good though .<->0
Great food . The location at the antique store is bad but they are moving in a month . The signature burger was great but a bit pricey $ 14 . They are extremely friendly and helpful .<->1
Very good food and excellent service . The staff was very nice and very attentive . Pappardelle with wild boar bolognese sauce was perfect . I will be back . Ps : food was reasonably Priced .<->1
Breakfast service was better than lunch . The food was delicious at both times . This beautiful cafe is more of a restaurant with a diner - like menu . It is well situated by the atrium with a view of the pool .<->2
Summer Rhodes is the best manager . She 's great , two of us spilled our tequila shots and she was there to rescue our day ! She 's extremely professional , and knows how to handle customer service so much ! She 's literally AWESOME ! ! !<->1
Straight up , the best pizza ever . I did n't care for the generic stuff , but the meatball pizza was phenomenal ! We went back twice . So good . Too good .<->1
The sushi is above and beyond what you would expect from the price and atmosphere . Well worth a visit from any part of Pittsburgh .<->1
Great dumpling usually busy place , some times waiting can be 1/2 hr . Pork dumpling are the best one<->1
I 'm really disappointed in Fuel . My hubby and I have been Fuel fans for years but my last visit was just that , MY LAST . The pizza was sad looking . I could 've gotten a better frozen pizza than this . SMH<->0
I 've been here three times now , and it 's been amazing every time . The steamed pork ( pork belly ) will give you a mouthgasm ! No joke ! Besides that , the side dishes are excellent and the service is top notch . I 'll be back !<->1
Good food , great service . Big portions and we enjoyed our meal . I would recommend this place and would come here again . Thanks for your great meal onMy Birthday .<->1
Loved the patio . Brunch Benny was excellent . Good service . Best view / outlook in the city . This is now my go to place for out of town guests . Hope they have a winter menu .<->1
Been waiting 30 minutes for my wrap . Had to ask about my order and noticed them put my order on the grill . No apology , no refund , no free next time ... very disappointed ! It took another 15 minutes !<->0
Great 50s decor ambiance and exceptional service . Very clean and fresh food . Glad to see a manager take so much pride . Other McDs should learn from this one . Will come again for sure .<->1
Good pizza , pretty quickly too . The garlic knots are really good . Reasonably priced , friendly staff .<->1
Lindaaa :) . She 's awesome , everyone here is awesome . I just came back 2nd time since last week bc it 's delicious . It 's my favorite restaurant you should try it .<->1
Fabulous place with a great atmosphere and the Osso Buco was out of this world . I would go back in a heartbeat . And the prices were not all bad . 10/10<->1
Yassssssssss ! the sandwiches are so delicious here ! ! ! I will go here again . I do n't like that it 's a bar cause I definitely saw some creepers but the sandwich yes !<->1
I read some great reviews and checked it out ... wonderful ! I am already planning my trip back . Incredibly reasonable prices .<->1
Great food . Service is great . Price is great especially for the quality of food . I had the avocado chicken , it was very good .<->1
Really love this particular Wildflower , clean , great service , and excellent preparation of food ! I 'd like to thank Anthony in particular , as well as Ferner for going the extra mile for my family and I . Thanks ! ! :)<->1
I came here with my brother for lunch and it was good ! I had the fried chicken BLT . I enjoyed it very much .<->1
After searching every where for my Daughters 16th birthday cake , we went into Caketini . They were SUPER ! They did a Fantastic job on the cake and it tasted GREAT . I would recommend them to anyone . Very satisfied ! !<->1
This is hands down the best sandwich shop in Cleveland . Every sandwich is crafted with love and packed with flavor . Have n't been let down yet and will definitely be back for more ! ! !<->1
Love the burgers and shakes , alcoholic and non alcoholic . Good beer selection . I build my own with a fried egg with the pretzel roll . It is pricey but this is one place I almost always go to when in Las Vegas .<->1
Off the strip , plenty of parking . Walked in and order . And it was delicious and fresh ! Will be coming back soon ! Tacos del Gobernador tacos de pescadotacos de camarón And the aguas frescas hibiscus lemonade was amazing ! Overall customer service was excellent !<->1
This place is a classic . A true old persons restaurant . Our waiter holly mollie , that 's all I got to say about that . Food was decent . I 'll go back .<->2
Terrible service . They took forever to prepare my burger and gave me the wrong sandwich !<->0
Best gluten free pizza I have ever had ! My boyfriend and I came here on a date and we ca n't wait to go back . The food was amazing , the staff was friendly and very attentive and the prices were so reasonable .<->1
I stop here for beer if I 'm in the area . Has better prices than total wine . Good place to stop for booze .<->1
Found this place when looking for a breakfast spot that 's not a traditional joint ( like IHOP ) . Atmosphere was great , staff are nice , and food was good . Will be back again for sure<->1
Overrated . Decent tasting food , overpriced , decent service , " meh " decor / atmosphere , good quantity of food . It 's a nice place to take someone for an upscale meal in a not - so - upscale area of Ohio .<->1
Great experience today . Good food , great service ! Great place to take friends from out of town to show off a real Pittsburgh eatery . Thank you , we enjoyed it .<->1
Never again . Overpriced . Food was not very good . Even the water tasted awful . And almost instantly we became sick .<->0
Very nice shop for finding African food . They had all the main ingredients I needed . Very convienient location as well . Highly recommend for any Africans looking for food and supplies<->1
the service stinks . waited for over an hour and no service not even water . we left and went to the hub . much better service .<->0
1st time having lunch here , THIS finna be a BREEZE ! It was . It was delicious . Peppersauce burger<->1
Pros : good portion , very decent price for what you get , good variety on the menuCons : quality of sashimi and rolls are average and not that fresh<->2
All I can say is totally Wow ! So creative and so delicious . I have eaten there many times and have been wowed every time . Warm , friendly wait staff too ! You owe it to yourself to visit .<->1
PHENOMENAL ! ! ! The food was awesome ! Service was great too . Buffalo chicken fries were amazing !<->1
Great food , friendly service , very consistent . Plan to keep on going back . Very good location near some of our favorite shopping areas . Triple D is always a good reference for the type of dining we appreciate .<->1
Great food at the lunch buffet and wonderful service too . Partial because when I went in with blue hair the owner called me a flower ;) however they have good naan and quick service . Always a nice meal<->1
This place is hands down awesome . Ghe only thing i would improve is make it bigger . This place has to make a killing especially during lunch with the buffet setup . Reccomend # 64 .<->1
Great burgers . Too much barter in the onion rings . 4 out 5 stars overallLove the cups<->2
Great food ! I usually go to another Chinese food place but this place is closer to me so I figured i d give it a try and i m glad I did . I will continue to go back !<->1
Asked for sample taste of two beers . Bartender said there is a charge foe samples ! No way . Will not be going back . Good breweries do not charge for samples !<->0
Pretty good ! I ordered the brownie sundae which was great . Moderate selection of cookies / brownies / toppings to choose from . Easy to locate spot on Mill . Staff was friendly . Fair prices - around $ 5 for the sundae .<->1
great food , fresh and tasty ! the traditional eggs Benedict and potatoes were super good ! ! i will be coming back for sure ! ! !<->1
Excellent place for martinis ! Big fan of the " Chocolate Peanut Butter Cup " Martini the most . The " Almond Joy " is also very good .<->1
If you want to reset your palette from steak houses , Italian food , or Asian food this is the perfect place .<->1
Killer breakfast burrito ! A little on the expensive side but I would definitely pay again . They are open at 0700 now too .<->1
My favorite is Olong tea with milk cap and mini boba .. so yummy .. i buy boba only in this place the one at chinatown .. i do nt know what tasted different with other kungfu place ..<->1
Last time I had chicken here it was superb ! ! Just do n't have it delivered ! Best chicken I 've had in town yet , and I 've had a lot of chicken .<->1
We always love the patio seating . The food is always fresh and good . Never had a bad experience with the staff or food at all . We come every now then for lunch .<->1
I noticed there are more of this restaurant opened in other parts of Toronto ... I hope they enjoy the food as much as I enjoy coming here because the food is so fresh and delicious .<->1
I ordered a salad to go , and took it on the plane with me . It was decent , what you would expect for airport food , and the price was extremely high ... which ... well , again , it 's airport food .<->2
Good ice cream place . Hubby and I shared a hazelnut crunch and it had a good nutella - esque flavor and little crunchy bits in it . Would definitely go back . It 's very refreshing on a hot summer day in Vegas .<->2
Do n't waste your money here . Foods and noodles are cold and burn . Pot stickers look like just come out from microwave . Receptionist is not welcoming .<->0
Although hours of business did n't match website we got there in time for a meal . Ribs were delicious and cheesecake was homemade . Definitely will go back next time I am in town .<->1
So happy there is another Thai place in this area . Our fave is drunken noodles and pad Thai for the kids . Fast , friendly , delicious , and inexpensive . New go - to .<->1
Really poor compared to the place around the corner but the same price . Noisy , no class and the quality was just not there<->0
A little expensive , but the sushi is worth it . Used the restaurant.com coupon . Good environment and quick service . You can park in the garage under Duke Energy and get the parking validated .<->1
Great place ! From price to quality to quantity , Mickey 's had it all . Whoever said you could n't have something fast , cheap , and delicious was wrong . Definitely recommend for breakfast or " brunch " .<->1
i came here from los angeles to eat the shave ice with my family of 9 and they all love it . great shave ice and place to hang out defintely will come back here .<->1
Great pizza , nothing special , very greasy so it 's not one of this artisanal pizzas . It 's the kind of pizza that you always imagine<->1
Overpriced . can get what we got anywhere . No seasoning . bad menu . Pathetic slice of prime rib . Might be good for catering but not dining . Amateurs .<->0
Shake Shack lives up to the hype ! I had a bacon cheeseburger and a vanilla shake , with shack fries .. Only downer , $ 18 bucks .. A bit over priced for a burger and fries .. After all this is CLT not NYC ..<->1
ShinBay is a very fun and adventurous sushi experience . The chef 's tasting menu was diverse and satisfying : the halibut appetizer and clam / mushroom entree were standouts . The relaxing atmosphere enhances a special occassion . The service could be crisper .<->1
Always the Best service and food . Yes You may pay 2 dollars more overall but no crowds , noise or feeling rushed . I love this little find<->1
Service is slow , but food is alright . Not many options beyond burgers and wings .<->2
Stopped in for a quick bite before a concert . Glad we did . Quiet place amidst all the noisy and packed bars nearby . Had a delicious slice which was just enough to tide us over . Friendly staff .<->1
Very friendly staff and quick service . Honesty the best fast food Chinese meal I 've had since moving from NY . Highly recommend .<->1
The best wings - - they are the whole wing ( 3 parts ) - - with the mixed sauce . A place for the town regulars , but it is very laid back and welcoming .<->1
Service was great as was the food . It could have been a little hotter at times but overall a nice change of pace to the normal LV fare .<->1
Went to have lunch but they we 're closed although their sign said closed for the holiday and that was yesterday . Well they just lost my business and the gift certificate I have as well will be given to someone else .<->0
Seats were worn out . Other than that , food was not too bad . It gets really busy specially on weekends and holidays .<->2
After a while of being here fresh food finally came out . Not worth the money you pay . Bathrooms are so disgusting I was scared to us it . Definitely wo n't be back here ever<->0
I 've been there on 3 occasions and have had a samplingof apps , soup , salad , sushi and chinese dishes . All very good . Friendly and professional staff . Weekly stop for me .<->1
This is just to sayI have eaten the burritosand the donutsthat were in your shopAnd which you wereprobably saving for aspecial customerForgive methey were deliciousso sweetand so bean - y . ( Credit : William Carlos Williams , translated by Val G . )<->1
The taco was great , but the Chinese food was not authentic at all and definitely overpriced .<->0
I Love this place ... its comfort food with a crazy price and service that would keep you coming back . The bar does a hugh amazing bloody mary ( Best in town ) and the kitchen keeps it simple but perfect .<->1
Best tacos in Las Vegas . Bit over priced , but worth every penny . Had the carne asada pastor and they were very tasty ... yummy<->1
Food is good not amazing . But the customer service there is awesome . I do n't go here often but when i do the bartenders always remember what I drink . That kind of service makes up for the kinda plain food .<->2
the dips just taste like sugar , the flavors are not distinct . and there are n't even that many dips . we tried 4 minis : dark choc , oreo , cookie , praline . nothing jumped out .<->0
Haberdish es un lugar sensacional no te puedes perder de ir a comer sus ricos platillos ala carta es un ambiente agradable con buena atención<->1
Just not quality good food . Ribs fatty . Stale buns , burnt burger . The idea is better than the reality .<->0
Delicious and the staff is so friendly . The Online app is so great ! Earn a free sandwich for just checking in and making your usual purchase . More coupons please<->1
This place is closed a few years ago . The listing should be removed .<->0
Nice patio to hang out on . Coffee service is maybe a little slow but it 's good coffee and a nice place .<->1
Excellent service , delicious appetizers and food , and great place to watch sports or check on scores while dining and socializing . Loved it .<->1
The food was delicious ! I had the grilled mahi mahi which was light and amazing . Also ordered a side of corn and it was to die for ! Definitely coming here again .<->1
Not even a 1 - inside cashier pleasant but drive thru baristas very rude . So however was working 8/ 13/16 at 11:50 am , put a smiley face on and be happy .<->0
Amazing service . Delicious sashimi . Wonderful oysters ! Thank you , Shane ! You 're a bad - a mother - shucker<->1
Max Was Great ! ! ! He Had Fantastic Customer Service Plus He Made Sure Our Raspberry Ice Teas Were To The Rim Of Our Cup Every time ! ! ! Max You Dope Bro<->1
I have been dining at Sushi Tachi for many years now and still believe it is one of the best all you can eat sushi restaurants in town .<->1
Good lunch specials - reasonable prices , includes soup & spring roll . Quick service . Tried fried rice with tofu and garlic shrimp . Both were well prepared and delicious . Recommended !<->1
Great Mexican food ! I think it was pretty authentic , although I have no way to confirm . The service was very friendly and it was a nice place to sit , talk , and eat !<->1
Food is always good but the customer service could improve . Staff is not very knowledgeable of which foods on menu are truly vegan or vegetarian .<->2
If I could rate this place - 5 , I would . Worst service ever . Horrible food . And absolutely no understanding of how to treat customers . Left after what they call ' beef carpaccio ' showed up ... more like a mushy raw meat pizza .<->0
Such a shame ... Their pizza is sooo good but the restaurant is sooooo gross and dirty ... Can you imagine what the kitchen looks like ? No thanks .<->0
Great sushi restaurant , service was excellent , staff was very friendly " chewy " and " Jose " , and the food was very fresh . Drink never went empty , and the variety of food is great . Will be going back for sure !<->1
I love their breakfast burritos . They 're pretty fast , too , going through the drive through . The red sauce is good , but I prefer their green .<->1
Food was OK but the service was not up to par . We were sitting awhile before we got our drink orders . And we needed refills and had to locate our server .<->2
Their food quality is not bad . But staff are rude , dishonest , and they hardly speak any English .<->0
I ve only ever been here for drinks , but its always been a good time . Great selection of beer and libations . And i m still waiting to see the Seamus ghost ...<->1
Great Food and Great Beer ! The restaurant itself looks like a beer hall and the steins are an awesome plus ! My recommendation is the dirty frys , a Schneider and Brothers beer and a BratWvrst !<->1
WP . Always Rocks . Loooove his Restaurants . Went there few Times . Always Perfect Food . Nice stuff ! ! !<->1
If you 're in the area and hungry , do yourself a favor : stop here and eat . What a great discovery that I would have totally missed without Yelp !<->1
Great burgers and really good service . The beer selection is large and the fried pickles are some of the best in Charlotte !<->1
Somewhat pricey for what you get . I do like aqua Fresca they serve . Service is ok and wait can be long .<->2
So it 's officially my second time ordering on delivery the service is quick the food was correct everything was good and fast what more can you ask for<->1
This place is great for pho ! It 's closer than my regular place and the service is always nice . I normally just do the pho and I have never been disappointed .<->1
The food and atmosphere was amazing our server was friendly and knowledgeable and his recommendations lead to an amazing experience . The owner even came out and took time to shake my hand . I was very impressed with the entire visit .<->1
I just finished dinner with my wife and mother - in - law . We are all raving about the amazing meal . The staff was extremely helpful , and every dish we ordered was extremely fresh and delicious . I highly recommend this restaurant !<->1
Great place to eat some oysters and make fun of all the guys in skinny jeans and man buns .<->1
Great , fast and healthy food . We ordered the Forbidden 9 rice and the Thai Cashew Quinoa dish both with chicken . Do n't forget the lemon cupcake ! ! ! Has a great atmosphere to the place .<->1
Great food and EXCELLENT SERVICE ! ! My waiter was all over ensuring we had what we needed ! What a great experience !<->1
The place is very small so you may want to call ahead to see if they have tables available if you have a large party . I do n't think they have a table that is large for more than 4 - 5 people .<->2
The food and drinks were delicious . The staff was very friendly . We enjoyed the cozoness of the restaurant . I look forward to visiting again .<->1
First time there and it was fantastic ! Nick was a great server very friendly yet professional , gave me great menu options & ensured my overall experience was great !<->1
What a great place to eat in gourmet style buffet for $ 35.00 . Long time wait , i mean really long wait , . you should get some food before you get in to the line ..<->1
Great place we are frequent visitors Fish manchurian dry with extra spice and chicken Hakka chow mein are our favourites . Recently we ask for less oil as too much oil is used in dishes<->1
Hands down best shwarma joint in T . O ! I 've been to many , but , none quite like this ! The lineup at lunch says it all !<->1
Slow service , servers standing around talking , tables not wiped off and order was messed up . Seems like this place is going downhill<->0
Been to this specific Rocco 's a few times . Only have gotten carry out . Seems legit . Food is above average . Service above average . Have gotten calzones mostly and enjoyed them l . WillBe back .<->1
I waited patiently for so long for the Madison location to open ! Some of my favorite tacos !<->1
Good food and excellent costumer service , looking forward to go back and try more subs<->1
Best Chicken Marsala I 've ever had . Also , save room for the delicious gluten free chocolate mousse .<->1
Love the micheladas here ! Love the crab legs of course but also like the grilled salmon on rice ! Service is always great here so I do nt mind that they charge gratuity . Fun friendly casual atmosphere .<->1
Restaurant vraiment chouette , j'adore encore plus depuis leur déménagement ! La cuisine du chef est maintenant au diapason avec son emplacement , les deux sont tout simplement sublimes ! !<->1
Only reason I 'm giving more than one star is because there was one employee that acknowledged my presence . Other than that , when you need assistance , it seems like almost every associate just does n't want to be bothered at all .<->0
Best burger you 've ever had in your life . If you disagree , you either know something I do n't or your palate has no business writing reviews here .<->1
Sorry . Disappointed I 'm used to the great service and food at whp casino . This place is shabby looking no flavor to the food and the old guy behind the bar is goofy<->2
I read some reviews that complained about how long they waited for their food . I always call in my order . They 're friendly servers have it ready when I get there . The Tuna sandwich is very good .<->1
One of the best looking water and ice stores with the friendliest staff . Great atmosphere to grab an ice cream . Kids activities at the tables are great .<->1
Nice place to people watch while sitting outside . The tuna and mango salad was excellent and the Bao 's were very tasty . Friendly service made the visit very nice .<->1
Great pizza + no waits + cheap = highly recommend when you want to binge on cheeseWe ordered the mushroom pizza which did n't have as many mushrooms as we would have liked . But overall it was great !<->1
The staff here is so generous and very accommodating to the patrons . I asked for Pancit ... and almost had to ask them to stop scooping lol . And their serving area is extremely clean !<->1
WORST SERVICE EVER ! ! ! Seriously . Get it together , Half Moon . It 's too bad because the food is decent . Waitresses have no idea what is going on . Asked for a manager and no one knew who it was . It 's complete chaos .<->0
Omg this is the best spicy catfish nuggets , Mac & cheese and fried okra ever . I will definitely go back and let friends know about papa joes . Prices are not out of line with the amount of food you get . Excellent<->1
Its my home away from home . Love the bartenders and all the other regulars . Last nights open bar / costume party was awesome !<->1
Best . Burger . Ever . Service was slow but friendly . The drafts were great and the fries and burgers were slammin ' .<->1
Bruschetta ( pumpkin and kale ) = excellentBruschetta ( mozzarella ) = excellent . Lamb gyro = so so Misto frito = good but not greatService = so so<->2
Love this place ! Best bean dip I 've ever had and the chicken chimis are great . Service is good and the chips are always refilled !<->1
Still one of the best places in Old Town . Service can be indifferent , but the food is great . Make a reservation if you can .<->1
The food was amazing but the service was a bit sluggish . Sucks to sit outside and be harassed by the homeless . But I will give it another chance .<->2
I tried for the very first time , strawberry 's with cream are really good ! Place is worth trying !<->1
Got the family platter for me wife and three kids . Was plenty of food . Loved he corn brisket was good he chicken and ribs were not on same level . The price was good and we took some home .<->1
This target is the perfect size for me ! Always has awesome things on the clearance aisles . Team members there seem very happy and helpful .<->1
Just had some amazing fish tacos . The ingredients all are very fresh . Highly recommend !<->1
Tonight with my hubby and his cousin went here , good food and drink . But I think you come to here eat must to order their fajitas , it is great and so much for you .<->1
Love their pizza ! ! ! Very fresh . Their cannoli was really good too . They seem to have great selection of wines .<->1
Best dinner I 've ever had . Absolutely awesome . Kind of addicting , ca n't wait to go back . This cozy place is the best ! ! Do n't wait go today<->1
Great rise burrito with mixed sweet potato / regular fries at a great price . Lemonade was good too and they did n't make it too sweet . Nice folks at the counter<->1
This place is a regular for my family and I , the food is great and the service is good .<->1
Absolutely delicious ! Did n't have a wait at all . The best biscuits . And their caramel apple cider mimosa was so good<->1
FUCK YES ! ! ! SO GOOD ... My GF & I had everything possible .. even the secret cotton candy which I loved bc it was Grape flavored .. and yes i m part blk ^ _ _ ^<->1
Nowhere near as good as I had expected with the reviews that it has ! Very very loud atmosphere you can barely hear yourself talking and the food is definitely nothing to write home about !<->2
For an easy to go pizza this place is fantastic ; they experiment with different flavors and have no issues making any changes to your choice of pie .<->1
This place is pretty consistent with their taste . Prices are alway great , nothing special about it but it 's always satisfying . Not going to break your wallet . Enjoy .<->2
Delicious sushi and real wasabi . Went for lunch and was n't hungry at dinner . Mochi was a little too melted but still tasty . Great sushi in the desert .<->1
My favorite Mexican restaurant by far . The staff is great and the food is even better . Also the price is right . Do your self a favor and visit .<->1
The food was spectacular and the service was great ! Love the location because my family can check out a movie and grab a bite after !<->1
Great cheap food and drinks ! Nice atmosphere , place has been there since early 1900 ' s . Staff , very friendly . Across from the Christmas Story House .<->1
As long as you get there at least an hour before closing , the foods consistently fresh , I 've seen people have a fresh order made if you 're extra picky too . Nice cheap fast Chinese food . Not much else to it .<->1
I 've been coming here for years for the GB Beer Mushroom Chicken . It 's the best thing on the menu !<->1
Right on the strip you can get a big square thick crust slice of pizza for 3.48 cents . The pizza is decent and they also serve manicotti , lasagna , and salads . Decently priced , okay food right on the strip - - enough said .<->1
Disappointed , stopped for the first time , ordered Chicken Lo Mein , they were out of noodles , had the Chicken fried rice instead , terrible , rice was n't cooked , underdone , chicken and veggies were overcooked , needless to say , probably wo n't go back !<->0
Wow ! Big portions for breakfast . Good food . Good service . Prices are a little on the high side . Give it a try .<->2
Good food , wide variety , efficient service , and friendly to all kinds : meat eaters , vegetarians , beer drinkers ...<->1
We love this place . Very reasonable and delicious food .. Do n't forget to try their baklava .<->1
Place has decent food but the service was unsatisfactory . The place was not so great either , no ac just a table fan . Do nt go in with high expectations .<->2
Awesome super cool experience ! Excellent fresh food , served by awesome people ! Great vegetables and interesting herbs everywhere ! Ask for Kevin to serve you .. super funny . Can ' t wait to go back again ! ! !<->1
Got a steak and cheese with some sort of special sauce . I was n't that impressed . I will try again just not that sandwich .<->2
Generic pizza place that s very cheap and very filling . Its like pizza hut but in canada . Wings were very good .<->1
The chicken and mushroom pie was heavenly ! The crust fresh and flaky . Usually I leave the edges on a pie , but this time , NOPE ! The cinnamon bun was delicious , too !<->1
Delicious food and cool atmosphere . Staff were friendly and service was prompt . We continue to return !<->1
Poor service . Very rude on the phone . Delivery took almost an hour and a half . Never ordering from her again .<->0
Great sourdough bowls . All the soups and chili 's are fantastic !<->1
Wow ! Came in here on the reviews of other Yelpers , SO glad we did . Got the California Surfin burrito ( amazing ) , the chile relleno , the beef tamale , and the camarones en el Diablo . So much food , and all so freaking good .<->1
The Alchemy was highly recommended from Madison locals , and now I know why . Maize salad =<->1
Great service great food ! Gary hood is the man ! Will be back definitely ! Also the wings are out of this world !<->1
We 've tried many different dishes and the food is always delicious . Great customer service whether dining in or carrying out . Definitely recommended .<->1
This was my first time at Café Moulin and I absolutely loved it . The atmosphere was very cozy and the staff was very friendly . I got a PB & J crepe and it was both delicious and filling .<->1
Fabulous food . There is a wait for a reservation , but well worth it .<->1
I asked them to add Some hot water to my Espresso , I think they added tap water to itDisgusting !<->0
The menu is ever changing and dynamic ! Certainly a culinary experience worth having ! Go for the 3 or 5 course meal and you wo n't regret it .<->1
Soups are wowzy spicy and the presentation is cool . Pad Thai is as good as it gets . Also the the Dragon appetizer .<->1
First , great bbq for sure . However got there on a Thurs night at 745 and they were out of Turkey and Chicken , they do n't close til 9 pm , bad business . Quite pricey .<->0
Awesome Thai food . See ew is the best we 've had in a while . Quick and easy take out service . Ca n't wait to go back .<->1
A Gem in Downtown Las Vegas ! The Perfect spot to have a cocktail and a great dinner overlooking downtown . It 's best to make reservations . I recommend Nicky 's Chicken & Artichokes or Joey C 's Filet Mignon .<->1
an old hauntgreat if only because the food is good 24/7 the ahi tuna burger is yumand the chocolate cake is great around 3 a . m . i 've also seen lots of celebrities there , if you 're into that sort of thing ...<->1
Been coming here for over 15 years and never gets old . Everything is great but I recommend the bean and cheese with sauce and add rice . Nobody makes a better bean and cheese burrito than Elmers .<->1
Enjoyed a quieter atmosphere seated outside with my family . The waitress was friendly , patient and accommodating . Food was fair and the drinks were reasonably priced . The Chimini birthday desert made our night . Thanks<->1
Best iced Chocolate Mocha drink ever . Not too sweet . Everything tasted as if it was made from scratch . Quant non assuming cafe in working neighborhood . Do n't miss when in Vegas !<->1
Exelant ! ! Very good food ! Fresh , ditaild , flaxible , good service . Divine desert , exelant chiz cake and chocolate cake !<->1
I went there for lunch . The place was pretty quiet . The waitress passed by me 3 times , never said hi . I finally just left .<->0
The food was excellent as well as the service ! We loved the empanadas and especially loved the chorizo sausage . You have to have their special green sauce on the side .<->1
Great recommendation from a friend . Sake selection was great . Food was fantastic . Definitely will go back again ! Hope you come to the Ahwatukee / Chandler area !<->1
Always number one in my book ! Great service and wonderful coffee ! Sometimes a bit of a line but it moves fast .<->1
Deeeeeeeeeeee - licious . 75 % juicy , tender lamb yet with an outer crisp crust . Just enough of fresh veggies for a superb contrast ( just like in the middle east ) .<->1
Best pizza in Calgary . Nice cold craft beer with lots of choices . Love this place .<->1
Best Breakfast and service I 've ever experienced at Coca ! Jess went above and beyond this morning and exceeded all expectations . The Shakshuka is out of this world ! Thanks for the recommendation ! I will definitely be back<->1
Nice place and attentive service . I understand you are in a retirement community , but some seasoning on the food would work wonders . Your roasted chicken was awesome but the mashed potatoes were disgusting .<->1
Rick 's Adobo fried rice was the bomb ! ! ! Great service . Support local anytime the food is this good ! ! !<->1
No complaints about the food or service my comment is whoever cleans the floor , the floor is slippery and people nearly fall before they get to a seat you have old people in the morning do something about the floor<->0
DO NOT GO HERE UNLESS ... You want HORRIBLE food , mistake after mistake on your orders and service that is worse than the food .<->0
Worst taco bell ever . Bad customer service . Waited forty minutes in line at the drive through .<->0
The service is not good , but they have every merchandise you can think of . Ever Time I need something they have it .<->1
Highs : quality food , good service , some decent happy hour prices Lows : tiny portions at high prices<->2
Try a few times for lunch and love the Pork Bone soup here .. can tell the best compare to other Korean restaurant . The services is nice and friendly .<->1
From Austin , TX . This place knows how to make some mean and tasty ice - cream . Had the cardamon , toasted coconut , and the seasonal berry cream . All fantastic ! waffle cones made in house . Does n't get better than that !<->1
This place gets 5 stars cuz the staff are super friendly and accommodating , very good customer service here and food is yummy !<->1

Love this place , best brisket ever , the place is very clean and the service is awesome .. thanks Tennessee grill for the amazing job<->1
So , no whipped cream for my Espresso con Pan . Settled for a double shot of espresso and half and half ( no , not even real cream ) . Espresso almost tasted burned . It was not a good experience .<->0
Clean facility , friendly helpful ladies at the counter . Fun place worth checking out !<->1
We tried an Italian sandwich while drinking and gambling at Planet Hollywood . It did not disappoint ! The bread and meat were delicious ! The potato salad was blah , but could be personal preference . See you next time !<->1
Always good food and good service at the egg . Their Veracruz sauce is awesome . It is worth asking for some on the side with just about every meal .<->1
This is now my favorite place to eat sushi ! Good quality sush and Claire is such an amazing server ! I love this place !<->1
This place was great . I had a brioche with a rasberry lemon filling and a salmon baguette sandwich . It was really good ! The coffee also taste great and was a good price .<->1
The hot and cold ceviche is ridiculous here . Management are approachable , friendly and warm . Happy hour and tequila Thursday makes it way more affordable . The margis are delicious ! !<->1
It 's always a safe bet at Olive Gardens . Usually good food with great service . So far they have n't disappointed .<->1
You would n't think a great cafe would be hidden in this nondescript industrial plaza , but inside is a really nice cafe with excellent breakfast and lunch food . Definitely an East Valley gem if in area .<->1
The food was very good and I loved the flavors , I thought our waiter was good but the waiter next to us was amazing .<->1
You need to have supervision at all times , especially if your going to leave new workers that are n't experienced alone in the restaurant . I do n't blame the workers I blame management .<->0
We were exceptionally pleased with our first trip to Postino . We shared a plate of bruschetta and split a Brussels sprouts salad . Everything perfect and leaving us wanting to return ! !<->1
Pineapple bun was super crispy ! ! Come around 3:30 pm when they come out of the oven . Happy high - tea'ing !<->1
Amazing Calamari Appetizer ! Enough for an entire meal . Thank you Ryan for the incredible recommendation and perfect service ! Mia Bella is lucky to have you on their team Ryan ! !<->1
Stopped in here a few weeks ago , stock was low on a lot of stuff . The male owner was working and was a total jerk , completely unprofessional and rude . I will take my business elsewhere !<->0
Great service , AMAZING burger ( big grit ) very reasonable . Good music , good vibe and very friendly . Ca n't ask for much more from a restaurant .<->1
Had a tasty Sunday brunch with my daughter here ! They had a good selection of items for children and adults and they also had nice coffee options , like lattes , mochas , and cappuccinos . We will definitely be back again !<->1
Popular place and pretty much anything on the menu for the picky person ...<->1
The food had fantastic flavor and the staff worked well together . I was along with the rest of our group a bit disappointed at how long it took to get our check after we asked for it .<->1
The food is ok it 's nothing special . Small plates for a big price . The service is great . The staff was so cool and make sure you are good .<->2
? ? ? ~ ~ Happy Hours , ? ? 3 - 6 ? ? ? mid - night mints mocha ? ? ?<->1

Decent ramen , clean bathrooms , ladies bathroom has complimentary feminine hygiene pads , great service<->2
Although there are many Roberto 's in town , this one is by far the best . I 'm not sure what they do different , but I 'm disappointed every time I go to a different one .<->1
I always love this place . Fresh and awesome stuff Best staff ... today Jim in the butcher shop was so kind . They were out of Bison ribs and he told me he could have some fine in 2 hours . Great customer service !<->1
Awesome ! ! ! I ordered the pbj burger and it tasted heavenly ! Service here is great , as well .<->1
Great menu ! Staff was friendly , helpful and had great suggestions . Recommend if you are in the Warehouse District area .<->1
The best food I 've ever tasted . The Thai fried rice is delicious . I come here every time I go to Vegas .<->1
Decided to eat here for dinner . The owner and chef were very welcoming of our group . Ended up ordering the Iceman along with a milkshake . The food was great and well worth the money .<->1
Every Thursday is prime rib night . Fantastic price and good quality . Queen cut around $ 12 and King 's cut 14 . Great rooftop bar over looking the CLT<->1
Great food . Everyone here is really nice , especially the tall skinny guy , I never got his name but he is always there . Not sure if he owns the spot but great customer service .<->1
This place is the " Culvers " for those of us kids who grew up in Utah . Classic throw back burgers , frozen custard , and ambiance .<->1
Tacos = Delicious ... Picnic Bench Seating = TerribleOrder the chips and guac , the carnitas and short rib tacos and request a booth . Because the picnic bench will ruin the experience .<->1
Great service , I love the pepperoni pizza and they have some great specials . Its a neighborhood shop and easy to get too !<->1
Took my Granddaughter here for dinner . OMG What good food . The service was very good and we did n't have to wait long . this is our new go to place . Prices are very good . We went during happy hour .<->1
Service was good , food was good . I like the soda machine they have ( with the customizable drinks ) . Price was fine . Portion was plenty . Would definitely come back .<->1
Went here on a corporate group event . Small portions , lacklustre taste . Would never come here if it were not free . Overpriced and not worth it imho .<->0
I have been there twice & the good food & good service is consistent . I usually go there for the fish & chips but change the chips for a poutine ... So good but I can ` t indulge like this too often lol<->1
The food was pretty good but the service was horrible . Took forever for everything . Nice atmosphere ( a little loud ) but I will try it again . The quesadillas were awesome and the guacamole as well ! !<->2
Incredible French toast . I thoroughly enjoyed my meal and the atmosphere of this tiny little place . Will definitely be going back .<->1
Awesome food , drinks and music . Great place to hang out after your meal . Had the best fish and chips ever .<->1
Your standard chinese takeout place , but they are fast and consistent .<->2
? ? ? d . ? ? ? d ? ? ? d ? ? ?<->2
Food is fresh and quick ! Amazing chinese food hidden gem must go . It small dinner but room to sit and eat .<->1
This was my first time trying out the ' assembly - line ' style in an Indian restaurant , and I 've got to say ... it 's a hit ! I will definitely be coming back here again . Fresh ingredients , friendly staff , and a very clean place .<->1
Good food for good prices . Staff attentive and friendly , definitely deserves an extra tip .<->1
Foods great but the customer service is so bad that I would nt even think of going back ... ! ! !<->0
I ca n't believe I 've never reviewed this restaurant before . We come here all the time . Will add more details later , but they just unveiled a new vegan menu !<->1
Miyagi San and oxtail fries were amazing ! Miyagi San was the most flavorful burger I 've ever had hands down .<->1
Great times and food . Shout out to the best bartender and hostess in Las Vegas ! ! ! Sliders were good and service was attentive and no issues with any of our orders .<->1
Cool spot with great food and an amazing beer menu . It 's become our favorite " I do n't want to cook so let 's go out " spot .<->1
THIS PLACE IS AMAZING ! Any food made by Dan is definitely far better than other places . Great food , good atmosphere , and fair prices ! I will definitely return<->1
Bad food ! Bad portions ! Poor service ! Quality is aweful . Management is cheap . $ 6.00 beer with pizzas that taste like Dijorno or Ref Baron . By all means keep going back hoping it gets good again .<->0
Enjoyed the food here . Seated right away . Food was served promptly . Filling breakfast for three was $ 33.24 . I would come back .<->1
Went in for the soft opening today , excellent menu , friendly staff , beautiful decor . The empanadas were my fav , everything else we had on the menu had excellent flavors and presentation too . Will be back !<->1
Definitely a quick bite place . I think the pizza is very good , one slice get me full . Overall pizza is good and the price very good ... Open til 3 am = ]<->1
This place is always tits . Best service , providing that you 're not an asshole hopping up in the bathroom , or rude to the staff . Shouts out to Tracy and Jacob , best bartenders ever , and conversationalists .<->1
Ok , ... for a chain . I try to support local business as much as possible . Pricey , good for a date night I guess .<->2
Sanaido is amazing ! Awesome tricks ! They are very aware of # glutenFree and # Celiac issues and are accommodating ! Wonderful place ! Plan on coming back again multiple times per week ! :-)<->1
Great brunch - be sure and try and deviled eggs . Anthony our server was attentive and friendly . Thanks for a great experience .<->1
We stayed at Luxor & enjoyed buffet lunch & dinner about 5 - 6 diff occasions ! Very impressed considering we went to the Mirage & MGM buffets too . The Luxor is much better for variety , quality food & service ! Well done Luxor<->1
This place should add a dollar to its price listing . It 's extremely expensive but well worth it . The views are impressive the service is impeccable and the food is delicious ! I highly recommend it for a special occasion spot .<->1
Average Chinese food here . Dinner prices seemed a bit steep but they do have large portions . I have n't found much Chinese food that I love in the area but so far this is one of the best .<->2
Quick stop for something to cool off with has the infamous dole whip that you usually only find at Disneyland :) On the plus side there are other flavors along with yogurt & custards .<->2
Stopped at this gem on the way to Utah . The pizza slices are huge , unique , and delicious . Classic setting : simple menu , simple decor , and very cozy . The staff was very friendly and the service was fast . Worth the stop !<->1
Not a fan of a restaurant that tries to be everything to everyone . This is an example where Italian meets far East , and makes it passable . No real flavor to speak of but everyone has a choice .<->0
Great food for a small chain . Tortillas used for tacos are delicious . Highly recommended and not expensive .<->1
Excellent food . Fresh sushi and great service . Highly recommended . Love the angry dragon roll .<->1
Greatest pizza in town . Great service from Becky too .<->1
We randomly walked into this place for dinner , and every single dish that we tried was amazing ! We were with 3 kids , including a 21 - month - old baby , and they were very accommodating . Highly recommend !<->1
Love how quick and easy this location is ! I pay as they 're making my sandwich so I can get into and out quick . Also such amazing workers & management , always smiling faces & great service ! !<->1
The big eye was pretty spicy and the guy who served us was really attentive and helpful . It was a good experience for having had a groupon<->1
This place is absolutely amazing ! You CANNOT beat the price for the yummy food ! The hummus is handmade ... and it definitely makes it perfect ! The people working there are awesome ! This is definitely a hidden gem !<->1
Great BBQ , easy parking ( huge lot right behind ) , good prices , extremely quick and friendly service , and overall a great experience . I had a brisket sandwich with a side of pulled pork and mac n cheese . Each was delicious .<->1
Updating my review . This has become my go to Einstein 's since it is walking distance from my home . The staff is friendly and orders are good . At times seems a little understaffed .<->1
Fantastic sushi experience ... had the ex - wife , the Linda , sashimi salad , and it was just incredibly tasty - layered with flavors and textures - BAM !<->1
Had the crab fried rice , shrimp rolls , chicken kabob platter and crab rangoons . Everything was really good !<->1
$ 5.25 for a small latte , which I was told that was n't sweetened but it was . Nuff said ! !<->0
Smoked house salmon was NOT SMOKED ! ! ! Carne asada had no flavor ! Ahi poke was dry and old !<->0
That was the worst breakfast and coldest coffee I 've had in my life . And very rode disrespectful costumer service . What a luck .<->0
Dark atmosphere , cool music , considerate service , khaula burger was delicious + the coleslaw on the side !<->1
Great experience . Had the ying yang hotpot . The hot soup was pretty spicy but filled with flavour . Same with the clear broth . Lots of meat , veggies and various types of noodles . I 'm really impressed with this place !<->1
Relaxing and inviting . It 's a very cute neighborhood coffee shop definitely recommend it !<->1
Absolutely delicious lunch . We loved the complementary homemade parker rolls and the club sandwich . Friendly service and nice farm - to - table atmosphere .<->1
Been waiting an hour for buffalo & fish tacos . Mine came out as a sandwich . Waiter did n't acknowledge my order being wrong . He 's been scarce AF too . Not feeling like a generous tipper ...<->0
Very decent , quick Mexican food . No complaints !<->2
Amazing food ! I personally get the chicken schwarma with a falafel mixed in usually . Everything I 've tried so far has been excellent .<->1
Love tenshi ! Been here many times . Went here on my first visit to Calgary in 2010 . Tiny restaurant but the food is delicious<->1
Really solid food . Went for happy hour and then used a Groupon deal that was a ton of food . We ended up taking three to go boxes !<->1
Pleasant people super atmosphere good food . Slowish service . Great view of the Bellagio .<->1
Worst tacos Ever ! ! ! Beef does n't tasted anything , all lettuce and jalapeños ! ! I wasted 13.80 for this tacos ! ! Ca n't even eat it properly because tortilla is soggy !<->0
Great breakfast bagel but the service was what made it a 5 star experience ! Thanks to Tanarus Henry for being so kind and helpful !<->1
Excellent and authentic Mexican food . Please ask for Norma . She provided the best service and loves her job .<->1
Very good authentic food and nice lady owner ! Must go to Vietnamese restaurant when you are in Vegas !<->1
Amazing food ! They pack the plate , that I could n't eat it all . The lady / cook ( not sure if she 's the owner ) was Very friendly . They also gave us free plantains , that were very tasty . Will definitely come back .<->1
Decent ... But I have had better ... Also the pricing is above average for the same type of food . Been here twice . Probably wo n't be returning .<->2
Très bon buffet indien , qualité de mets et des saveurs indiennes comme on les aime . Le personnel est agréable , sympathique et sans prétention .<->2
Like this lil grocery . Very convienient , lots of choices for a smaller store , clean , produce is always good and keeps well . Love the fresh meats they have at the counter and their ground coffee .<->1

The breakfast burritos were super delish . I highly recommend them . I also got a raison somethi g pastry . Not sure of the name but wow ! Super flavorful as well . I 'll be back for more .<->1
Fantastic vegetarian / vegan restaurant ! I bring my meat loving friends here , and they are all impressed with how good the food is . The desserts are awesome too - try the fudge cake ! SO fudgy and rich and completely vegan ! ! !<->1
Came here on my birthday with my boyfriend , ordered dozens upon dozens of oysters . There was an impressive variety to choose from . I had a fantastic evening .<->1

Cute lil spot ! Staff was super friendly ! Thanks guys for my coffee before I hit my 5 hour drive home ! See ya next time I 'm in AZ !<->1
The food was ok . Service really sucked . Not sure if it was because we were in a group ( 6 people ) . Wo n't be coming back - at least not anytime soon .<->0
Ordered a pizza for the first time . The tomato taste was so overbearing that you could not taste anything else . Better off going to Little Ceasars .<->0
Over priced , nothing to justify the fact that its a burger joint . The fries shared the same frier as their " bologna " fried sandwiches , meaning they came out horrrrible .<->0
Classy , fun , and comfortable . Friday night live band playing R & B and Hip Hop hits always delivers great entertainment .<->1
Just stopped in to get some cream corn ... mmmmmmmmm<->1
Wonderful service . Staff has great knowledge of menu . Beautiful location . Went while Christi was behind the bar and she Is the best . Most friendly !<->1
Amazing food . Amazing Service . Great ambience ! Try the buffalo cauliflower ! Vegan options too , bonus !<->1
Great surprise to see a Pinkberry in an airport . Got the tart with strawberries , blueberries & granola . It was around $ 8 - pricey - but definitely worth it . The amount of toppings they had & the available flavors were great .<->1
Good food overall . But nothing special . But it is ayce so ca nt be too picky . Surf & Turf is great .<->1
Came in from out of town and found this place . Great food and service . We got the wings and the burger both were fabulous .<->1
This place is a joke . Disgusting . Also , they have idiots working for them . I really would find it hard to believe that the owners had ever even been to NYC , let alone eaten pizza there .<->0
They serve fresh squeezed ( real deal ) orange juice and serve a delicious breakfast . This place is off the charts<->1
I loved this place ! The food was amazing and I really jived with the low key atmosphere and staff . The caviar deviled eggs and glazed doughnut bread pudding were killer .<->1
Great food and great quick service . Best Chinese Food in Bellevue ! ! !<->1
I 've been here at least 8 times and each time the food is the BOMB ! ! ! Cashew or Garlic Chicken , but never hotter than a 3 ! ! Great service too ! !<->1
Sushi rocks here . Order the Yellowtail Jalapeo . Restaurant design is exceptional . Love the newspaper stacked against the wall .<->1
Wonderful ! Sat at the bar to watch the cooking in action . The chef was pleasant and even let us taste the food he was prepping for later that week .<->1
We went on a Friday for dinner and everything was excellent ? The server recommended 3 plates each . We decided to split three which was a wise choice as they were huge ! Great service and atmosphere we will definitely be back .<->1
Wow ! We just tried this pizza for the first time and I can honestly say I 'm amazed ! ! ! It is so flavorful and packed with toppings and super cheap ! ! ! We just found our new pizza go to for sure ! ! !<->1

Great craft pizza . If your in the area do not miss this pizza restaurant . Service was also excellent .<->1
Fun festival . It was a great afternoon out . The performers onstage were the best part !<->1
OKAY , portions were small and overall ambiance just not what I expected . Lots of better options near the e 4th st area .<->2
This place is perfect ! Great food , great service and friendly people . We will be back over and over again ! We ordered a few different things on the menu and all were excellent ( Stetson chopped salad , scallops , testosterone salad ) . Lovvvve it !<->1
Hands down my favorite bar in Madison . Cozy atmosphere filled with some amazing souls and delicious food . Food is decently priced - $ 5 - $ 15 as well as daily specials that can knock off a few bucks .<->1
I do n't get the hype about this place . The waits are so long and the garlic sauce they use in the shawarmas tastes like goo .<->0
Come to the bar for amazing service with Mary , Henry & Josh . Great apps , an excellent beer selection & very cool ( potent ) masterful cocktails .<->1
Fantastic flavors and perfect cake ! Its hard to decide which ones to choose so we just keep goin back to try em all :)<->1
Yuck . Slimy salmon . Warm fish . Server not too interested . $ 102 later we are still hungry and do n't feel too good . Bummer .<->0
Having a great time at El Dorado enjoying Good food and Good music . Definitely will recommend you to come .<->1

Here in town for a bit and found this place ... Great venue and live music ! ! Waitress was great too ! 2 thumbs up !<->1
Went last night for dinner and geo was our chef , he was great and we had great entertainment and even better food . Service was good and Cindy even gave me a funny little birthday dance . We will be back for sure<->1
Great steaks , awesome service and comfortable settings . This is a steakhouse , do n't expect too much other then steakhouse classics and wonderful desserts . Food is good , not amazing , would return for sure .<->1
Open during Canada day weekend , I got my caffeine fill with a pretty latte art . Good way to start the day . Very smooth to the palette , just what I needed .<->1
Tasty ice cream but lack of seating and over the top poor service gives you 2 stars pink berry .<->0
The place is padlocked shut . Do n't bother arriving but from the reviews , it was bound to happen sooner than later . Closed .<->0
Must get the banana split ! Massive portions , old style , ice cream parlor . Love this place !<->1
So sad this place is no longer at El Cortez . New owners and name . Okay but I will definitely miss Pizza Lotto . It was so much more NY style . Pretty disappointed my favorite pizza place is closed .<->1
Great food and cook at your style ... Service is on point the ppl r on it ... Gen BBQ is the the place for a great meal thx to mizzo<->1
One of my favorite new spots . Great happy hour . Fire pits outside on the very large patio . Great place to take the family , hang with friends or entertain business clients and co - workers . Have n't had a bad experience yet .<->1
Delicious breakfast . Not traditional choices but absolutely perfect . Its s local cafe and the staff is so friendly . I d recommend it to anyone !<->1
Fast , friendly , and oh so easy . Tried their donuts of the month and their great . I like the peanut butter Reese 's square more though . Everyone is friendly and smiling I 'll be back for more in due time<->1
Excellent carne asada ! The tortillas are n't made there but are fresh tasting ! Lots of salsa choices . Very friendly staff . CleanExtremely affordable !<->1
Very good variety of food sections . The staff was attenative and available . I did not agree with the very small boneless wings compared to other wing type restaurants . I felt cheated with size of my meal .<->2
German Beer and food with a good view ; nothing more . Check in process is clumsy and awkward . You check in next to valet , and they give you no info about what is inside ( crowd , wait time , etc ) .<->0
Best Chinese in Charlotte . The service is also amazing ! We go any chance we can . Our usual order consists of their pan fried pork dumplings , fried spring rolls , pineapple rice , general tao chicken , and mongolian beef . OMG soGood !<->1
Humble atmosphere . Great to watch them make the pasties right in front of you . Good serving . Lots of choices .<->1
We stumbled in here right before closing . They were very welcoming . We ordered the spinach and potato soup , warm goat cheese salad , garlic bread , and the bologonse bucatini . Everything was delicious !<->1
I have hosted several events in their beautiful space and had happy hours . The manager , Chris and his staff are always so welcoming & accommodating . The food is always fresh and delicious !<->1
Had a blast down here on 5 de Mayo ! ! The food was great along with the ambiance . I ca n't wait to check the place out again !<->1
We were promptly seated on an early Saturday evening . Excellent attentive service . The menu offers an astounding array of options to choose from . We 'll be back !<->1
This place is always first on the list ! Ca n't go wrong with the boss and Sean the bartender always knows how to make the best drinks<->1
nice place , had blood sausage and pork soup . it was very tasty and portions are big .<->1
Clean , fast service . Nice it is away from the smoke . Had a patty melt , it was good . Had the coconut custard pie , it evoked a childhood memory . It was delicious !<->1
Délicieux . Bonnes portions . Service chaleureux et courtois . Toilettes propres et bien décorées . Le sandwich du midi aux boulettes de porc gingembre vraiment délectable . Prix raisonnable . Donne vraiment envie de revenir . Félicitations .<->1
Hour wait for a dine in pizza . At some point they have to tell pickup and delivery customers it 's going to a long wait and focus on the people sitting in their restaurant .<->0
I love this place . The food , service and experience are just as wonderful as Yelp is awful . Try the lemonade , fried chicken sandwich , lemonade and beets . Their lemonade is fabulous .<->1
Our first time here while at our annual staycation at the Westin Kierland . The vibe is energetic ! Burgers were great ! Loved the zucchini fries . We are planning lunch there tomorrow . Mmmmm<->1
Their dimsum is the best i 've tried in Vegas , especially the crabs . Prices are just right too .<->1
The food is pretty good :) we had the original chicken wing and pork belly . Yummy . Decent speed on the service but that 's what happens when the chicken comes out fresh from the fryer !<->1
I have eaten a lot and recomend to try it out portions are awesome Great food and place to eat very nice pastry staff friendly very clean nicely priced<->1
I mean it 's a little rough around the edges but I 've also never been to a breathtakingly nice Walmart . People are writing negative reviews but in all honesty , it 's convenient and has what you need .<->1
Ugh horrible first experience with take out . Only 2 customers in the whole place and very long wait for food even after calling in 20 minutes ahead . Food was marginal wo n't go back .<->0
So here is the deal , the owners are not the best customer services representives and the lunch buffet can be a hit or miss at times . however the pie is good when ordered fresh and they have cheap beers .<->2
Good prices by the slice ( $ 5 - 6 . 25 ) . New York styled pies with lots of flavor . Go easy on the jalapeños . They 're the spicy kind !<->1
James , Daniel , & Eddie Were Absolutely Great . Very Fast Friendly Service . I will definitely be back . Thanks Guys !<->1
Tried the Badger Cafe this morning for breakfast and we are sure to go back ! Food was great , prices were very reasonable , and service was A +<->1
Maybe I would go here more if the old people that frequented it were n't such assholes .<->2
Do n't let the location fool you . Food is really good and made fresh . You can tell they take pride in their food . We just found them on yelp , coming in from out of town .<->1
got the Frozzen Hot Chocolate to go ... taste exactly like rich hot chocolate ... but cold ! ! SO GOOD ! ! ! ... idk bout the small cup being $ 10 , and the large being $ 14 , ... but i m a sucker for it now !<->1
Great atmosphere - nice staff - great food ! Love the steak and cheese w tator tots or flatbread so yummy :)<->1
Excellent authentic Indian and Pakistani food . The owners are also down to earth and very caring . The Sheri Kebab , Briyani , Mutton Karahi are the dishes one could die for ... Awesome food<->1
What a great find in the Dilworth area for wine lovers . Great selection of wines , along with appetizers to pair . I will definitely be back soon !<->1
This is a hidden gem . Great food , excellent customer service and food came out within minutes . We will be back !<->1
20 minutes in the line and no sign of movement , at 10 am . What the hell ? ! Fortunately the cars behind us backed out of the line so we could bail . Never again at this location .<->0
So good ! Had the salmon with my salad . Quick and friendly service . Big selection . Will be back .<->1
Ordered take out from here . Food was amazing ! Everything taste wise was perfect and prices are reasonable . Crab Rangoon , spring rolls , pad Thai , crab fried rice . Generous portions and great flavor . No complaints . Looking forward to ordering from here again .<->1
In my forced gluten - free world , Rehab Burger is 1A , Smashburger is 1B . , but only by a nose . Since Smashburger is closer , I get their burgers more .<->1
Best Asian food in Vegas ! The fish , sake cocktails , atmosphere , and service are all amazing . They take large groups and the they take reservations .<->1
OMG ! So delicious ! 3 chicken tacos with chips and tomatillo salsa for $ 7 . What a deal ! Enjoy - you will not be disappointed .<->1
Nice , quiet place not far from Fremont Street . The food was excellent , and the service was prompt and genuinely friendly .<->1
Great service and I enjoyed the decor and atmosphere , but the food was just good , not great or spectacular . If they would drop their prices 20 - 30 % on all items I would be willing to come back .<->2
Always a favorite for my wife and I ! Big burritos and quesadillas and the salsas are phenomenal ! We truly enjoy them and the prices are very reasonable ! They put Chipotle to shame ! Try them out !<->1
The most important part about coffee shops to me is that they have good black coffee . And their black coffee is delicious . I had the light roast this morning and it 's so flavorful and not bitter at all . Thanks !<->1
Disappointed as smoked salmon bagel came with one tiny slice of salmon ! Does not look at all like the picture ! Not worth the money !<->0
On the plus side , they have Fresca on tap , and the restroom is open during the graveyard shift . The bad news is that I 've see one - hole outhouses out in the country better smelling than the men 's room .<->0
Love Fry 's Marketplace ! Great deals on everyday stuff<->1
Meh , their famous cold noodle is OK . Nothing really special about this place . The squid rice is way to spicy . Do n't think I 'll go back .<->0
First time here ! ! Loved it Great pulled pork sandwich and wonderful service ( Billy is wonderful ) Will be back soon<->1
Always hits the spot when I do n't know what I 'm hungry for . Food & service is great . Priced just right .<->1
We 've been coming since there grand opening . .. got ta love this place ... everything I 've tried has been delicious ... they have something for everyone . .. I can honestly say I already recommend this place and they all have loved it ..<->1
The food and service are always great . I love trying their sandwich special . If you prefer , they will make most items are a bowl instead . I definitely recommend their banana pudding !<->1
YUMMMMMMY ! My fave are the tiger , big island , and crunch roll . Happy hour is the best ! I 'm obsessed with this place .<->1
Awesome food and service ... nice small bar where everyone knows your name hahaha we had a great server and the sandwiches we had were great ... the patty melt and philly cheese steak ... sorry to say the chili was not great<->1
We stumbled upon this brewery by chance and what a pleasant surprise ! Their beers are great and the staff are super friendly . It 's not as crowded as the downtown breweries and the beers were great , my kind of spot !<->1
We have been coming here for years . This is my daughter 's favorite sushi restaurant . They always have great customer service and the sushi itself is fantastic .<->1
Great Service , Food + Drinks ... The late night menu is on point and so was the bartender , Kevin !<->1
Absolutely delicious Ice cold drinks , great portion of rosemary fries , and their pizza was amazing ! !<->1
I ordered a hanger steak and it came out undercooked as 3 tiny pieces of meat on a fancy plate . I 'm not stupid - I can tell I 'm being ripped off .<->0
Food was good , service was great for how busy it was . The Benny was decent . Great little place to stop in .<->1
Quick service , delicious food and a wide variety of vegan grocery items . Worth coming back for the salad dressing alone !<->1
did n't like the food but the service was amazing . the waiters were really warm and polite .<->1
The clam chowder was very unhealthily salty . Chicken slider is good . Place lighting too dim . A lot of fusion style food . Good for couples and families .<->2
Stopped by Bettis for a drink and dessert . Amazing carrot cake ! Great place , very hip !<->1
Left a review under my name as well . Just thinking about that Gyro and wanting to give you another five stars ! Absolutely delicious !<->1
Yummy meats n street corn restaurant style .. i love that the meats come from the restaurant 's family owned carniceria ! ! Love this place !<->1
Place is great Chinese food is good the only bad thing about this place is that the crab Rangoon has no crab in it just cream cheese .<->1
The best BBQ in Las Vegas . Every time I visit Buzz is the munchies ! Their BBQ sauce is to die for . You will not regret eating here .<->1
Had this food during the connecting flight . Over the next few hours , I had an upset stomach , bloated and diarrhea . This was the only thing I ate the whole morning . Horrible .<->0
The owner of this place told my friends and I to " Shut the f * * K up " after we each paid 9.00 for a sandwich with dry meat and stale bread . Very unprofessional .<->0
Wonderful food and service . We went there for our wedding rehearsal dinner a few months ago . Everyone had a great experience !<->1
I love this place ! ! ! Sushi was the best I 've ever had ! ! ! Yummmmmmm ! ! ! Wish I lived in Canada ... I would come here all the time ! ! !<->1
This is always our family original place to come and eat ever since we were kids no matter which location you go to it 's delicious and great , the people are friendly in the service is fast<->1
The food is so terrible for the price . I tried the octopus and ramen - oh man , I can make better tasting instant noodle than this<->0
Friendly , fast service ! Beautifully made dishes , indoor / outdoor seating , cool fixtures and massive bar . Very clean , and especially tasty food . Worth checking out !<->1
Service at this Denny 's was dismal . After waiting for 45 mins for breakfast at 10 am , the manager did n't even apologize for the food coming late . Food was mediocre . Location was pretty sketchy . Only go to this location if your desperate .<->0
This is my go to local establishment for some wings and a beer . All 3 Sams are nice guys . Bar mngr Sam strives to make sure you 're a repeat customer .<->1
Their smoked meat is one of the best in Montreal . It might take a while to get a seat and it 's slightly expensive . But the meal is great , everyone 's very friendly and the overall experience is entirely worth it .<->1
Great food , lots of veraities of putine so anyone will find something they like . The portions are big & our waiter was very nice . Combine that with the vibrant neighborhood the place is in & it 's a great choice<->1
Food is good , I liked the grill stuff but some of the veggie dish needs some more freshness , also naan need to less burnt and cooked thought out . Overall amazing<->2
Love this place ! Great Pancakes with Santa event - my dad gets breakfast here , my daughter gets ice cream , and a there 's fun grocery selection . We love the Peach Stand .<->1
Walked in was unsure about what to get when the chef said he 'd make up something special for me and the wife ... special could n't even begin to explain it ! ! Beyond words and flavors ... definitely will be coming back<->1
Best bakery ever . Everything I 've tried from here is great - particularly the lemon blueberry scone , which is one of the most delicious baked goods I 've ever had . Staff is always lovely . Yay Cobbs !<->1
We call location " Little Safeway " Has every thing I need and I do n't need to walk acres of floor to find find the foods I want . Staff is the friendliest in Phoenix .<->1
Delicious pizza , reasonable prices , nice ambiance and decent service . Enough said .<->1
Had chicken and waffles for breakfast . It was not good at all . When walk into place bunch empty tables , still had to wait 15 min for a table<->0
Ordered a Spanish latte . Zero foam and not hot enough . Not very good for its price . They were definitely rushing it . The location is convenient though .<->0
On the way to Sonic ... saw Bings and tried it . Excellent fresh - made - to - order burgers ! A large fry was more than enough for 2 - fresh & crispy . We will be back !<->1
I have never been so more addicted to Mexican food until now ! This is one of the few places where you will find a delicious good quality meal ( fastfood )<->1
Love the Kool - Aid and Shrimp and Grits ! Place is always clean and very taken well taken care of .<->1
Very convenient that you can make reservation on yelp . We ordered Chef selection . It is very fresh and yum . Reasonable price .<->2
Great place to eat , friendly staff , it truly reminds me of a New York diner the food is delicious my favorite is the Italian tour . I really recommend this dish .<->1
Still great ... organized . Reservation always ready . Well trained servers and chefs . We had ANOThER . B - day celebration here . Everyone loved their food . Consistently excellent<->1
My parents live close by and we all love their food ! We always get either a sandwich or calzone ( they call them fold overs ) Never had any issues with quality . And I actually LOVE their marinara dipping sauce ...<->1
The best ensenada style street tacos this side of the border . Way better carne asada , pastor and carnitas than any place in Phoenix . Give it a try you will not regret it .<->1
Was in Maui earlier this year and could n't get enough of these cookies . So happy to find a location in Vegas . And the clerk was super friendly . Mahalo .<->1
Food and beers are great . Service sucks ! ! ! Bartender is n't good enough to work alone . Wanted another beer but who has an hour to wait until she 's ready to notice an empty glass .<->1
By far the best sushi I have ever eaten . Better than Yoshi 's , better than Ezz Fusion .<->1
Occasionally the Chicken Katsu is really thin and a bit tough at a lot of places . Have n't had that problem at this location . Food is good , service is always friendly .<->1
So overpriced for the smallest portions .. food was not that great . The food seemed pre made since it came out within 2 min of ordering .. not fresh at all<->0
5 stars all the way ! I love coming here . They are always so friendly :) They never mess up my order . Very nice staff :)<->1
I am hooked on Bubbas . I was surprised at the amount of people waiting for a table . IT WAS WORTH THE WAIT ! Delicious tender Smokey meats . The staff is friendly too .<->1
love this fortino 's . Most grocery stores will cater to the neighbourhood where they are situated and this one is right in the heart of Woodbridge ... meaning , you can find great imported italian goods ! Great location , great variety of goods and excellent service !<->1
Horrible service , takes 20 + minutes for 4 cars to get through the drive through . Staff ca n't be bothered to even mix the blizzards all the way . Go to the one in River<->0
I have been coming here to get food . Their beef meat ball noodle soup is fantastic ! You can order the level of spicy you want !<->1
Sometimes you just want a big slice of pizza and sometimes it ca n't be kept a secret .<->1
Excellent breakfast ! Panko fried French toast , chai French toast , florentine egg benedict , homemade scones ...<->1
For the location : great service . Really good appetizers , solid food . No complaints but not blown away . I would recommend and I would come again<->1
First time here and this is the kind of ramen I like . Great taste of soup . Lunch combo is really good size .<->1
Been here many times over the past ten years - great food ! ! ! Best french toast , great breakfast , yummy cut meat sandwiches . Delicious lox - egg , etc .<->1
My favorite Filipino restaurant in Vegas , that 's all !<->1
Had a fabulous lunch . Very nice atmosphere and located in a very picturesque setting . I had the Red Raspberry Quinoa Salad for lunch and the homemade peach pie for dessert . Will definitely go back .<->1
Outstanding ! My husband and I ate there a few months ago and absolutely loved it ! Would eat there more often !<->1
It is hard to find good ramen in the east Valley , and this place is delicious . I highly recommend the pork gyoza and the tonkatsu ramen . I ca n't wait to come back and give the miso ramen a try .<->1
The burgers were excellent , though pricey , and the unusual decor was pretty cool . We went there because the name was intriguing and were n't disappointed .<->1
I 've been hard - pressed to find good Chinese food since I left Vancouver , but DAMN this shit was good . Repeat costumer from me for sure !<->1
Very good food I was pleasantly surprised , and seemed to be family run . I love to see a happy family working together .<->1
Just amazing . Best food ever . Awesome service and locally owned . Tons of vegan options . Ca nt get sick of this place .<->1
Very fresh sashimi and very good tepanaki . The service is excellent . The server ensure we were fed before they cooked the tepanaki . Will come back again .<->1
Bread is always nice and fresh ! Sandwiches are very consistent which is great . I 'm very happy there 's one in this area now<->1
The workers are fast but the tacos were n't that great . The guacamole was super mussy . And the meat was n't as seasoned as I thought . The hype about this place is n't worth it<->0
The Cajun shrimp tacos and crab cakes were delicious even though the BBQ is delicious we decided to venture out and were very pleased !<->1
They say they close at 12 am but we went in at 10:58 pm and they said they are not taking anymore customers . So disappointed ! ! !<->0
Meat Candy , was an enjoyable experience on a Sunday . The owner shared his passion for jerky much like if you were wine tasting . I look forward to going back and trying more of the flavors .<->1
Restaurant is in the Venetian hotel . All fried rices are the same taste . Everything is out priced .<->0
I had fun at the fireside lounge . We had a little bachelorette get together and it had a nice vintage vibe and even had a photographer going around and taking photos . Good times !<->1
They got 3 stars because ordering here is hit or miss even when you do it in person . Food is good when they get it right but the last couple of times I have ordered they completely got messed up .<->2
This place was great ! ! ! The service was the best part , but do n't get me wrong , the food is amazing , too . I 'd recommend the triple berry pancakes !<->1
Great place to get shot not shots . Closed for years and first night it reopens it hosts a hip hop night and the result is 3 people shot ! Avoid ! Should lose its liquor license and be shut down .<->0
Amazing food and customer service . I really love the sushi here but just wish they did n't have music at all . Everyone has different preferences .<->1
Good good , weird service never knew who my server was three different people took parts of our order but we got everything and they were nice .<->1
Awesome place and good coffee ! I always enjoy the staff ! Very nice place and always clean bathrooms<->1
Took my wife here for dinner . The food was great . It had a Japanese feel to it that was n't too much but have enjoyed . The food was delicious ! I highly recommend checking them out . Very filling .<->1
Pretty bummed with the recent change in ownership as the menu has been downsized and my previous favs are no longer on the menu . Not much of an HK style cafe anymore .<->0
Amazing amazing amazing . It is my go to burrito any day . Portions are big , service is fast . My favourite .<->1
Great car wash ! Reasonable and a secret gem that not many know about . I 'm usually in and out ! !<->1
Service is always slow and waiters not friendly . Service seems to be better on bar side . Have to clean dirty dishes off our table ourselves<->0
Sweet tomatoes has lots of great healthy options that never fail to leave me full but feeling great . Great place to go for lunch with friends and sit around sampling all the different soups , salads , pastas , breads , and desserts .<->1
Slowest McDonalds ever ! ! ! It 's just past dinner time and they ca n't get a Big Mac and fries out in less than 20 minutes<->0
Go there frequently . Clean , nice atmosphere . Great food at a reasonable price . Daughter and I usually have the Tamarind Currie Chicken . I usually have an Asian beer to suite the atmosphere .<->1
Great beers . Belgian and IPA are top notch ! Staff is friendly , informative . Neil is awesome . Thank you .<->1
Stopped in on the way through vegas and were surprised at the excellent food . The sashimi was amazing , the presentation beautiful , and the service was quick and friendly .<->1
Great spot for a healthy salad ! I got a salad with chicken and the creamy dressing . They use all fresh ingredients and the meat was very tender ! I will be returning<->1
Excellent service and food . Crabcakes and scallops were top - notch - expect small portions<->1
Awesome place , way cool vibe , really great specials every day ( check their Facebook page ) , and CASEY is AMAZING ! ! !<->1
HUGE PORTIONS my Girlfriend and I always split there omlettes . Try the banana bread instead of the toast . Good prices for great quality .<->1
I love the grocery store . The best skirt steak . Make sure you get it marinated and add the homemade guacamole .<->1
Been here twice and both times have been excellent . Champagne sampler and the Rosarito . Great start to a Sunday morning<->1
Honestly just a ok place . Nothing was bad , but nothing stood out . The one thing I did lol was the amount of protein they gave you in each dish . Other then that , just standard fare .<->2
Great ambience and awesome food . Rogan josh and saag were one of the best in west coast .<->1
Great inexpensive family style dining Chinese food . Specials price point menu with many family style Chinese favorites categorized by $ 4.95 , $ 5.95 , $ 6.95 , $ 7.95 . Free bowl of house soup and rice with this option .<->1
Really cool hipster atmosphere . I was a little put off by the moody exterior but the inside was spacious and well lit . Wood everything . The coffee was decent .<->1
Excellent Italian meal ! Pasta was perfect Al dente . Eggplant appetizer was superb . Home made limoncello , cake was light and creamy . Enjoyed our meal at bar table at the window . Highly recommend<->1
Delish , , less creamy than Pittsford Dairy in Rochester , NY but better , as it was easier to digest .<->1
You can never go wrong when it comes to the quality of Capriotti 's sandwiches . Excellent customer service , food is prepared in a timely manner and it tastes great !<->1
Very bad service ! Very bad food ! Dumbness waitresses I 've elver encountered ! Double check your bill before you pay coz they 'll charge extra for something that you did n't order .<->0
Good spot . Only con is that there s always these people outside Walgreens trying to sell you drugs<->2
Took my 2 best friends today instead of my usual party of 11 + everything was exceptional and they also had a new coconut cream puff that looked like challah !<->1
So Disappointed about the waiter here , when he required me to give 10 % minimun for tip . Never come back<->0
First time there , late valentine 's celebration . Food was great , atmosphere great , and our waitress Jenna was a sweetheart .<->1
went here for lunch tried rudys across the street and these guys were def a tad bit better . will def come here again the bbq is to die for ! highly recommend<->1
Great Food with even better service ! ! ! I ca n't think of a better place to get authentic tacos than at the Border Grill . Their $ 20 Monday all you can eat Tacos are simply amazing .<->1
Very nice bar ! ! ! Belle ambiance ! ! ! Vraiment conviviale<->1
Friendly service .. but there is nothing more aggravating then getting home and not having any sauce for your chicken nuggets .. i mean its real simple .. you take orderSomeone prepares the food . You place order in bag ..<->0
Just got home from dinner at Noodlehead , and ca n't wait to go back ! The Pig Wings are awesome ! ! !<->1
Great breakfast and dinner options . Service in my experience has always been fantastic . If your road weary and do n't want to leave the Hilton Garden downtown .. this is a great option<->1
This Starbucks always delivers - friendly staff and for $ 4 you get a good latte , what else can you ask for ?<->1
For my fellow vegans out there , they have a small vegan menu ( for now ) but what they have is sooo delicious ! Definitely recommend eating here . They are very nice and make things fresh !<->1
Stopped in for the first time today . Great Americano and relaxed atmosphere . Definitely recommend and will return again .<->1
So good I almost wish I lived further away . Love the selection of mayo . They only do a few things , but they do them excellently .<->1
Menu was unique and different . Prices seemed just a tad high for most of the fare . Food quality was above average . My only dig is the value .<->2
I do n't understand why this place got four stars or higher . Nothing amazing about it . Some of the donuts had an odd flavor . If your in a donut shortage , they will do !<->2
The food here is really good but what I like the most is the authentic Thai atmosphere that you do nt get at Archie 's ( My other Favorite Thai restaurant ) . They have a pictures of the royal family in Thailand ... Nuff Said ! ! !<->1
Love this place .. Great brunch spots with a nice atmosphere . I highly suggest checking this spot out to see for yourselves .<->1
Best chicken in town . Their chicken is moist and soft . The skin got some crisp and smokey smell . I ordered my chicken to be very spicy and it 's great .<->1
The hostesses are not the best kinda feel it 's a bother you even walked in . But Diego our server was great fast friendly and good . I 'm happy we got his section .<->2
This is a good alternative to A Piece Of Havana , they are both about the same when it comes to quality , and service .<->1
Wow . Drove from Cincinnati for research and had a taco trio . Strong . Al pastor and her chicken magnificent . Avocado fries were a delicious start .<->1
So so . Better than the other chain pizza places in Buckeye .<->2
Amazing New American dining experience in Cleveland . Wonderful , friendly and warm service , delicious nuance of flavors and freshness in everything served . Gracious from beginning to end . Highly recommended .<->1
Too pricey , not that tasty . $ 13 for a mediocre grille cheese sandwich , ok chips and a tiny bottle of coke . I may possibly go back but not any time soon .<->0
Love the carne asada burrito . This place offers a great assortment o Mexican style food with a bit of a twist . A definite must try if you are in the area .<->1
This is a great place to take your kids / family . Fun for all safe place , great drinks , pool tables ... and toys . We really like it .<->1
Great food , huge portions , reasonably priced . Love this Mexican restaurant . It 's too busy Friday and Saturday nights .<->1
Specialty pizzas are great provided that the kitchen staff does not burn the crust . The smoked beet salad is a hit . And the French fries ? NEVER miss ordering those things !<->1
The food is good like you 'd expect from In - N - Out . The staff at this location is incompetent usually forgetting to put napkins or forks with the order .<->2
I ve been coming here for quite awhile now . I like the ambiance and the selections they have . Very clean and very friendly chefs and waitresses .<->1
Great food . Great customer service . Very speedy . We will be back ! Best chinese food in the area .<->1
I go at least once a week . My favorite is the Panzanella Salad , best in the city by far .<->1
Excellent food , service , and value . We ordered for family size items party of about 20 guests , everyone loved it and we even had leftovers . Highly recommended for large groups or just an awesome Chicago style pizza .<->1
Nice diner atmosphere , good food and service . I get the natural burger a lot . A bit pricey but if u can spend 10 $ on a lunch try it once .<->1
Tasty milk teas but very stingy on the actual tea . 75 % of the drink was ice . Sorry but for $ 5 it 's a rip off .<->0
Food is well made , but not exceptional gourmet , so I can not see the high price justification , especially when the portions are small . I also find a lot of discrepancies in their menu prices - so be aware of the charges .<->2
You ca n't go wrong with the dessert here . It 's always delicious , the portions are big . Whichever desserts you choose , they are all good , rich and very satisfying .<->1
Great stuffed pepper app . Megan was awesome and called us a car service . Out of town but felt at home in this clean and friendly place .<->1
Comes with 10 side items + Free noodle refills . Totally worth it for $ 8.49 . I work close by and it 's the perfect place to have some warm and hearty soup .<->1
The owner is a really great guy and fun to talk to . The food is unique , delicious , and authentic . A true taste of Yemen . Highly recommended<->1
AMAAAAAAAAZING ! ! ! The BEST restaurants in Vegas . Beautiful atmosphere and great staff ! Please try the market oysters , new york strip and scallops . One of the best meals I have ever had . Everything was made to perfection .<->1
Diet Coke - This business is not closed I eat here all the time . They normally do a great job . Not sure why it is marked the way it is . I am literally eating here right now<->1
We are new to the area just bought our condo coming from NY . Food was great and great selection of brews ! Staff was very friendly and helpful ! Will definitely be returning with our guide dogs . Felt very welcomed .<->1
This place was really fun . The bar is limited but the drinks they do have are very tasty . It is like a Playland for adults . Food was fantastic .<->1
Not bad for a 24 hour joint , fast service but the food was only worth 2 stars at best ... Definitely will NOT be coming back ... ! ! ! Dirty tables & floors ... !<->0
My co workers and I are big fans . Most dishes we 've had have been great , though the turkey burger was only meh .<->1
Food was good but not great , service was what is expected . I had hopes for something more spectacular for the price but overall not bad .<->2
$ 2 FOR AN ICE CREAM SANDWICH . Guys ! You get to pick your cookies , you can mix and match . Then you pick your ice cream ... it 's that simple .<->1
Moo & Brew was pretty good , I was n't blown away by any standards . I do have to say , their beer selection is incredible - but the burgers were ok . The size was mediocre for the price , but the beer was delicious .<->2
Ordered a pizza online through my mobile which was seamless . Pizza was delicious . Will be back again .<->1
I was seated promptly at the bar . We ordered oysters Florentine , Crab cakes and a seafood pasta dish . Waitress was pleasant , food was delicious .<->1
Good selection of Asian and other ethnic foods . Store was kinda stinky and it would be nice to see some Croatian products since they seemed to have every other country there !<->2
Main attraction is the crab legs . Unfortunately they were way too salty . Actually , most of their meats are way too salty . Selection of food is n't to die for . Overpriced in my honest opinion .<->0
Wow ! ! A taste of Chicago in Las Vegas , awesome food beef , Chicago dogs , Italian beef , pizza puff n fries :) Great flavor in a family owned business . They have a chicago themed diner .<->1
Great ice - cream at a reasonable price . I love their chocolate banana milkshake .<->1
I have been here for several times because it close to my house , and I always try different meals , their meals really surprise me , tasty and value for money , definitely will come often ! !<->1
Taste of the food is the best around but $ 8 for a burrito smaller than my cell phone ? No thanks<->2
Amazing food , service is a bit slow because it 's always packed , which is probably a good thing !<->1
Excellent ! If I lived in Phoenix , I would consider driving here for dinner . The sauce bin the carnitas had great flavor and texture .<->1
This is probably my favorite please to go this far .. the food is super tasty and hits all the right taste buds in my mouth .. delicious<->2
Oh my gosh , where to begin went Sunday night and the service was awesome David and Sylvia took care of us all the staff was great . The food was excellent . If I lived here this would be it for me .<->1
My family and I love this place ! Great food ! ! ! Amazing service ! The best sushi place in town and reasonable prices . Love it !<->1
Great spot , have to be 21 plus on taco Tuesday . Cheap but amazing tacos and great service and friendly staff .<->1
Ok , lack fresh flavors they promise . I am sure at one time this was the shit conceptually . Now it is uninspired and running on fumes . Good service but flat food . Bar looks sad<->2
Lots of great dishes for breakfast , I had Mama 's French toast & it was very tasty ! Friendly & fast service !<->1
I have been here 2 - 3 times now , I do n't live far . But , every time friends come in and visit we go here for lunch . I had a burger , was very good . Prices were n't too bad either , service was great !<->1
I drove by Gus 's for years . I tried it out approximately four months ago and now I 'm a fan . Well managed , good staff and good , inexpensive food .<->1
Ambiance was awesome , the neo soul music made for a very relaxing environment , food was great and so was the service ! ! ! My new spot !<->1
Firefly ... there is no substitute for this place . Bacon wrapped dates , Sangria , Tuna tartare , filet skewers ... this place never disappoints . Be sure you say hi to Athena at the bar - she rocks .<->1
AMAZING . Hands down some of the best Mexican food I 've had in a long time . Super quick , and friendly staff . Do n't miss this place .<->1
Great breakfast spot in Vegas . Huge menu , nice staff . If you want to escape the casinos for meal this is a very nice option .<->2
My first trip here but it was worth the wait . My colleague and I enjoyed the Chicken Greek and Peppered Steak . Service was quick even on a busy Friday !<->1
Tasty avocado smoothies , and reasonable prices . I had great customer service and my smoothies came up very quickly . I am eager to try some of their other fruit smoothies .<->1
This was the first time I have been there , admittedly it was quiet . But the food and smoothie were really good . I would recommend this place .<->1
Pho King is the best restaurant in Las Vegasfood was good with awesome service we love it ! Will come back next time definitely .<->1
Decently priced food and fast delivery , but I just ... was n't crazy about the taste . There are much better Chinese places that deliver , so i would opt for Grand China or something else .<->2
The prices were very reasonable , and the steaks were cooked just as advertised . All the orders were correct , unlike some of the other reviewers ' experiences . Our server were very attentive .<->1
Cool place with great food ! Rachel at the bar was amazing and makes one of the best micheladas I 've ever had I 'll definitely be returning ! !<->1
Mindblowingly great food . Everything is delicious . The combo soup is my favorite , but everything I 've ordered has been outstanding . My new favorite restaurant in Cleveland .<->1
Getting my donut on . ! Nice little place glad i finally stopped . Go check them out so many choices .<->1
Neighborhood spot with great , homemade food . The french dip was incredible as were the ribs . Looking forward to coming back to try the burgers which looked amazing . Only improvements I 'd like to see are more local draft options<->1
I Enjoyed this place Much Better than Dennys I 'm Glad I came Here Nice Music and The Food was Awesome . I Shall Return when I 'm in Town<->1
The donuts and brownies are delicious . The staff is amazing and friendly . Our office orders from Carl 's and the employees gobble it up quickly .<->1
Great to have a place open 24 hours .. Especially a sonic . Food was hot and fresh .. Would be a 5 star review but my vanilla bean milkshake tasted like cake batter to me !<->1
I had a custom build it yourself lamb and beef , extra spicy Doner and fries . The owner was there and he is super friendly and explained all our options . Meat was fresh cut off the spit ! Ca n't wait to return .<->1
Pulled pork , dragon ( beef ) , and chicken tacos were amazing and well priced ! They are prepared with a layer of rice under the meat and toppings .<->1
As always the food was deliciious and the service was excellent . We had entrees and small plates and all were cooked to perfection .<->1
It 's great beer here , atmosphere is good and food is just OK . Love the beer selection , and service is good as well .<->1
Plywood now covers the door . No more canned sauce . The world is a better place .<->0
They have the best Las Vegas roll and the vibe is very mellow . They also have fast and friendly service . Definitely coming here again .<->1
This place absolutely rules . I got the man vs food favorite and it was the breakfast of dreams<->1
A little out of the way but absolutely worth it ! I love home made ice cream with fun favors ... Red pepper chocolate , lucky charm ice cream .<->1
My favourite sushi place in Calgary ! ! ! 10/10 would recommend .<->1
I could have sat at this bar all night simply for their choice in music . Yeah yeah yeahs ... Spoon ... Imagine dragons ... Just a cute little bar within walking distance to our hotel .<->1
Great food , great service . If you have n't been to Burgatory yet , you 're missing out on the best burger ( and shake ! ) in the burgh .<->1
Worst , slowest mcdonalds ever . Shake machine has been broken for 4 years . Waiting in drive thru right now . It 's taking so long I have time to craft an entire yelp review on how bad it is .<->0
I needed lunch in 15 minutes or less and I ordered , stuffed my face with a Turkey Tom , and was on my way back to the office in 10 minutes . Freaky Fast indeed .<->1
Solid service from Larry Legend , will be back . Burger was huge , Sonoran white chocolate and orange blossom on tap !<->1
Never been here and it is awesome . Employees are great and super willing to help explain and suggest dang good foodies ! ! ! Totally coming back .<->1
Meatballs were fantastic , service was great , the rest of the menu was good but in general too salty .<->2
Called for delivery ordered fish and shrimp combo and I got popcorn shrimp and a piece of chicken ! ! ! Very disappointing because I do n't eat chicken ! The Rice is dry and bland what happened to you ? ? ?<->0
Always good service and huge selection of beer . Disappointed they took firestone double barrel out of the bar ... But not the fault of the bartenders ... Ask for Brad at the bar he 's friendly and a good bartender .<->1
The baba is the best in town . If you 're unsure what to get , try the Business Lunch Special , a little bit of everything .<->1
Not bad . The prime rib was over cooked but otherwise was good . Great variety and especially liked the fresh guacamole with plenty of cilantro . Service staff was very attentive and great deserts including gelato .<->2
Really good food ! Sandwiches made any way I want it . Very fresh and yummy . The cookies are soooo good and soft . Customer service was great !<->1
Man , do you have to get the pastrami ! It is divine ! Their desserts are good too . Lovely service and convenient downtown location . Recommended .<->1
Went there on Wednesday for 1/2 wine bottles . Food was great ! Fabulous little house and location on east . Great atmosphere .<->1
Beautiful place for a dinner date , my wife and I both loved it . The atmosphere and decor very sophisticated . Staff was superior and well trained and always there . Food was good fare very well balanced sauces and great rice .<->1
Hands down they have the best cheeseburgers in town . I mean for this to be a vegan place I 'm just impressed how amazing the food is . I try different things but I 'm hooked on the cheeseburger .<->1
great quality food and sushi at an affordable price . interior design is very classy . I highly recommend the special roll " snow corn "<->1
This is our favorite restaurant in Scottsdale . So glad they 're opening another one in the Promenade . Everything is so fresh and tasty . Ca n't recommend highly enough . Could eat here every day !<->1
The food is fantastic , the service is equally good , and the prices are good too . We go there all the time and every experience has been great . One of the best restaurants around . Everything about it is 5 stars .<->1
The taste is very good . However , I only spend around 12 dollars and the staff asked me for ID . I do n't think everyone should present their ID in this crowded store .<->0
Been here a few times for business meetings or when guests are in town . Service is always quick and friendly ( and sometimes funny ! ) and the food is great . I love the salmon and the kobe beef burgers .<->1
Um , yes . This place is awesome . They have like 2349248 1 different flavors , which is AWESOME . And this would mean nothing if the yogurt did n't taste very good , but it is delicious ! Highly recommend this place . :)<->1
I have been a Gordon Ramsay fan for a long time and my visit to his restaurant solidified that . The staff was very attentive and the food was exceptional .<->1
Marisa Cluff killed it again with the serving ! We love coming to Postino ! Everyone is so friendly and the wine and bruschetta are amazing<->1
It 's okay for all you can eat there not a lot of options ... after our first round they asked us if we were done lol . I ' did n't like it I would n't go back<->0
I had wings today with a teriyaki source , and it was the worst chicken wings I have ever had in my life . The chicken was burnt as the source was too .<->0
Las Vegas poke bawl spot . Good food , great service . The rodendo bawl was great . Size was just right for lunch<->1
Stopped by hoping for dinner but the lights were so bright in the restaurant we decided to go else where . I 'm guessing they 're confused about the difference between dinner and diner . Will try them for lunch next time .<->0
We like Remington 's . Great food and service . Live vintage jazz in the bar . With an age appropriate group it is quite enjoyable . We have been here 2 or 3 times a year since 1998 .<->1
? ? ?<->0
Great food ! Always delicious and filling . Love coming here !<->1
Drove all the way out here for crab legs . None to be found ... Mangament told me to pound sand food was ehhh customer service can get f * cked tho .<->0
Yum the great steak n coney fries - ca n't go wrong ! They were out of ice tea which saddened me , had to order soda which I hate to drink .<->1
Great authentic addition to champaign . Dario and Alessio have done an incredible job and I ca n't wait to go back again and again !<->1
I usually stay at the aria when visiting Vegas . I always make it a priority to stop by at Javier 's at least once during my time in Vegas . Their service is consistently great and their food never disappoints !<->1
Overall it is pretty good . The food artistry was average and and the overall quality was decent . The service , unfortunately , was slow with only about 50 % of the seats filled . That being said the staff was very pleasant .<->2
Always great service . Wonderful food great drinks and great atmosphere . I love CUNY day here every time<->1
The spring rolls are cheap and tasty . My favorite is the Spider Roll , which has soft shell crab . They have Pho , sandwiches and salads . They also have a bar .<->1
Service was excellent and I 've never been so wowed by halibut before . A really nice intimate night out for our anniversary , perfect .<->1
This place is always busy but finding parking is never a problem . They have lots . We are doing some renovations and found everything we needed for our new bathrooms . Will be back again soon .<->1
This is our new favorite restaurant . We absolutely loved the mussels . Our entire meal was Fantabulous ! ! ! Five stars with no question ! Our bartender Kat was friendly , attentive , and had great recommendations .<->1
Excellent food and dining with friendly and courteous staff . A very modern and unique atmosphere that feels open and visually appealing . A trendy facility located in the heart of the city with a fantastic menu .<->1
Best pizza place in Madison , with good nutrition in their food , along with the deliciousness everyone loves . This place also has great service and keeps the place clean .<->1
Can never go wrong with eggs Benedict , I 've never tried a vegetarian style before and it was actually very delightful on my appetite and health :)<->1
Bland and sludge - like mush all rolled up in a toasted tortilla . In fact , the best thing I could say about it was how neatly the cook packed and folded my chicken burrito .<->0
Excellent food ( we are organic in our home as well ) , friendly staff and very accommodating ( we have food allergies ) . We 'll be back here every time we come to Vegas .<->1
Great little joint . Pizza was a bit late but understandable considering a small , friendly staff and the phone ringing off the hook . I may try delivery because the charge and tip make it worthwhile to not leave my couch ! ! !<->1
Do nt see why everyone likes this place got a chicken and steak burrito they were both cold and not good at all rice was way under cooked very crunchy . Not worth the 6.25 each .<->0
Omg ! ! ! This place is great my mother and I love their green enchiladas they are to die for , chips and salsa are made fresh ! Love them<->1
Awesome food , view and service . Great special occasion meal and dining experience . Make reservations and tip the maitre d ' upon arrival for a nice table with a great view .<->1
Had the veggie benedict and the biscuit and gravy . Perhaps we ordered the wrong this . I was not impressed with the quality of the ingredients or the way they were put together .<->2
Great food , long wait times . This place is very romantic . When you walk in there is a nice gas fireplace and a beautiful bar . When you can find a seat it is a great place to go :)<->1
Probably the most authentic chinese food you can find in Pittsburgh . My menu favs include : Pork and Preserved Egg Congee , Cold Chicken , and young pea sprouts .<->1
Pretty good but I did n't find it amazing . Very creative and new aged ideas . Maybe it was an off day . Either way it 's definitely good ice cream I guess we had higher expectations ?<->2
Over priced for small servings of food . But the food is delicious , the patio is great in the evenings or the winter , and the ambiance overall is nice .<->2
My go - to place when I 'm craving a vanilla chai . Great atmosphere and very friendly staff .<->1
Get bacon with whatever you order here . They have some high end , fresh made bacon that is next level . Wings , burgers , sandwiches , pretty much everything is good . A huge step above regular bar food !<->1
We were in Italy last summer and have n't found pizza that tasted like true Italian until this one . We had the green salad and Marghetia pizza . Both were amazing . Definitely a winner !<->1
My new favorite spot ... been looking for a while ... and will definitely be a regular here ... service a little off but food totally makes up for it ...<->1
It 's pretty decent as far as banh mi goes . I wish the bread had more of a crunch . Other than that , they have a pretty big sandwich for the cheap price .<->1
great burgers , good price , they take there time to buy great products , at a fair price . it 's a hiiden gem<->1
Awesome music on Fri amd sat.nigjt . a fun energy in the pub . rhere wine is.perfectly chilled and delicious cornbeef .<->1
Ate here today for lunch based on the high reviews . I had the italian sub and it was average . Staff was friendly but food average ... at least the sandwich I had was . I prefer Mr . Goodcents over this .<->2
Best Asian Cusine that I have found in AZ . Love the crab ragoons , sizzling rice soup and every entree I have had . The meat is not mystery meat , like some Chinese restaurants , but great quality .<->1
Qué cosa tan más deliciosa de desayuno ! ! El lugar padrísimo , y el servicio de lo mejor<->1
Best frozen yogurt in town . The staff is super friendly and the prices are better than most .<->1
Clean , frendly and good menu . Breakfast all day . Second Saterday is 1/2 off all crepes . Yumm .<->1
NOT only did they entirely screw up our order , they do not answer the phone , missing items . HORRIBLE PLACE . DO NOT GO ! ! ! this has happened countless number of times . I am done with this place .<->0
This place gas a great atmosphere . The staff are very attentive and friendly . Excellent panang curry dish . Very fresh and full of flavor .<->1
Love this place . I had chicken salad on sprouted wheat . Delicious . Chicken salad was not typical but fresh and satisfying . My friend had the white bean soup and said it was great . I will return .<->1
I am big fan of this place . Food is amazing , price is really fair for such an environment and decoration and service is fine .<->1
Since they have merged with bachi burger everything has gone downhill . Do n't go unless you want to wait for a long time and not get seated when there were open tables available . Waiters constantly let people ahead of us .<->0
This place is officially my new favorite place in Las Vegas . Staff is very helpful , and the selection is amazing . A must stop for grill heads like myself .<->1
Nice place to eat , staff is really nice and friendly , good food at a great price , will defenitly come back again<->1
As one who grew up in Ytown ( gone 36 years ) glad to find Handel 's while on vacation . Ice cream was awesome . Next trip this will be my first stop from the airport .<->1

Awesome Roti ! What a little gem ! Not greasy and super tasty , highly recommend getting the hot sauce !<->1
Symposium is great addition to the town of Stouffville . We visit this restaurant periodically with family and have always been very happy with the service , food , and atmosphere .<->1
I went to dinner with friends , the eggplant with chicken is yummy , , , it comes with the white rice , , , very deliouse ... I will definitely come back again ...<->1
Average food . Breakfast is good , but how hard is that . Great spaceVery clean Nice decorGreat locationExpensiveBelow average service .<->2
Went there with my kid , and we all got sick the next day . This place is not maintain . And the kitchen looks disgusting .<->0
Amazing and creative foods + lovely ambiancePlease note the meals are smaller than you expect :D<->1
Our dinner was delicious . Loved the atmosphere , felt like I was having dinner at my grandmas house . Everyone was very friendly . Will definitely be going back .<->1
Everything was good . Eggs are cooked with care , the meat is quality ... French toast and croissant egg sandwich were pretty delicious . Solid breakfast place by an established family .<->1
This place has some bubonic chronic tacos that made me choke shiiiii . Just messing around and referencing an old school Snoop Dogg song . Great burritos , tacos and service ..<->1
This place is the real deal for good home style authentic Italian ! The Lasagna is amazing ! We order the Garlic Knots every time we come and the service is outstanding !<->1
Always delicious ! The servers are always friendly and the place is very clean . We love the asparagus role and awesome lunch specials !<->1
The burgers are ok , the cheese fritters are awesome , the fries are gross , basically soggy oil .<->0
I found there selection to be very average . There sausages are good and vertical tasty but not much to choose from . Better selection in a large grocery store . I would n't recommend it<->2
Great food had the Tag Pic Pac with shrimp . Very good and reminds me of what real Italian pasta is . Light sauce with lots of flavor .<->1
The friendliness of everyone we have meet is beyond Hoosiers so far . And Poutine ! I 'm sold .<->1
Excellent sushi at a great price ! Some of the freshest and best sushi in the West Island with plenty of great selection on the menu . If you like sushi then this place is a must - try . We 'll definitely be going back .<->1
Had the best steak and grilled asparagus . I had to special request my food be cooked without oils . My only complaint was the food arrived at different times .<->1
Great food . We had the veggie sandwich , salmon sandwich and the caprese . All ingredients were fresh . Delicious .<->1
Best chicken burgers here ! Can be a little pricy but the food and service is always good .<->1
Great place to eat with a marvelous beer selection . The food is homemade and delicious . The staff are welcoming and friendly . I have been here to eat many times and I have never been disappointed .<->1
This is the best fish taco ever for me ! We tried San Diego famous fish taco and other fish taco but it 's the best fish taco ever . They also serve great Horchata ! You should try that too !<->1
Very good customer service , friendly staff . Offered samples when we were unsure what to order . Food tasted great , good serving sizes .<->1
The Godzilla deal can not be be beaten ! 2XL , 3 toppings each for $ 19.99 ! Perrrrrrrfect , easily feeds a family of 5 - 7 ! Fresh toppings , yummy pizza sauce , tastiest crust ! Five stars for you !<->1
This place has to be some of the best food I have ever eaten . The owners & staff are always accommodating making sandwiches that are n't even on the menu . Give this place a chance and it will not disappoint !<->1
Vovomeena has great food and a friendly staff . The food is very reasonably priced for the quality .<->1
Too loud to talk with friends or family . Food is good though . I would n't go here for a date because of the noise .<->0
Best chicken and waffles I ve had . The Mac and cheese is to die for . Lolos is by far better then roscoes in LA .<->1
Vegan friendly . We got the Super Food Wrap and the Hot Veg Out sandwiches and they were excellent . And the owner is very friendly . We will be back .<->1
Good sushi ! ! The place is located on a very quiet , kindda ghetto part of Fremont but the sushi is excellent .<->1
This has to be one of my favorite places to eat breakfast . A must visit ! Love the biscuits and gravy and the creamy chipped beef on toast , although I get it on biscuits . Very cute and friendly waitresses .<->1
Usually - they should have 4 stars . Today I order the Asian Chicken Soup that was ... average ( disappointed for me at THiS place ) . It was worm instead of hot , and " just average not exited nor " good " or " very good " soup<->2
Backyard taco one of our favorite places to go . If u crave Mexican food go here you 'll thank me later after your first bite . You 'll probably get addicted , I 'm not sorry you 're welcome for making your life better ;)<->1
Solid crepes , they seem like they 're still settling in to their new space . I 'm sure this will be one of the best Crêpe spots in town though !<->1
I have eaten here consistently and their food is very good . Great deals on appetizers from 3 - 6 . For the money you get great food .<->1
I m new in town & thought I would try Glass Nickel for pizza delivery . Service was excellent and so was the pizza ! It 's my new favorite place !<->1
Ordered the Chicken Parmesan and the Tortelloni Bellagio . The sauce over the Bellagio is super flavorful and their house marinara is legit . So glad we found this place in our backyard . We will definitely be back .<->1
Great atmosphere , good food , great service . Portion sizes were good and the apps delivered as expected . great happy hour spot ...<->1
the Crispy Cashew Tofu is the BEST.IN.THE.WORLD ! worth the trip just to get this dish ! the chef learned it from her aunt who was the personal cook for the Royal family in Thailand years ago .<->1
Great staff . Best PT 's in town . Very friendly staff and good enough food to be a stand alone restaurant . Thank you PT 's ! !<->1
Had the pumpkin ale with brown sugar on the rim . Got the marinara and goat cheese dip which was incredible .<->1
The food is great ! Best place to eat Chinese food / pho in all of vegas . Great service and very good prices . I always come here to eat when I 'm in Vegas !<->1
Came here for drinks on a Sunday evening . Drinks ( Caesars ) were horrible had to send them all back . Tasted like watered down tomato juice .<->0
We had a wonderful experience . Our server was Andrea and her recommendations were spot on . Best service ever .<->1
Very good burgers ! ! The food court takes away from 50 ' s feel of other locations . The portion sizing could be better , but overall a great place to grab a good burger !<->1
Came here following yelp suggestion , with a colleague , both exhausted but hungry . Service was kind , place clean and hospitable . Food was fresh and tasty , not too greasy and not sweet ! Price were very reasonable . Will come back if i 'm in the neighborhood !<->1
I 've never had better pizza . Came through for a graduation looking for a quick bite to eat . Service was quick , pizza was crunchy , very flavorful , and delicious . I 'd definitely come here again if I 'm back in town !<->1
This restaurant was pretty good and better than I expected . I want with my husband for happy hour and dinner . The price was reasonable and the ambience inside was nice . I would go back there recommend for a date .<->1
Really good breakfast and really good waitstaff . Fun writing on the wall . Servings are huge , fun environment<->1
The line was long , the hamburger was very greasy . Almost all of our party had stomach aches within one hour . Would not go again .<->0
Great place . Food tasty and fresh . Amazing shawarmas . Friendly staff . No disappointments . Highly recommended .<->1
Villa Pizza is one inviting place for the family . Other than delicious pizza and italian food , children can play table games with friends , family or parents . Amazing atmosphere !<->1
Food was good . Less option on the vegetarian dishes ( no meat ) . We had ordered fried tofu , vegetable spicy soup and vegetable fried rice . All the dishes were moderate .<->2
Best donuts in town ! ! ! Amazing drinks and service ! Definitely the place to be if you want the best quality donuts<->1
Not even a good morning - - - employees not even engaging with customer - left 17 minutes away just fine a good place<->0
This place is tons of fun ! Strap on a bib , don some gloves and dive into the crab legs . Carol is the best - ask for her !<->1
small portions . crazy small portions . stick to the buffet because at china poblano , the food did n't taste very good . and it was grossly overpriced . i will never return . NEVER ! EVER . EVER !<->0
Not your typical airport food ... this was a welcome relief to a frequent travelers palate . Highly recommended if you have a few $ $ ' s leftover from your travels and a layover ! !<->1
Killer atmosphere , great staff and even better guacamole . Will definitely be a go to any time I 'm in Scottsdale !<->1
Love this place ... They have the best kimchi of all the Korean restaurants in the valley ... in my opinion . I really enjoy their spicy chicken bulgogi . I hope they can keep the doors open for a long time .<->1
The brunch ( $ 39 / pp ) was quite good . I enjoyed the bacon , eggs benedict , smoke salmon , salmon scramble eggs , steel cut oatmeal , cheese plate , donuts and the guava watermelon juice ! Parking : Valet only .<->1
Personally my experience was awesome , the food is really good , they does n't have a lot of wines for be a place with an Italian name and serves pasta , the wine 's menu is not so extended .<->1
Great atmosphere with the friendliest staff you 'll find . Juice is pricey - but worth every cent . Small - so do n't expect a lot of seating . 49th parallel coffee for sale . Highly recommended !<->1
I highly recommend Pomegranate Café . The food is delicious and the people who work there are nice .<->1
Great patio with an excellent view . Apps were excellent and service also excellent . Very nice place .<->1
The breakfast buffet was amazing ! ! ! Everything was great . The best I 've had in a long time if not ever . Great service as well .<->1
Love the beef fajitas ! Great service and great ambience . This is a wonderful place to bring the family too and it 's priced perfectly !<->1
3rd time here , favorite sandwich place in the land of V , large pastrami with cheese , among the top 10 places to eat in Las Vegas , i think .<->1
The very wet turkey I had went well with the unpleasant caramelized onions and soggy peppers .<->0
The bartenders were friendly and attentive . I enjoy a good dive bar and this definitely fits .<->1
Excellent if you like spicy ! The inside of the place is amazing , food is great for the price and the staff super friendly . Def worth the lineup<->1
Best pizza hands down ! Wish Las Vegas had more locations . The King Arthur supreme pizza and the vegetarian pizza are my two favorites .<->1
It was exceptional ! ! ! They have a wide variety of sushi dishes . Order the surf clams ! ! !<->1
Bland crust . Bland cheese . Bland thin watery sauce . Even the sausage topping was meh . Do not recommend . How so many yelpers can give such glowing reviews ... there are much better options .<->2
I went here with my friends on Christmas eve . I ordered their tasting menu which is a five course menu ... Every single course was divine and very filling ! ! ! Definitely will be back here<->1
The pizza is good here . Although there was a funny smell to it . They have great prices and they actually sell SLICES ! Not common in vegas . I plan on eating here again with hopes of no funny smell to the pizza<->2
Authentic Thai food is hard to come by . This place is definitely authentic ! Food is amazing . Everything on the menu is delish !<->1
Bought Some Ribeye Steaks . Oh Shit was this the Bomb ! ! ! Perfect . I wished All of us could experience Quality . Yes I 'm talking about flavor and tenderness . Totally Surprised .<->1
Wow . Sooooo yummy Pho , Shrimp with Pork , Thai Tea , Edamame and Orange Chicken . No complaints at all and really enjoyed it . We will be back .<->1
Absolute favorite restaurant ! Everything on the menu is amazing & the service OMG ! Highly recommend to anyone !<->1
One of the worst dinners for the price Roberto 's food is better I would not recommend this is not worth the price ..<->0
Perhaps the best meal I 've had in Toronto , ever . Our server , Joel , understands the science of flavours and gave us exceptional recommendations .<->1
Great place to eat and have a drink . Large menu with different food selections . I enjoyed they have a dinning room separated from the bar area .<->1
Ca n't go wrong with this place . Been coming here a long time . Solid sushi . Not a bad price at all ! Good atmosphere , and open till 4 am now<->1
I do n't know why everyone are so crazy about this place , I honestly do n't like that fat stincky broath blah<->0
Very good , Lunch special 7 Days a week . Decent amount of food for decent price .<->1
i order delivery food was so delicious jerk chicken with rice & peas and vegetables definitely worth it will be ordering again ! ! !<->1
Amazing hot dogs ! Authentic and delicious food made me feel like I was back home in Colombia . Ca n't wait to go back !<->1
Yum ! My favorite of any dept store restaurnt I have been too . Get a seat on he window and you can look out onto the strip / Wynn / Ti / Venetian . The white truffle mac and cheese is superb .<->1
Dim Sum was great on par with Golden Door and better than Ambassador . Same people running Grand Yatt - not loving the decor too noisy .<->1
BEST BUFFALO WILD WINGS EVER . Super nice bathrooms too , they are located under the Coors Light sign by the front entrance :)<->1
If you like Thai food , you like this place . The decor is kind of authentic , the food is excellent . I had the green curry and all the veggis in there were super fresh . Very pleasant service .<->1
Best pizza in Chicago ! ! We devoured our sausage and pepperoni pizza tonight . Yum ! Wish we had these in LA !<->1
Love coming here . The gelato and coffee remind me of being in Europe . Lovely family runs this perfect cafe . Sandwiches are absolutely delicious !<->1
They ca n't follow simple directions . I asked for a burger with bacon cheese and mayo . They forgot the cheese , there was one drop of mayo & the bacon was overcooked .<->0
On a visit to Montreal , my wife and I had an amazing time here . The food was sublime , and the presentation was artful and playful . The service was fantastic as well . This is a great place for a celebration .<->1
The atmosphere here is absolutely stellar . And the food is equally awe - inspiring . Whenever I 'm in the area , I always make it a point to stop by . It 's one of those wonderful little hidden gems that you never grow tired of .<->1
Delicious sushi . Tried the spiderman roll and tango roll . Do n't get the veggie tempura .<->1
Pretty cramped quarters and not " cozy " cramped . And good luck with your take - out order : you 'll probably come home to find they completely messed things up .<->0
The best maple bacon donut anyone in the world could ask for . Even when they 're out sometimes he 'll go make you one . It is so good ! People are always super nice and everything is fresh<->1
One of my favorite lunch spots near my office . The food is always fresh and delicious . I love the chicken and ground beef kabobs !<->1
Went here with a groupon . Food was great , service was friendly , clean upstairs washroom , very relaxed eating atmosphere .<->1
The local Vegetarian restaurant in 17th ave . Went them for brunch and was quite pleased with everything . good service , great food , and brightly lit and welcoming ambience .<->1
Simply awesome . Exceptional service as they were so friendly and helpful . 3 flavours of cheesecake : original , chocolate , and coffee . Definitely worth a try if you like uncle tetsu ( gf said this was better ) .<->1
Got " The Bobbie " to see what all the hype was about . It honestly was n't the greatest sandwich I 've ever tasted referring to the sandwiches back in San Francisco , but it was pretty good . Better than Subway for sure !<->2
Just SO good . I get the fried chicken in bao buns . It 's just SO good , the fresh veg makes it . A must try if you have not been here before .<->1
Had this terrific drink and we had a strawberry smoothie . We tried this new place and were n't sure about someplace new . Everything was really tasty here . We still like our regular place better but it was good !<->1
it gets the job done . fast . kind of pricy for what you get . but its open late and that s all that s all that matters sometimes . better the gus 's<->2
An impulse stop for Thai food netted a great dining experience . Very friendly staff , quick service , and tasty food . We will return here .<->1
Staff was amazing , friendly , informative , attentive . Great happy hour deals and food was awesome too ! I will definitely be back !<->1
great place , good beer xyingu , good service , mango sorbet omg now all I need is a coupon<->1
I 've been there for dinner . It 's excellent ! The real French food . Great atmosphere , a bit noisy though . The place is small and I recommend making a reservation ahead . Great spot .<->1
Great place to go and have a beer , good food and overall a great time . We are there almost on a biweekly status and they never let us down .<->1
authentic , tasty Mexican food with great service . local family restaurant with amazing food and very reasonable prices . do n't miss the chance to eat here .<->1
... Great orange juice ! great buffle but if you 're going at their busy time , be prepared to wait in queue .<->1
As good as it gets ! Daniel was awesome ! Totally accomadating , made me a special dish of cooked veggies , tomato sauce and mozzarella cheese . Delish ! Cool place<->1
Very good coffee shop for those interested in well made espresso drinks and pour over coffee . Ambiance is clean and great for some reading or study work . Not good for the Starbucks milk shake crowd ... thank goodness .<->1
Yes ! Yes ! Yes ! This coffee was probably the best I have ever had , anywhere . I will be returning frequently . The staff is helpful and friendly and the location and hours are perfect .<->1
Delicious food and welcoming staff . The meat tastes excellent and melts in your mouth . The portions are very generous too .<->1
Competent Italian food in downtown Madison . Had the mozzarella di buffalo salad and penne puttanesca along with a glass of Chianti . Quite good and reasonable prices .<->2
Not sure how the food is yet because it 's been 45min since we ordered . The service here is SLOW ! Maybe it 's an off night ? First time here & not the best first impression :/<->0
Great donuts , tried cream filled , chocolate with chocolate cream and plain glazed , one is a meal for me .<->1
So good but pricey ! They charge extra for everything ... where elsewhere it 's included . Ca n't complain too much though .. it was hands down the best poke bowl I have ever had !<->1
Worst Circle K store ever .. charging more then what 's listed on shelf .. dirty .. nothing but a very scummy place<->0
Great sandwiches . It ' s cheap and really good . If you lost a lot of money gambling , or just do n't have much to spend , eat here instead of eating fast food .<->1
Nothing special , I got the Rudy Special you 're typical steakumm steak sandwich , the quality left a lot to be desired . It was a decent size for the price .<->2
Got delivery and it took about 40 minutes to get to me but it was well worth the wait ! My calzone was amazing ! Definitely will be ordering here again ! :)<->1
Nick gave us great service , very knowledgeable and friendly . The soufflé wa fabulous . The lamb burger and Andre 's burger were so , so good . Happy hour has a great menu and wine list . Overall a wonderful find for us ! !<->1
They do a pretty good job washing cars here . It 's just expensive compared to other places .<->1
Although they are still working to get everything up and running , this amazing little restaurant is a wonderful place to go eat , or to get dinner and take out ! Absolutely delicious , and Betty , one of the owners , is a delight !<->1
Great place for a group of people to hang out . Lots of things to do there to keep you entertained . Food is good too !<->1
This place was awesome will for sure come back the next time we are in town . Had the sea bass and it was so yummy along with the Brussels sprouts .<->1
Worst Indian food ever ! ! ! Worst Customer service ever ! ! ! VERY VERY unsanitary . One of the servers sneezed Infront of me in the lobby and did not even go to wash his hands .<->0
This place is not good at all . The food is expensive and does not stand up to the standards set by the price ; food was just bland like taco bell ... do not go here<->0
My favorite place . You just ca n't go wrong . Neighborhood locals and the owners seem to know everyone . Every pizza is delicious and the nightly specials are so different and creative .<->1
Great place for lunch . 2 Shwarmas for $ 8.25 . Staff always accommodate when I ask for extra time on the grill .<->1
We enjoyed the food immensely and drink prices are very reasonable . Pleasant atmosphere and good service.uh<->1
I loved the food , service , and the overall environment . Must try the kung pao it 's to die for ! Will definitely come back !<->1
Oyster bar ! ! ! $ 18 / doz . And they have Don Buri ! ! ! Yum . Beer is around $ 5 . Entrees start at $ 17 . Cozy up to the bar , and watch your oysters shucked ! ! !<->1
Love Yard House ! This location is busy , but the wait time is not too bad . The food is always good , the drinks are great , and the wait staff is always kind . Highly recommend visiting this location .<->1
Rebecca and Karol where excellent in introducing us to the experience ! Fun , messy , and exciting ! Great sauces !<->1
The pizza is great . The delivery guy is really nice . I like thin crust pizza , so I wish it could be a little bit more thinner . Other than that , everything is perfect<->1
Awesome pesto pizza ! Fresh brewed iced tea .. very quick service . Dreya is very efficient and friendly . Great old style pizza place . Classy<->1
Good food for a good price , we had shrimps , fried rice , pan fried noodle , fried fish , soup . The waiter named Minh was very friendly and helpful . If you ask him what he recommends , he will give you a good advice .<->1
Very good Sushi excellent happy hour prices our new close by sushi restaurant . The sushi rolls are large try the Rainbow roll the California rolls are good too .<->1
The Pizza reminded me of Back home NY . Female cook hooked it up and made my pizza well done just like i asked . Ill deff be coming back for more .<->1
I had a pretty great Reuben here the other day . I had n't been in a while , but I feel my criticism of the slow service / high prices remains a problem . But the Reuben was really good , so there is that .<->2
Amazing staff who take the time to walk you through any and all questions you may have . Love the samples they offer as well . Great selection of drinks , bitters , gifts .<->1
I had the Greek omelet with added chicken . It was good but average . I would recommend this place or come back again for a quick bite<->2
Cool location and vibe . Food was pretty good . Two drinks that I ordered were bad . Weird mixture for a plain marguerita and a red sangria . Quick service . Would like to return to try a few other things here .<->2
This Denny 's is located downtown , has a bar , and it is beautiful ! It 's modern with a hint of whimsy . Though the food is what you 'd expect from any other Denny 's , the atmosphere is not ! Check it out !<->1
Great lunch spot ! Pizza and panini 's are amazing ! Definitely would come here again . They have a fast service casual side and a nicer side to eat . They also have a cute front patio . This is authentic Italian eating .<->1
Terrible . Nuff said . Horrible service , horrible food . Shocking because The Cheesecake Factory is one of my favorite go to spots . Never again in NC ! Happy to be back in Phoenix .<->0
A shout out to this wonderful baker for making cupcakes for our fifth grade promotional ceremony at Estes Mcdoniel . If you have n't tried this place not only are all the sweats delicious the atmosphere is gorgeous !<->1
Really like this place ... the staff is great . Cozy atmosphere . The food is delicious ! ! ! A side from the juicy sliders the veggie bowl is on point .<->1
This place is awesome ! Everything from service to food . Best mediteranian food spot in town ! SERIOUSLY ! GIVE IT A GO<->1
My first farmers market visit in Charlotte . Really good selection of goods . Everyone was quite friendly .<->1
Food is pretty average ! Yet you can have the first date with the women you love with all your heart here ! So , we will be coming back !<->0
Fabulous ! Margaritas are addicting , and the guacamole recipes make it difficult to pick a favorite . We went on Sunday afternoon and sat right at the bar . The bartender is awesome , and we will definitely return soon !<->1
Clean facility , very friendly staff . Will come here again , one of the cleanest QT 's I 've seen ! ! !<->1
Great service and good food . We had a burger , fries and wings . Sean minor was yum . The beer selection however was lacking .<->1
Not worth the hype . Their ramen is average . Truffle flavour made it interesting and unique , but the pork was dry and not flavorful . Definitely not worth the long lineup . There are alot more ramen places around that are better .<->2
Best fish and chips in Toronto . They 've got the tar tar sauce packets which is a huge bonus for me cause I always prefer them over the homemade kind , and not so many places use them .<->1
What a joke not even close to Vienna style Chicago sorry but your flavors not there . Born raised Chicagoan<->0
Wonderful staff and lots of fun games . They just increased some of the games to 2 tokens , but still a great deal .<->1
Nice oyster bar selection . Service is friendly and pleasant atmosphere . Location is great with the vip theatre close by . Lobster nachos is a must try !<->2
Good food ! I love the bottles of salsa they give when you sit down , and sitting outside on a nice day is great .<->2
Great place love it ! go you wo n't be disappointed Marina Degrandis was so pleasant and professional town square is easy to get to LOVE IT THE BEST I WILL BE BACK THANK YOU MARINA YOU ARE THE BEST .<->1
Long lines long wait this AM . Barista ca n't keep up with volume . Bad day in the coffee world . Going on 20 minutes to wait<->0
Extremely yummy food and very friendly service ! ! Definitely one of the best thai places in TO !<->1
Wonderful place ! Food was incredible , really fresh ! Owner was there to greet and introduce himself . Really personable . I would recommend this to everyone !<->1
Like this place , the staff is nice ... it 's a good place to chill but of course there are still room for improvement .<->1
Great atmosphere . Great food . Great service . A great place to grab a bite not far fromAirport .<->1
Its good food , the potatoes or their type of coating on them is n't to my liking but it 's not bad food either<->2
Ordered a chopped chicken salad and the chicken cheese steak combo . Maddelynn was very nice . Food was very very good . Fries were great . Very reasonably priced .<->1
I do recommend this place . The food was really good and the staff was friendly . I would go again . I like the atmosphere and it was clean . I had the enchilada plate and a taco . We left full and satisfied .<->1
This place is amazing , great food , great drinks and atmosphere . The bar staff could not have treated us better . The ranch dressing is absolutely to die for . Please someone send me the recipe ..<->1
This place is the best ! They serve some of the best coffee I 've ever had in NC and I always love their pastry offerings . Quick service and nice people , you really ca n't beat it .<->1
Wow in a sea of chains and mediocre ethnic places in AZ this is a refreshing change . Authentic and tasty - highly recommended !<->1
It 's just Burger King and getting service slightly different manner . Nothing super special about this except you watch them build your burger and there is beer if you want to buy ... that 's it ! nothing out of this world ...<->0
Omg the best Vietnamese sandwich sub in town . So fresh lots of meat not cheap with veggies over the top . The girl Who took my order was super cute and sweet too . I 'm coming back tomorrow<->1
Seems to be just average place now . For example , they used have pretty good fries but now seem like cheap WalMart fries . May not be going back .<->0
Everything was really delicious ! Parking was a nightmare , but that 's typical for Charlotte and Midwood . I 'd definitely go back !<->1
I have been coming here for years . This is the best Thai food I 've has in Charlotte . The staff is friendly and it is always clean .<->1
Chenjeh and Joojeh were so tasty . The ambient is attractive , decorated with classic drawings and décor . People were friendly and charming .<->1
I ve been here a couple times and the food is always fresh and super tasty . If you enjoy eastern European cuisine this is the place to go for some good old home cookin food<->1
Updating because I 've already been here four times within the past two weeks and the cashier had recognized me . Still stand by my critique that the extra spicy beef patty could be spicier . Still gon na go back though .<->1
Sometimes I just really want tea . Especially in Vegas ! My friend recommended this spot to try and it was great ! I had their TARO MILK TEA , with light sugar . I 'll be a return customer next time I 'm in town . ENJOY !<->2
Do n't have anything to add that other reviewers have n't said , but terrible customer service and incorrect deliveries and charges .<->0
This is my first time in this place and OMGoodness the food was fabulous ! Won Ton Soup , chicken noodles with broccoli , stir fry chicken veggies were all so good . A definitely thumbs up place .<->1
The Falls ' hidden gem - - kooky decor , decadent food at a reasonable price . No reason why you should n't be eating here .<->1
Great place to people watch . And the bloody marys are good too . Had breakfast here , so I wo n't comment on the cuisine other than to say they have a good breakfast .<->1
Never had a bad meal . Also they have a great and curtious staff , and really cute waitreses . i highly recommend trying the stuffed hot peppers .<->1
Love the orange chicken . Interior and staff need an update .<->1
Best donuts in town ! It 's a sketchy location but worth the drive . I never buy donuts anywhere else . The service is always friendly . The place is always spotless . Excellent !<->1
The drinks are always on point . I try a different flavor each time and it never disapoints . The boba is always nice and soft . If they ask me for a great boba spot , i always recommend this one .<->1
A shadow of its former self . Pork bone soup was disappointing . You can tell because there are few Koreans eating here now .<->0
The food was delicious , but it was a lot of food , be careful haha you better get the combo . The service is fast and the people nice .<->1
If you like burgers and you have n't been here . I suggest you hurry your ass up . Directly influenced by IN N OUT in California . It has its own spin on it and the high priestess rivals the bigmac<->1
Always good food and great salads .. Just feel refreshed and healthy after eating here . You have to love the Chicken Chop Salad<->1
Best gryo spot in peoria hands down . Not much needed to say but make your way to 73rd n bell and enjoy<->1
Fantastic sushi , the rolls were terrific and the service was excellent . We were down from Alaska for vacation and are very picky when it comes to seafood . That said I would recommend this place to anyone<->1
Not up to par at all . Too much rice in the maki rolls . Hot entrees were mediocre . Service was fast and friendly . Fish was fresh . But many better choices nearby .<->0
Great Happy Hour ! Ca n't wait to try the lamb . Also a real treat to see Micheal working ! ! !<->1
Great handmade ice cream and awesome service . Convenient location at Providence and New Town .<->1
This was our first time at La Bocca and we really enjoyed it . Had the bruschetta , pasta and pizza . All were very good and unique in their own way . Will be back . Great service .<->1
Great island food ! I really enjoyed eating there . The service is great , the portions are definitely island style , and the food tastes yummy . If you 're craving island food , check this place out . It 's awesome .<->1
HUGE portions , street style food . I wish it was a little more seasoned . my wet burrito was a little bland .. maybe this is was a one time mishap ... definitely would love to come by and try a few other items .<->2
Still got it after all these years ( we first tried it about 10 years ago when it was in a different location ) . I like the intense dark hot chocolate .<->1
Went there for dinner , which is good , but pretty overpriced . The appetizers were delicious - had the king crab and tuna tartar . The cod and walu for dinner were pretty good too , but not as good as the appetizers .<->2
Came here last night , the service was not the best . In my opinion it is very expensive . You 're better off going and getting a steak for a better price .<->2
Best Pho in the City ! Amazing portion sizes , great simple foods and very very cheap . What more can I say ?<->1
Great subs , been around forever , love it ! Thank You<->1
Saw this place on groupon and decided to give it a try . Glad I did , I ordered a bacon , egg , and cheese bagel that tasted great . I 'll definitely be back to try out their lunch menu .<->1
The food was really good i had fries and wings and fries were soo warm and wings were fried but not too much oil .<->1
Surprisingly delicious sushi , however their decor is lacking . The place looked a little sketchy to say the least , but the friendly staff made up for that ! We tried the jalepeno bombs , vegas roll , and the volcano roll .. All very tastey .<->1
The restaurant is beautiful . We were seated outside and were able to enjoy the weather and also had a nice view of the the strip . Food was great , as well as the service .<->1
Good , fresh sushi at a reasonable price . Only 4 stars due to the limited wine list .<->1
REAL COFFEE ... excellent espresso and americano ... not a push button operation like the big chains ... a true coffee shop<->1
Everything was awesome today ! Waitress was super fast got our order in and our food was delicious today , will definitely be back ! ! !<->1
Great pizza , fun environment . if you 're searching for good eats in downtown Vegas , you 've found the spot !<->1
Food was great however within 5 seconds of paying asked to switch to grass fed beef . They would not do it . Sadly the place is great just wish they would honor a health conscience consumer .<->0
My favorite wings in the world . I 've been eating them for over 10 years now . The bartenders are great too<->1
Food was great ... it 's like eating at mom 's house . Started out a little rocky ... but in the end we enjoyed everything !<->1
Nice room . Patio is in the shade most of the afternoon . Service is excellent . A bit pricey though . Pork belly is not as good as advertised . But the calamari and quesadilla during HH are very good .<->1
The food is fresh and wholesome . Red pepper gouda soup is excellent !<->1
Stopped in the bar for a drink with friends . Pretty quiet on a Friday night . Service was good . I had a off menu chocolate martini .<->1
Not only was the food excellent , the atmosphere was great ! The service was amazing ! ! I could n't of asked for a better place to take to take an out of state guest for a great meal and casual entertainment !<->1
Fantastic customer service . Grilled cheese , animal style and well done fries . This place speaks for itself ... yum !<->1
Highly recommended . The Nabeyaki Udon was absolutely delicious ! Udon is freshly made to order . I ca n't rave enough on the flavors of the broth . Full of flavor that 's delightfully satisfying and tasty to the palate .<->1
I just wish there were more locations in the valley . This one is always packed ! They are the coolest people and have some really good coffee , but the wait is a huge turn off .<->1
One of the best macaroons I 've ever had . I 'm from Toronto and I love butter avenue . And these are just as great . Some flavours are actually better as well . Their salted caramels are my favourite .<->1
The subs were amazing , price a bit high but worth it . I 'd go back .<->1
I love this place . Ca n't get over the Mac N Cheese they have . They literally have any Mac N cheese combo you could think of . Just had the mexi - mac . F * # K ! ! ! Also , the boneless barbosa wings , my lord ! ! !<->1
Service was crazy bad . They ca n't handle it when it 's busy but I 'm sure it 's fine when there are n't too many people to overwhelm their short staff .<->0
It 's a Cogo / Citgo combo . Always busy , but a quick busy . Product selection is the norm for a convenience store .<->2
The food here is delish ! Especially love the hot n sour soup and the sweet n sour fish . Literally a hole in the wall and would not have gone if it was nt for yelp . Coming back for sure :)<->1
First time eating here . Pizza was very good . Staff were very friendly and helpful . My wife 's ? pizza was to spicy for and and they replace it without any issues . We will be back for sure .<->1
Freaking love this place is where I get all my nutrition stuff the staff here is great and know what there doing been coming here for the past 3 years<->1
Great German fare at reasonable prices ! Wonderful ambiance and a great outdoor area , even in cooler weather .<->1
The antipasto salad was delicious and the cheesy bread with the marina dipping sauce was a nice addition which more than filled me .<->1
Charged 11 $ / oz for a liqueur that is 6 $ / oz at other restaurants ... Good food rude waiter too much for the liquor and a physical threat from the waiter ... Hmmmm<->0
great staff , very nice and helpful . gluten free and organic masa available<->1

Really great eggs ! Such variety . Muffins galore . Tabatha excellent server ! Great Vegas trip experience . Come here for good breakfast and unlimited coffee refills ! Bandido muy delicioso . Would eat again after long drive to Nevada !<->1
The gelato was not good . It melted so fast and the gelato definitely did not taste gourmet as the other places I have had gelato . Tasted like melted ice cream .<->0
Food was good - ok . I had the lunch special - almond chicken . They give you a good amount of food for the price . I would eat here again if in the Chinese Cultural Center - but would not make a special trip .<->2
Always hit this place when visiting from San Diego . Always enjoy the Salted Pork , Bitter Melon with Shrimp , Roasted Chicken , Pork Lo Mein , Walnut Shrimp and Orange Chicken ! ! ! Perfect place for kids ... lots of noise !<->1
Excellent sushi selection and good service ! All - you - can eat price is reasonable . They bring out your order immediately ! They are constantly making their rounds to see if you need to order some more or if you need refills to your drinks !<->1
awesome place always . sometime you have to dig around to find undamaged fruit . but for the price its worth it<->1
Pretty good sushi for the price , I love that you can order online and then pick it up at the restaurant . The price is really fair and the sushi and rolls are really big . I 've ordered twice from here already .<->1
This location has the world famous chocolate fountain . Dark , milk , and white chocolate flows from top to bottom . 2 tons in all . The gelato and crepes were amazing .<->1
Yum ! ! We love this place ! ! The calamari is nothing short of amazing ! The service was also fantastic ! Great date night place !<->1
There sandwiches are always delicious the staff is super friendly and delivery is fast thank you for such excellent food and service<->1
We have zabas once a week from this location staff is always friendly food is always good sometimes the lines do n't move as quickly as you think they will but over all they are good to go .<->1
Had outstanding Serbian food while I was in Chicago for work . This is the first place that has come close to that experience I have found in my travels . I will definitely come here anytime I am in Phoenix<->1
Placed a delivery order , over 1.5 hours later was told they never received the order . Shame .<->0
I think I appreciate this place more after just having a terrible meal at the burger bar . The lamb burger is amazing ! The decor is fun and the prices are super affordable for Vegas !<->1
Cheap and acceptable food . Good for breakfast and very good service . Highly recommended .<->1
The food here is amazing . The staff is super friendly . The restaurant is also very clean ! I would recommend coming here when in the downtown Phoenix area !<->1

Best Mexican in Vegas ! Killer fajitas , and amazing service ! ! ! Love this place ! !<->1
This place is crazy . The waiter started to fight a customer and chase him down the street screaming that the cops were coming . Honestly so embracing . But other than that Adrianna was a great server lol !<->0
Delish and price spot on ! Service was good . It was an off time after 2 pm . Want to visit again soon .<->1
Very good coffee and very nice place to sit to visit or work . Good sitting areas and plenty of plug ins . Friendly staff and clean bathrooms . I am planning to return .<->1

Cute , modern , pastel love - fest looking place . I requested a sample of the Carrot Cake , which was promptly handed over : white gelato , white spoon ... and a black , curly hair . Truly , a Kodak moment .<->0
Gianni 's alongside Florios are the standout Italian style restaurants in Scarborough . The location is great , the layout is great and the food is great . Always give this place 5 out of 5 every visit I make .<->1
This Second Cup is on the Third floor of the Eaton Centre near the walkway to the Bay . Staff is always attentive and courteous . Coffee is always fresh and the milk bar is well stocked .<->1
Huge delicious subs . Anthony is awesome so friendly will definitely continue going back ! !<->1
The salmon was burned and the rice was gross . They only had three choices for steaks . The service was VERY slow .<->0

Meet fresh cold signature is so heavenly ! I am now addicted to this place . Highly recommended to people who are searching for good shaved ice and grass jelly !<->1
The chicken was overcooked and dry . The waffles were nothing special . Sorry , I do n't get all the hype about this place . Not impressed at all . No Jalapenos to go with fried chicken . I will not return . Service was good .<->0
Customer service was great and the staff was very friendly ! Had the chicken caeser wrap ! Food was delicious and the drinks were tasty . Would definitely recommend to friends as a healthy alternative for lunch !<->1
We received top notch service from Amanda . They cater to my wife 's severe food allergies with out any hassle . Food always tastes great and is always hot . You do n't always find service like this in a chain restaurant ...<->1

The Best indian buffet in las vegas .. highly recommended for indian food lovers .. the deserts are simply awesome and the tandoori chicken ..<->1
Great wood fired pizza ! A little tight inside but worth the wait ! Amazing place with friendly staff and reasonable prices !<->1
I 've been to this location four times in two months and they always are out of doughnuts unless you order original . I think I may be done buying doughnuts here .<->0
More like a takeout place , no service , table sticky , the space is a little bit dark . Definitely had better pho before . Price ok but not cheap . Wo n't go again<->0
Bon déjeuner à prix abordable . Par contre les plats pourraient plus chaud et le service est moyen .<->2
Best cappuccino I 've had in south Charlotte . They also make a great Caffe Viennese , which I 've found is hard to come by !<->1
The Gyro meat is incredible ! I have been here multiple times just because of the gyro meat . i highly recommend this establishment<->1
Sooooo good . Went here because the line at Carolina 's was too long . Glad it worked out that way because I found out that Taqueria Los Angeles is better than Carolina 's .<->1
Sad to see this place close . We have n't been since they moved out of Green Valley Ranch . There food was really good and we always had a blast when we were there .<->1
Bambi best bartender ever . Food and drinks were great , thanks for the attention to detail . Definitely recommend this place<->1

Food and ambiance is great . Ask for Jacob , he is the best ! Service is always improving . Get the pork and shrimp tacos !<->1
Why they need to take down the to Arby 's listings on East Tropicana and South Maryland Parkway they are both closed down<->0
Not quite my taste for Texas Brisket considering I 'm fromTexas . But great Memphis pulled pork . Sauce is bomb diggity no doubt . Love the location too in green Valley . Definitely a nice spot to get your fat on . Awesome place .<->1
Food is average for this type place . Bar service leaves you waiting , and they come off like they are doing you a favor by serving you , also way overpriced compared to similar spots in the area !<->0
Had a very nice bacon cheese burger and fries with my wife . Fast service and clean establishment .<->1
Awful . All apps are deep fried and just terrible ... 3 cars in the parking lot should have told us it was bad news . Terrible .<->0

The tapas are amazing , as are the pasta dishes . Have n't tried the pizza yet , but it looks great ! Great atmosphere , friendly and knowledgeable staff , jazz on Friday nights , who could ask for more ? ? ? New favorite place to go !<->1
Their food is pretty good . They are like a slightly better quality Quaker Steak . The only real complaint I can think of is that they always seem to be super busy .<->2
Fast delivery and good food ! ! ! I ordered lunch at work today and the guy showed up within 30 minutes ! ! Dishes were still hot and yummy ! The chow mein was<->1
Great food , great staff , great location and great prices ! ! This family - owned business is well - run . Everyone feels like home ! !<->1
LOVE the matzo ball soup and brisket sliders ! The bakery is extensive .<->1
The best restaurant in Boulder City for a quick meal and friendly service . Best French frys in town .<->1
Do not get seafood soup unless you like chewing squid , pongant fish and a sever that does n't explain that the wood chip in the soup is not to be eaten ..<->0
Went here for dinner . Not tht much of a selection . Prize was not bad . FYI , drink is not included .<->0
Ordered from Mamma 's pizza late night when staying downtown . The delivery was quick and the pizza was really good - your typical mamma 's pizza quality with thin new york style pizza . I think mamma 's uses some real good quality ingredients<->2
Great atmosphere go here with the girls . Staff was amazing . Food has been great everytime . Had the chicken marsala was great !<->1
Great food and good scenery . Friendly staff and a nice downtown spot to eat and enjoy yourself at .<->1
Way .. overpriced . Good coffee and the food was pretty good as well . But it did take a long time to come out . There 's not many places to sit either .<->2
Your food will be made wrong every . Single . Time . You 're better off going to smash burger across the street .<->0
Really good pizza ! My boyfriend and I devoured The New Yorker . The decor is kind of bizarre but it 's clean and I like the casino that it 's located in . I would definitely return .<->1
Amazing food , exquisite presentation . Menu changes often , with an emphasis on the freshest ingredients . The staff really knows the menu and is very helpful with helping the diner choose or even customize an order .<->1
Yummy tacos at a reasonable price . The fish tacos were a bit bland for my liking , but the chicken was great .<->1
Great crust on the pizza " pie . " Nice patio , excellent salads , good food , clean restaurant ... I have come her for years and it is better than ever . Great atmosphere .<->1
Huge portions . Great prices . Service was excellent . Amanda was an excellent server . Would recommend .<->1
If Burger King served it 's breakfast as a sit - down establishment , it would be 100 times better . Enough said .<->0
Burrito Boyz is so freaking delicious . Go and you shall not be disappointed . Gets 6 stars when you are drunk or high . :D<->1
Great atmosphere , service and menu . Fish and chips were so tasty ! There always seems to be a wait , understandably so , because it 's worth it .<->1
my boyfriends favorite restaurant in vegas . we go here for birthdays a lot . i love this place too - and that s from someone who has always hated teppanyaki restaurants . its awesome<->1
Fantastic authentic food . The beef and green chili tacos are wonderful . Good salsa bar<->1
Très bon petit pub de quartier , large choix de bières ( do nt une bière à la mangue ! ! ) et prix très correctsIl y a aussi de la bouffe ms je n'ai pas testéService excellent ! A essayer !<->1
Amazing coffee with a cool decor this is one of our favorite places for a great cup of Joe !<->1
This sour cream onion dip is " the Shit ! " The store where I usually shop sold out of it , and I bought another brand - YUCK ! - not even close ! Nothing else will do for chips and dip .<->1
Servers were nice , food was mediocre and flavorless . You pay for atmosphere , not the food .<->0
Absolutely amazing food service ! ! ! Everything was delicious ! ! ! We 'll for sure come again when we come to Vegas !<->1
Over - priced , medicore , pre - prepared food . Inattentive , disorganized staff . Lame .<->0
Pizza and wings were both great ! The owner was friendly . I will make this a regular stop . Prices were very reasonable .<->1
This was one of the most unique dining experiences I have ever had ! It is a bit pricey but the ambiance and the presentation makes it worth it !<->1
The food was okay , nothing special . But the older guy at the counter needs to chill , you wo n't get customers back with an attitude .<->0
Amazing roasted beet salad marinated with vinagrette and mixed with mandarin oranges and red cabbage . Worth a visit .<->1
The worst ! The workers are uneducated and have no customer service skills or knowledge ! The food is terrible and not to mention expensive . Do n't waste your money . If you 're looking for real Mexican food / snacks Go to Carreta De Lily instead ! !<->0
FAVORITE PLACE TO EAT IN ARIZONA . Usually only a wait on friday nights but it 's worth the wait . Super cheap ! Love it !<->1
I come here often for lunch . Food is always fresh and yummy ! ! Staff are really patient and friendly . The place is always clean . 5/5<->1
The ambiance , service and food were excellent . The sausage pizza is the best I 've ever had . Banana trifle dessert was also spectacular .<->1
Stopped in again for our usual pancake fix , and this time , we also shared a Denver omelet , toast with fresh peach and strawberry preserves and fresh squezzed valencia OJ ... happy campers as always ... ALOHA ! ! !<->1
Such a great community , driven coffee shop . Excellent coffee and even better service ( if that 's even possible ! ! ! )<->1
Really good food although portions are n't very big . Kind of a swanky but welcoming feel . Highly recommend for a laid back but quality date night .<->1
This was really gross . Three of us went and we 're all feeling sick . The smells , the sights , the tastes , everything was rough . Except the jello . That was ok .<->0
Loved the salad bar and soup . Drinks were great . I got the beer battered cod . I would go back but get a different kind of fish because it was pretty salty .<->2
Waited 1 hour for seating . Hostess kept calling wrong number . Not worth the wait for regular bar food . Not the best bar selection .<->0
Services was amazing ! View fantastic . Good delicious . Manager was actively moving and checking on customers .<->1
The absolute worst dining experience I 've ever had . Well over an hour for our food and then it was wrong . Horrible customer service . I would n't tell my worst enemy to go there .<->0
I just tried this place out for resturant week . It was wonderful . I highly recommend trying it . They have a very unique and delicious selection .<->1
Best oatmeal in town . You have to try everything on the menus ... Everything is so good , all home made quality food .<->1
wow , i just tried the mocha cappuccino blended boba . one of the best flavors ever ! you can definitely taste the mocha chocolate !<->1
Cute little hidden gem ! They serve the most amazing smoothies with whipped cream , cookies or donuts . We tried the brownie and it was fantastic ! The owner is also friendly and does all the goodies .<->1
Overall great experience . One of the best restaurants in Durham .<->1
Chicken jambalaya , omg it 's so good here ! It 's made it on my must haves when I visit . The flavours just melt so well together and the rice is soooo soft and fluffy ... the perfect combo . Highly recommended .<->1
Great salad bar . I was disappointed that they do n't have the chicken and salmon additions to the salad any more . The soups were good and so was the bread . The pasta selection was very bland and unappetizing .<->2
Wontons , fabulous ! Beet salad with vegan cheese , flavorful ! Steak & Potatoes looks like REAL steak ! Customer service needs a little attention . Only issue with food - it was a little too salty for me . Will be back ! Amazing selection of food !<->1
Totally charming . Great service -- spectacular actually . The classic tartiflette was delicious . Randomly found it off a side street . I will intentionally return my next trip .<->1
Classy Ethiopian restaurant . We came from San jose and loved this place and the service .<->1
This place had really great service and ambiance but the food was alright ... I prefer Gordon Ramsey around the corner<->1
Had there 1/2 pound hamburger with mushrooms ... it was really good .. people are very nice there all the time .. I also get garlic pizza for my son with there special and he just loves it ... quick and ez ...<->1
All you can eat sushi ! Great for sushi lovers who live in the area . They forgot to bring some things we ordered and the service was a bit slow , but food tasted great .<->2
Great Prime Rib Dinner for the price<->1
Brunch is busy but does n't mean good ... very much buffet style flavors which means not that great .. it just did n't hit the spot for a simple fast breakfast .<->2
Best imported food store around ! They have the absolute best spanakopita it is worth the hour drive for me to stock up on it .<->1
best dang wings ever . best bartender , best cook , best place . Did I mention the food ? ? ? BEST EVER ! ! !<->1
We went to this place on Sunday afternoon and it was quite . This was the very first experience . Everything is just delightful . Freshly made sangria and apprised and hot sauce , as well as main course . Authentic and delicious .<->1
Overpriced and mediocre . It cost $ 15 just for the twaco . The chicken was dry , thin , not crunchy . The waffle was n't crunchy either . Also located in a sketchy area<->0
First time here . Came on a Sunday night & it was quiet & enjoyable . Our rolls started coming out right away & the poki was really good ! Definitely will be back again !<->1
Went there for an early dinner today and the good and the service was excellent . Very clean and sparkling . Will definitely be back soon<->1
Food was ok . Service was horrible . People working there were friendly but that is no excuse for horrid service . Even the bill took over 20 minutes . Just could n't wait to get out of there and even that took long .<->0
They play awful music 90 % of the time but serve food until 11 pm and it really is great food :) ... Just fix the horrible music ! ! Way too loud and usually crappy top 40 or cheesy dj 's ... sigh !<->1
Good price for a burger ! Poutines were a good big portion as well . I would recommend to my friends .<->1
Everything was sooo delcious . Our waitor was super nicer too ! !<->1
Thanks Bri for an amazing lunch . Great service and a better personality . My burger was perfect and I really enjoyed my Tortilla Soup . Thanks !<->1
Horrible experience here . We had a large group and it took 3 hours for food to come out . They were out of most of the dishes and some of the beer .<->0
Love the food here , the buffalo chicken egg rolls are soo good ! Not super big on sports bars but my boyfriend loves it and the service is always fantastic .<->1
This place is outstanding place for breakfast ! My wife thought it was the best French toast she has ever eaten and the biscuits and gravy are to die for !<->1
Outstanding , definitely in the top 5 for best steak ever . Great service , great food , two big carnivore thumbs up !<->1
Today I was at the Venetian and stopped in for a lobster roll . Fresh , tasty with plenty of lobster . Simply awesome . There 's not much to say about the cole slaw . It has NO flavor . Service is helpful and friendly .<->1
Awesome place to have a kids birthday ! Service and food was awesome ! Lanette did an awesome job ! ! ! I will recommend to friends and family !<->1
Cash only ! ! ! Never understood why they make it such a hassle . However its always a good place to get curry & roti ! ! ! Love their roti ! Their drinks are refreshing as well . No reservations and gets busy during weekends<->1
generally very nice staff . great burgers for fast food . the drive thru tends to be very slow however many days . Some days are better than others though .<->2
4 different dishes all from different cultures done in perfection is a sign of an amazing place and chef ! ! ! Sooo much good food :) we were visiting and found this place of yelp and it was great choice<->1
Came here after paintlounge . Cute little diner . Had salad with grilled calamari . The house beer is a - ok .<->2
Pizza hut sucks I received a dry up pizza the manager never called me back and I have n't been back there since . Lost a customer for life<->0
Really tasty kebabs . I suggest Pitt people to try their chicken kebab , chicken Adana and their fried zucchini .<->1
Ryan was awesome ... breakfast da bomb ... highly suugest you stop in . Cool atmosphere Jetsons meets diner and sports bar ...<->1
This place is awesome . Pizza 's and salads are awesome . The veggies are so fresh . The service is very professional and the place is clean . Mos def recommended them .<->1
Their soups are fantastic . The service has been less than great when we have gone , but the good is excellent .<->1
So soooo good ! ! ! So fresh and every menu item I 've tried is delicious :) Staff are all super friendly and knowledgeable . Super happy to have this restaurant close to home<->1
Great selection of food , prime rib outstanding . Only negative you have to pay for your drinks at the table before you get them .<->1
Amazing and beautiful handmade chocolates , as well as fantastic ice cream ! My absolute favourite is the vegan gelato , Especially the dark chocolate . It 's to die for . Also their patio while small is very cute . :)<->1
I 've tried the Sour Cherry Pie and Key Lime Pie . The Sour Cherry pie is absolutely delicious . The pies are fairly pricey at about $ 15 . But considering the quality ingredients and uniqueness , I think it 's well worth it .<->1
Friendly staff . Always good food , obviously . The app works better than any other restaurant app . They always have my order ready quickly .<->1
UPDATE ; I was given a call by management and they took the time to make things right . Thank you very muck Kelly for being so nice .<->1
Awesome hangover food and at a great price ! We had the chilaquiles and pork ribs in salsa verde , both really good .<->1
Service was friendly . food was good . went for lunch , it took them some time to bring it out , but that s fine , makes me feel they are spending some good time making it rightnegative : very scant draft beer selection ...<->1
When I visited Las Vegas , we were really looking for a nice place to eat . I can tell you it 's more than a nice place , it 's clean , professional , the food is amazing . Highly recommended ! You wo n't be sorryLove it !<->1
The food here is amazing and everyone is so friendly . I walked in and immediately felt at home . Food is fresh and made to order . You build it your way .<->1
I was wondering why this establishment is taking so long to credit my bank account for a voided transaction dating back to Sunday September 11 .. ? Unbelievable ...<->0
Great little place in the Venetian . Our meal was a little expensive , but the service was great and the food was great . I would recommend this place if you are looking for some good Italian food in Vegas .<->1
Cool dive . Stopped in Thusday for a drink late - night stayed till dawn . Jukebox rocks . Did n't play but saw 4 pool tables big screen TVs . Thanks to the bar tender Steve , we had a great time . Will go back . Soon .<->1
Yes ! Finally tried this place out and it was better than expected . Such a cute and quaint ambiance and food was amazing ! Ca n't wait to go back ! ! !<->1
If you want a delicious Indian tradition modernize cuisine , this one will be good choice !<->1
Nice texture . Not that sweet and you can really taste the milk . Good o ecream overall<->1
EXCELLENT service ! ! They forgot the shrimp sauce , so they called to let us know ! When we went back to pick it up they gave us free egg rolls for our " troubles . " Amazing ! !<->1
The service is extremely bad . They took over an hour to have my food ready snd it was only a wrap and a smoothie . The guy before me waited even longer for a bowl of fruit !<->0
Only had a drip coffee but it was far better than most drip coffee you get elsewhere . Nice outdoor space and good wi fi .<->1
Such an amazing restaurant ! One of my favorite everything is made from scratch and taste great ! ! A must go ! !<->1
Good first impression . Sandwich was very good . I did n't order any of the extra sides but others in my group did . They seemed small but I was told that they were good . I 'll definitely be back .<->1
Got the grilled Artisan chicken sandwich . It was the worst chicken sandwiches I had ever had . The bun even smelt burnt . $ 5.89 for it and not worth ) $ 2.00<->0
Great food and we got GREAT SERVICE from the Oklahoma kid . Welcome to Arizona , we are lucky you moved to this great state . Keep your great attitude !<->1
We love momofuku for late night food . But we went there for dinner , the salad was wilted . The steak was so salty . Not a lot of positives except for the service . For a $ 200 dinner you 'd expect decent food .<->0
Course is greatly improved . Greens were great ... fairways much better than last summer . Great job ... the word needs to get out that the course is playable and fun !<->1
I wanted some pizza and I was in the downtown Vegas area . We found this spot and we LOvED it ! I highly recommend this location . I was very satisfied .<->1
A welcome addition to the neighborhood . With great quality AZ raised grass fed beef it 's going to hard to buy from anywhere else !<->1
Wings with the XXX sauce were amazing . Not too hot , just right . We will go back soon . Server and manager were kind and attentive . Thanks for a quality experience !<->1
So many chocolate goodies ! But since chocolate is my kryptonite , I exercised " some " restraint and did n't indulge . I think I did pretty good . $ 16 Groupon<->2
Sauce spicy and blan absolutely no flavor the decor screams do nt eat here plus the entire staff is moody not to mention chicken wings are 1.50 a piece a true rip off !<->0
omg the best place in america ! everything & everyone that is threadbare is amazing ! ! !<->1
Excellent Pig Dip sandwich and service was terrific . Casual with an upscale feel . The bread from the wood fired oven was delicious .<->1
Good sized breakfast burritos for $ 6 , all different flavors . Try the chorizo and egg .<->1
After eating Indian food every 2 weeks for the last 10 years , this is the best Indian meal I 've had ! Great recommendation , amazing naan and delicious entrees . Next time I 'm in this area , I 'm coming back !<->1
Had a mushroom cheese steak . Normally a very tender juicy sandwich . Not this time . Tough and dry . Trainee needs more supervision and training .<->0
Top notch bakery . Store is small , flavor is big ! The bakery reminds me of Central Market in Dallas .<->1
The closing time was 9 pm on Sunday and we were inside the restaurant a few mins before 9 . The sign said Open , yet they refused to take our order .<->0
Really ? ! Serve us a RAW burger and think nothing is wrong with that ? ! Will not be coming back here again !<->0
Really like this place . Seldom do I find a diner with a menu so simple yet unique . Fresh !<->1
Called to order a general Tao , very bad attitude , feeling like i am not a client but someone who is begging food . Was a regular with them but not anymore .<->0
Love this place , go here all the time . The breakfast is awesome and only $ 8 . Also get burgers , fish and chips , sandwiches , all great stuff . Big portions .<->1
Best place in Scarborough when you want a sandwich for less then £ 2THere are 2 subways now in Boro , this one is slap bang in the town centre . Great selection of fillings , quick and simple .<->1
Horrible costumer service . The manager Tamera was extremely rude to me . Never ordering from this pizza place again .<->0
Very sweet staff ! Got the Torta Cubana with beans and it was DELICIOUS . Their salsa was really good . Best part was that their bread is freshly made ! The entire family loved it . Will definitely be back .<->1
Excellent burger . The poutine was okay , but $ 8 is a little expensive . I will definitely order the burger again though .<->1
The noodles . You guys . These noodles . Insane . Thanks for the dude at Spring training for the suggestion . Heck ya . Go Dodgers !<->1
Loved this place . Great food and excellent service . I would definitely recommend . Har gao and shumai even though these are rather common dim sum staples . The sweet bun is scrumptious with oozing custard<->1
Very cute place ! ! ! We tried their frozen cotton candy matcha . It was so delicious ! Not too sweet ! ! ! It 's basically shaved ice with matcha powder , condensed milk and cotton candy !<->1
I went here for drinks in the downstairs bar area . The house special margarita was very tasty and the service was top notch . I will return !<->1
Great authentic food and service . Beautiful place and fair pricing . The food cake out fast and was absolutely delicious !<->1
Great place ! ! Very different but really good experience and food ! Cooking it myself was the best part ! All you can eat for $ 17.96 after 10 pm !<->1
They try way toooo hard to be something they are not ... Kinda like the girls you see wearing Juicy sweat pants in public with knock off designer hand bags !<->0
Great menu and location in Carefree . Black Mountain coffee has a full selection of breakfast and lunch entrées . I 'm telling all of my friends and the service is great as well .<->1
Best Thai food in Union county . Not to mention the friendly service and large menu . The placement may be a little inconvenient to pull in and out of when there 's traffic but it 's worth it !<->1
Chicken tikka Masala and the lamb Biryani was good the shrimp kasundi was bad the nan bread was also good and the service was good<->2
Definitely in my top 2 pizzas in Cleveland , and probably the most authentic to Napoletano pizza you can get in Cleveland . We 've never had a bad experience here . I 'd eat it everyday if I could !<->1
The best falafel ! Number one in america ! ! ! Thank you Moshe and Micha you are wonderfull ! ! !<->1
Since the management change , all the attentive and friendly wait staff is gone . The menu stays trapped in 1985 and all the charm is long gone . Not even close to being worth the time or money .<->0
The Greene House is one of my favorite spots . I 've been many times for lunch and have never been disappointed . My choice menu items include their Chopped Kale Salad , Yellowtail Sashimi , Fish & Chips , and the French Dip sandwich .<->1
This is my favorite bar in town . The atmosphere , the food and the staff is great ! The shrimp is a favorite of mine , and the pizza is unbeatable . Everyone from out of town visiting us requests musketeers pizza .<->1
Okay food , nice staff . The problem was with inconsistent ingredients at times . Has been very convenient for me and my wife as this place was a few yards from our apartment .<->2
It was good , but not extraordinary . I believe they rotate the menu frequently so we would go back to try things out again . It was very busy and they do not take reservations unless larger 8 + party .<->2
Just stopped in , first time , and ordered a breakfast sandwich . Best bagel , ham , egg , and cheese I 've had in a long time . At a great price as well . Looking forward to trying the lunch sandwiches .<->1
Yummy ! ! Ordered the asparagus from the grill , BBQ rice , spicy avocado roll and spicy prawn roll . Everything was fabulous . Unagi roll was ok . Wonderful atmosphere and great service .<->1
Good and predictable , awesome every timeGreat location in MGMSpectacular service and never a bad meal , always start with the truffle chips I Eat here whenever in town for business and in MGM<->1
Definitely worth the drive to Scarborough for terrific Cantonese food . It 's hard to find better than this downtown<->1
Always great food and great service ! Sad to see this place close to make way for another gas station . Hope the owners are able to find a new location !<->1
Hands down ... Best place in Chandler ! Great spot , great food , and awesome beer ! Love the rescue birds . Awesome spot ! Highly recommend ...<->1
loved this place ! ! Nice people , good food , friendly service . Wish it was warmer and we could enjoy the patio eating . Will come back again soon ! !<->1
Zen 's has relocated . Same uhhhhh how do I say this ummmmmmm same integrity as the last place .. same owner ... same uhh yeah ... that s all I got to say ...<->0
Food was good . Went at lunch time and had the sliders and Cuban sandwich . Our server , Gilbert , was very personable and attentive . Will definitely go back again . The valet was also very friendly and helpful .<->1
I am surprised people rated this place so high . I have visited the restaurant a few times and found the service are horrible . The food quality are okay at best . The only reason I visited is they open late .<->0
Nothing to complain about everything was very good including the coffee we ordered eggs and hash everything was just as it should be highly recommend this place<->1
The eggplant meatballs are to die for . The sauce is so yummy I wanted to lick my bowl . I love the chicken Caesar as well . Love the dressing ! ! !<->1
We came here for all you can eat and I was surprised on how delicious everything was . Great food and helpful staff .<->1
Amazing food , fast fresh clean . Tony the owner is a stand up guy as well . I recommend this spot for Greek food 100 %<->1
Great local brewpub , quesadilla is great and the local craft beer is excellent . I would defintely be coming back .<->1
This was my first time at the Canyon 49 Grill and I lovee the food , the place is heartwarming and I wish they have a bigger serving size from the price that I paid .<->1
Grub Hub blamed McCormick and McCormick blamed Grub Hub . No salad . No mashed potatoes . No sauces . Just the steak which was ok .<->0
Please do not eat here . My husband and I got food poising and had to go to the ER .<->0
The super six is amazing ! Sign up for the email club and you get $ 10 off on your birthday plus occasional discounts for different holidays .<->1
Very expensive , very stingy with the meat , but super bright & clean restaurant.nicest most polite & beautiful Black employees ..<->0
Excellent food , excellent service , very happy with what had over there ... Mary , ( I think the name of our waitress ) was very friendly and professional , and made my day .. :) . definitely worth to go back !<->1
This place is amazing , with me traveling , its a nice reminder of this place back home , all freshly made food . It was delicious .<->1
If you are near here and hungry , stop in . Place is great and I m not a drinker . The Fat Italian ( minus egg ) is top notch .<->1
Delicious authentic vietnamese pho . Fantastic customer service . Very big portions . Very cheap . Worth every penny . 5 stars ! !<->1
Favourite place in the city to enjoy a coffee ! And I have the say the owners are very handsome too ;)<->1
Visited for Glendale glitters . I had the egg nog latte . It was interesting . Not to sweet , it was made with real egg nog .<->1
Not reasonable price ! My family is 6 members include 4 kids ! They charged 18 % tip . but I could n't satisfied their service . Very slow serving food & no helping cook meat !<->0
Had very low expectations given some of the reviews read but despite busy lunch crowd , service was good and food solid . Easy in / out for business discussion with client .<->1
Totally in love with this tasty pancakes , even my kids want go back again ! Hope can opening another cafe in north York area .<->1

I had the Pappardelle Bolognese and it was heaven in a bowl ! ! ! I ate every bite ! My server Nate was very attentive . Such a pleasant experience . Thank you Gaspar and Maria for your hospitality and generosity !<->1
They are fast and food and drinks are solid . I have n't tried their pho though but the shakes and the rice dishes ( pork chops , chicken ) are crave - worthy<->1
Food is not the best . Salsa is watered down . They barely put any guac or sour cream on the food . No Bueno .<->0
Service was great and the prices were reasonable . We only waited 10 minutes for a table and 20 for food . Everything was flavorful and efficient . Highly recommend the truffle fries .<->1
Pho is great . The only thing I did n't like is that you have to spend at least $ 15.00 to use a credit card . Wish I would 've known that beforehand so I could 've gotten cash .<->1
This place is always on point ... great service and great food . Does n't matter what we order - it comes out hot and very tasty ! This is worth the drive across town for Thai food .<->1
We love Nittaya 's Secret Kitchen . So we had to try this one too ... Definitely not disappointed .. loved it ! Had the Yellow Curry & Drunken Noodles ... Both delicious ! Ca n't wait to go back<->1
Every time I / we go the cashier is very nice . We 've never had our orders messed up , and the food has always tasted great for something quick to eat . Also the box deals that they have are convenient and budget friendly .<->1
Great food ! Great ambiance ! Ordered burrito , french toast and cinnamon roll ... all were AMAZING ! Quick service and fresh flavors , recommend and will return !<->1
Tried once when they just newly opened . I think they 're pretty good we ordered the steak , red velvet pancake . I 'll try to visit again soon to give more details .<->2
So both my wife and I noticed immediately that the vegetables were extremely fresh . We totally love this place will be back in the future<->1
This is my favorite see foods restaurant in Scottsdale . Great food and service . We enjoy it . Thanks . If you love fresh see food this is the place to go .<->1
Pretty good experience . Got our doughnuts right away and employee was pretty friendly . So , in conclusion , Not bad ! ! !<->2

Great food and service . Recommend for any serious Vegetarians or Vegans . A regular customer<->1
Delicious ! ! Ca n't get enough of it . Almost sad to say i ate here 6meals straight . Their special cane sauce is so addictive ! !<->1
Omg . Best food . We eat there all the time . Love the masaman dish with steamed tofu . Also great is pad Thai and yummy egg rolls .<->1
We had their chicken souvlaki during Taste of the Danforth and it was good . They had a lively atmosphere and their souvlaki was tasty !<->2

I love this place , never had a bad experience here . Food is always good and hot . Also have a good draft selection .<->1
Great place for late night food when at NYNY . Breakfast items and burgers are better than expected for a casino casual diner .<->2
Great job , dive atmosphere , not overly expensive . Expected the sandwich to be slightly larger but still delicious . No complaints at all .<->1
Fun place ! Great service and amazing food ! Found this based off the yelp reviews and they wo n't steer you wrong . Got a smaller hookah for 10 $ since that 's one oftheir Monday specials !<->1
Delicious pizzas and best creamy garlic dipping sauce I 've ever had ! Overall friendly experience for me .<->1

What a great concept ! The salad was fresh and dressings very tasty . The Staff was awesome . Keep up the great customer service .<->1
Great January day to sit out side . The San dabs were great for lunch . Also the squash soup was excellent . Great service<->1
Nice Spanish food for the area . The bone marrow is amazing as most of the tapas . Service could have been better . Very nice atmosphere . Decent wine selection . I 'll give it another try .<->1
Our first visit . The steak was good . The chili , DENNISON 'S . I have eaten Dennison 's chili my whole life . I buy it at Fry 's . The service was very good and a beautiful restaurant .<->2
Hidden gem . Authentic and delicious Mexican food . They are incredibly fast . You ca n't go wrong with the sopes ( lots of fresh avocado ) or the chorizo tostadas . The guacamole is great too ! Love this place .<->1
Good eats . Forget the fake franchised BBQ chicken chains . This place tasted like I was in Kihei . The Kahlua pork was bomb .<->1
Our waitress was great ! Very attentive and helpful . Pretzel is delicious . I enjoyed my chicken sandwich but some friends did nt love their food . Overall a good place .<->2
I ordered their RSTLNE sammie as a salad and a side of their split pea soup . So flavorful ! ! ! I also tried their Pineapple Mint Chia fruit water . That was a meal on its own . So yummy and refreshing !<->1
A brutally dishonest business . 1 . Ordered an item . They attempted to charge me for a more expensive one . 2 . Friend ordered another item , same story . 3 . Repeated multiple times it 's to go , no forks . Buyer beware ?<->0
Out of this world delicious . When we 're in town we have to pick up a pie & their stuffed wings from this place . Staff are very friendly .<->1
Expect long lines and they wo n't let you order online unless it 's hours in advance . Unfortunately they take their time on the line and the quality of burritos are not even that great<->2
Food was good . It was a little dry . The staff seem to be having a bad day . They were constantly swearing . The waitress seemed lost . Pancakes were good .<->2
Great burger place ! So many choices and always delicious . Best service by Mallory she is super friendly and always gives us the best service !<->1
The drink was n't half bad , but its so expensive . I also had an issue where they sold me a rotten sandwich and refused to refund the money . I emailed corporate and they gave me back the cash .<->2
This place is awesome ! ! ! The food is sooooo good and coffees are great as well . Love the deserts too :) I do wish you were open a bit later each day as well<->1
Over priced ! Far too loud . Weak drinks . The food was just ok ... I 've had much better in TO .<->0
Good variety of teas , inexpensive and staff is very knowledgeable and friendly !<->1
This place pretty much sucks .. this is my first time staying in a old type hotel coming to vegas ... hooter girls were pretty much nasty.not like the ones out in cali . .. wo n't be staying here again ...<->0
These guys got a wheelchair ramp ! Same relaxing atmosphere the usual good coffee .<->1
Wonderful chicken shwarma with a warm delicious pita . The tziziki is excellent ! I 'll definitely be back . The restaurant is very clean , ample parking .<->1
They should have a self serve counter ! One may argue that the food is good . Besides that this place has just about the worst service possible .<->0
Very tasty . I really love Mexican food . Even though it was super authentic like grandmas cooking , it is pretty darn good . BYO burritos !<->1
Jin Jin restaurant highly recommend , not that big , but the food are really good . We ordered orange chicken , Sichuan beef and seafood delight , which are all really good ! Right choice to come ! :)<->1
If someone need beer at midnight go to brownies they r open 24 hours 7 days . Brownies sold all the top winning lottery ticket . They r top lottery retailer in lorain county .<->1
This is the best italian resturant i have ever went too . The drinks are good and the food is even better<->1
Great food ... quiet atmosphere ... definitely a good date place , esp on Valentines Day . I had the W & D Mushroom Ravioli ... Belgian endive salad ... both very good . The vegetarian options were clearly marked ( definite plus in my book ! )<->1
Great pizza . Sometimes when I order a slice for lunch it 's slightly burnt , but that does n't stop me from coming back . This has never been a problem when ordering a whole pie . I highly recommend stopping here .<->1
Good food , the duck with rice dish and bun bo hue were very good , excellent service , will visit again .<->1
Had nice dinner with my wife . Really good waiter . He was fantastic . Our food was as expected and we were served promptly . The fudge filled chocolate chip brownie was only negative , very bland .<->1
Best biryani in PhoenixI have tried many of their appetizers and paradise special chicken biryani multiple times panning several months and I have to say it 's been super delicious , authentic and very consistent .<->1
Great place to get your groceries . I prefer to go at 7 am . No crowds ! Shelves are stocked .<->1
Literally the best fish and chips in town . Great vibes and huge portions . Cash only but i do n't even mind it 's devious and fresh as heck<->1
Okay we 'll it 's McDonald 's food but ... during lunch they have a person standing outside to take orders . Line was long but I got through in three min . Freaking awesome .<->1
By far , my favorite place to each in Henderson . Their food is extremely fresh .<->1
BURRITO HEAVEN =) i always seem to show up with my stomach rumbling and ready for it to be satisfied ... ALWAYS works lol the menu is nt so elaborate but its enough for me =)<->1
Food is very good . ALWAYS SO BUSY . Parking is hit or miss especially on weekends . My only complaint is how loud it gets . I wish there was some way to lessen the echo and noise .<->1
Great pizzas and salads . Friendly service . Great wine list for the price and value . Love this place<->1
Trying to get seated . Can see tables and booths wide open . They said trying to not overwhelm the kitchen . This is poor management and horrible service . May leave to go to Danny Boys or Deweys Pizza .<->0
Quick and delicious . Got the steak and pastor tacos and added salsa verde for a kick ! Would definitely come back to try their other options .<->1
Crazy , How great these DONUTS are ... Allen and I only stop once in awhile but we are not disappointed ...<->1
I almost always get the curry chicken , and something similar to chicken satay for an appetizer . Great food , a little inconsistent , servers are nice and polite . The owner and her daughter can be a bit rude at times .<->1
Do n't order the beef tenderloin seared in a wok . Sooooo salty and 3 thin slices of beef instead of 1 thick slice . Also over - cooked . Honestly , save your money .<->0
Small family owned business with amazing burritos ! Homemade tortillas are fantastic . I highly recommend the chile verde burrito .<->1
Worst Culvers I have ever been to . Cold and overcooked fries . Bacon Cheeseburger cold , smothered in mayo and Bread was like a hockey puck . Returned it to remake . I will never return to this location again .<->0
Is this place for real ? If you 're looking for a small DIVE bar , then you 've chosen wisely . Food is super limited and they were out of Jack when we visited ! I would make another choice .<->0
Have to agree with Timmy ... located just off the 51 , it does have a Roadhouse feel to it ... Have n't been there for dinner , but the combination Texas / Arizona ( hence the name ) cuisine is pretty good fare ...<->1
It must suck to be vegan , this food is horribly bland . I got a build your own salad bowl and perhaps I made some bad flavour combo choices but will never eat here again .<->0
I do n't know vietnamese food , so I ca n't speak to authenticity - but I do like Xinh Xinh and recommend trying it . The menu is appetizers , sandwiches , pho , and boba . Reasonably priced and tasty .<->1
Never disappointed when we eat here ! Had the sausage , peppers & egg sandwich today - delish !<->1
Not happy . Fish taco had 95 % cabbage on it n barely any fish . Gave me 20 % discount . Hahaaaaa not getting that again but friends food was good .<->0
Seriously such an authentic little café . The associates actually speak fluent French and the food was delicious ! I will be returning to try the Nutella crepes .<->1
Excellent dinner and ambiance ! ! Not to mention fantastic wine list ! We enjoyed a great bottle of wine and dinner was amazing !<->1
First time here i m always looking for a vegan spot in vegas and they have vegan options ! ! I got one garden veggie and killed it and ordered another for my boyfriend :) please open a spot up in summerlin .<->1
Great value , friendly staff and super food . Limited menu but you can find something good . Their efforts to help hunger is awesome . A must try !<->1
Love here ! The vibes and the decor is very appealing . Hip with many beautiful and interesting patrons . Food is excellent and service impeccable<->1
Ordered from here a few times and they are pretty good . Sometimes the pork is a bit dry and occasionally they send rice when I ask for none . Otherwise great food<->1
Great service food was prep fresh and organized . I loved the shrimp tempura it 's amazing an a burrito<->1
Only after trying many other Indian restaurants did I fully appreciate how good Saffron Patch is . Between the great food , great service , and comfortable and charming atmosphere , I would argue it is the best Indian restaurant in Cleveland .<->1
Good selection of seafood dishes , mostly Asian dishes . Clean dining room , friendly staff , good service . We 'll be back .<->2
Nice unique ambience , real good food especially for meat and seafood lovers . Good service and adequate parking .<->1
Great service . Great selection . Great food . Highly recommended . Keith was an excellent host , more than attentive and very knowledgeable .<->1
Excellent and Flavorful ! We got the flaming fajita for two and was well worth the money and we willDefinitely return .<->1
avoid at all costs . a shit hole , druggies , and drunks lingering about this place.it used to be a great place back in 1965,66 .<->0
Went here for brunch recently . The daily vegetarian omelet was good ; the house - made root beer was excellent ; the french toast with foie gras , dates , almond butter , and maple syrup was awesome -- both conceptually and in execution !<->1
Stopped in when they were busy , ordered and waited for more than 20 minutes for 1 smoothie before giving up . Ended up asking for our money back - their excuse - " We 're not making them in any particular order " .<->0
What a wonderful date night spot ! Nice Mountain View , delicious food and friendly staff . Have n't had a chance to experience the happy hour on the patio but it looks like a fun time !<->1
This place is great ! ! ! - close to the Hoover Dam - nice room - complementary snacks - cool gift shop - good restaurantsA GREAT VALUE ! ! ! ( but we were really bummed out that pool and Jacuzzi were closed for the season )<->1
the best ayce sushi restaurant in town . great service and great food quality . highly recommend tuna naruto , something wrong , age dashi tofu and sashimi salad . check them out when you want to get your sushi fix .<->1
Nice views , great service ! Food was disappointing . Steak was on the chewy side and the sides were over seasoned .<->2
We had a superb lunch . Fun way to grill your dinner yourself and the waitress was great . Great place . Going back for dinner soon !<->1
They 're milkshakes are to die for ! ! I love the ability to pick anything I want . The kids menu is awesome too . Nothing scary for the kids . ( Grilled cheese , peanut butter and jelly ... ya know , the good stuff )<->1
Forget about the place and service ( which were fine ) and let 's talk about the food ! The Polish Boy was good , but the fried chicken was AMAZING ! ! And the sauce was killer !<->1
Les meilleurs bagel à Montréal . Impossible de trouver un bagel aussi savoureux ailleurs qu'à Montréal . Ça veut tout dire ...<->1
I will give a 3 stars because the good was good . I paid for extra avocado and did not get what I paid for .<->2
Mediocre burger and foodservice fries . What a below average burger joint . Any inspiration left the building a long while ago . Avoid .<->0
Great service ! The pies ( dessert and lunch ) are just delicious ! Perfect for snacking ! The green chili mac and cheese is PERFECT ! Oh and ask for the sour cream / ranchish style dipping sauce !<->1
It might just be me but the food made me sick . There was n't much that was good besides their fried rice .<->0
Great food . Breakfast all day . I highly recommend this place . Versatile menu . Something for everyone .<->1
Everything here is great . I have had the Tamales , Gorditas and the Tortas . The Pork Tamale is the best ! Also , the cubano torta is awesome .<->1
The beef Szechuan stew was amazing and addicting ! Very spicy , very tasty broth and the noodles were homemade .<->1
Always good food , nice atmosphere , and friendly service . The drawback is that you probably have to wait for a table on the weekends . But the food is delicious !<->1
fabulous women 's vintage clothing / dresses by 720 vintage . wanted to buy all of them . the coffee was delicious , and the barista was super friendly . nice selection of records for those into hip hop and soul .<->1
Great food , service and value ! Their salmon dish is delishous !<->1
First time at SkinnyFATS , I ordered the Classic Burger cooked medium rare with truffle fries . Everything was cooked as ordered and I love the pineapple ketchup . Priced for the burger is under $ 11 .<->1
Breakfast at this place is fantastic ! ! ! A wide variety of dishes with a pancake flight that is 2nd to none ! Their Nutella and banana pancakes are to die for ! ! !<->1
Awesome pho . The Bun Cha Gio ( vermicelli ) was really good too . Poppin spot . Portions are HUGE . The medium is well enough for a grown man . This is OG Viet food .<->1
Fantastic atmosphere and mouth watering food . Absolutely wonderful service with a beautiful view . A Pittsburgh must .<->1
Yum ! ! Best Mexican food in town . I love the different enchilada sauces and the Macha appetizer !<->1
Huge burritos but I think the veg ones kinda lack taste . The beef is good though .<->2
I love Dark Horse . It 's my morning routine . Lattes are fantastic and I 'm obsessed with the lemon scones ! The customer service is friendly and the atmosphere is relaxed if you can avoid the morning rush .<->1
I ordered the fried chicken and Brussels . The service was great and the food was amazing . The Nutella Cake was delicious and I will for sure be back .<->1
Expect long waits during weekend . Service sucked . You have to ask for everything and no designated waiter . Rice , utensils , napkins , - had to ask for . Overall food was okay compared to other dim sum places in the area .<->2
Stopped for coffee and bagel this mornin . So glad I did , if u get a chance check it out .<->1
They do n't wear gloves . The two greek guys were handling my burger with their BARE HANDS ! ! Luckily , I did n't get sick .<->0
Do yourself a favor an order a " Mey - Thai . " It 's not on the menu , but it 's a half - tofu , half - four bean medley pad Thai on rice .<->1
Best Denny 's I 've ever eaten at . Delicious food and very friendly staff . I suggest going during the day . I had one bad experience going late at night , but the multiple great experiences during the day canceled it out . Strongly suggest :)<->1
Great seafood ! You ca n't go wrong when you order the special . Great selection of bourbon and scotch , Beautiful wine list .<->1
Food was piping hot and delicious . The mint tea was quite a surprise . The creme brûlée was awesome - definitely worth the calories . The staff was very pleasant and attentive . Will go here again .<->1
like a mediterranean chipotle . really good portions for the price<->1
Great place ! Love the relaxed atmosphere , place to interact with people enjoy a glass of wine , etc .<->1
Primoz Pizza is hands down the best pizza in Cleveland . Highly recommend if you are in the area .<->1
the cheesesteaks are pricey but they are the best in town , chicken cheesesteak is great too . no , they do n't compare to Pat 's but we 're in vegas .<->1
Love to come here to buy my rice & spices in bulk . Plus the naan is always good . I can always find something new to try .<->1
I was really looking forward to trying this restaurant out and was sadly disappointed . Waffles were rubbery . Not sure if I 'll come back . Service was n't great either<->0
Awesome drinks and food . Great spot before or after a suns game and they have live music most nights<->1
I really expected great things from this place ! Super sad it was n't delivered . I got the Rancher . Everything was underseasoned . The chicken was boiled - - hard to chew and seriously lacking any flavor . Salt people ... Use the salt !<->0
They have amazing cookies ! ! I also am a huge fan of their bagel sandwiches . I would recommend this cafe !<->1
Had white fish sandwich for lunch . Yelp said it was n't open but it was . Decent price . Had branzino instead of the white fish on the menu .<->1
Best funnel cake ever . I drive 30 minutes to get their funnel cake . Their ice cream and strawberry sauce is perfect too .<->1
Great service and great place to try Cuban food for the first time . They get their liquor license in June ; ca n't wait to try their mojitos .<->1
Spicy pork tacos are a must try ! ! ! The best $ 2.00 tacos money can buy .<->1
Delicious street tacos . $ 1 Taco Tuesday special . Clean and bright modern space with great murals on the walls .<->1
The food was good it was a little expensive for me just the two of us me and my son and it cost us $ 100 and we just drink soda but like I said the food was really good .<->2
Absolutely awful . Rude employees . Stopped in at 940am and they had no food . Every station was shut down . Why even be open if there is nothing to serve anyone ?<->0
Cute little cafe in downtown Brampton . Daniel is an amazing entrepreneur , so much fun ! Visited there on my daughters birthday and she got a free tea .<->1
I like the people who work here , in general . But it 's consistently understaffed and takes literally forever to get an iced coffee out . Hire more people . Notoriously the slowest Starbucks I 've been to ... And I 've been to dozens .<->0
Gutes , frisches , aber geschmacklich nicht herausragendes , Essen . Schönes Enterieur , das einen etwas gehobenen Anspruch vermuten lässt . Da überrascht die Größe der Portionen und das damit einhergehende Preis Leistungs Verhältnis wirklich positiv .<->1
Pork was well seasoned and marinated . Presentation was good and taste was good . Prices where great and the quantity could have been more . Service was polite and quick .<->1
Good Chinese food , really enjoy the Kung Pao and the pork fried rice . One of the better Chinese restaurants in North Phoenix . The hot and sour soup has some whole shrimp in it .<->1
Awesome fresh sandwich ! Had the Tuscon and the entire thing was delicious . Minus a star for the flavored iced teas - a little too diluted . But yeah , this is what a $ 10 sandwich should taste like !<->1
Food quality I would give it 4 stars . Unfortunately it 's expensive , and hard to book a table ( granted , biz is too good ) . I hope the price would come down , otherwise it 's not likely that I 'll go again .<->2
Interesting hangout place with very trendy interiors for late night lovers . Good options for quick French bites and beer lovers .<->1
My favorite was the salad dressing . Also everything was fresh and clean . Would come back for a quick meal .<->1
Shellys has Wonderful pizza ! This Is a must on pay day . My daughter does n't eat any other pie then this one . My husband is addicted to it lol ! Go and find out for yourself you will not be disappointed .<->1
This restaurant has been closed for a few years . If you are looking for the recently opened Tamarind in Matthews , NC please follow our link for location and hours.tamarindmatthews.comFB , Tamarind / / Fine Cuisine of IndiaIG , tamarind_matthews<->2
Super clean , super fast , they got my order perfect , and the staff was VERY kind . More than I would every expect from a fast food joint . Also , the restrooms were spotless !<->1
The only good things about this place is the service and the guacamole lol the food is not authentic and bland ...<->0
Very good sweet potato fries . The avocado chicken sandwich was very good . A little pricey for what it is , but a solid choice .<->1
The food is outstanding . Better than we expected . Service was prompt and very courteous , drink we 're very well made .<->1
Just got here as Yelp says they are open , they are not open on Mondays ... Will definitely come back I love Greek food . So dissapointed ... Will put 3 stars just for now will do a review , next time !<->2
Poorly prepared food and tasteless . I ordered the chicken tacos . Chicken was dry and not marinated . Concession needs to shut down<->0
Best place to get burritos in Mississauga . Nothing comes close . The environment is nice and subtle . All the staff is very nice and easy to have a conversation with . Definitely recommended !<->1
El peor servicio al cliente , desagradable uno de los empleados que aparentaba ser o gerente o el dueno . Para nada recomendado no saben como tratar un cliente .<->0
decent ramen especially for the price . thin noodles but a bit too soft , kuro black garlic strong , broth ok including regular tonkotsu which lacks full depth , gyoza falls apart too much , wrapper could be better .<->1
The duck is fantastic and the pad Thai is some of the best I 've ever had . Great service , nice atmosphere .<->1
Le fusion n'existe plus . Il a été remplacé par un restaurant asiatique nommé : " Jardins des délices " .<->1
Love it here ! Schuyler , Richard , Dylan , Rob and Amanda are always welcoming , play good music and make amazing coffee . It 's a nice and quite which makes it the perfect study place , I 'm here pretty much everyday now .<->1
Once again just terrible , worst pickle barrel in Metro Toronto stay away . Bad service hostess is a joke.restaurant us dirty , just walked out disgusted .<->0
Best wings I 've ever had ! ! Drove in Cali and was pleasantly surprised ... Ca n't speak for the rest of the menu but the wings are ridiculous<->1
Good food and services . I had the grilled lamb kabobs . Low key ambiance , I would definitely come again .<->1
It is delishuuuus . And nice service ! ! Really nice decore and clean placeShort time waiting on food , cashier nice , friendly and patient<->1
The team does a great job of cooking real eggs in kitchens . DD and starbucks do n't have kitchens . Love how friendly the staff is and the fries are all natural Idaho potatoes . Cooked in all vegetable oil .<->1
The salad bar is a complete rip off . $ 10 for a TINY plate , it 's like they are discouraging customers from making healthy choices<->0
My go to hotpot spot , perfect for the chilly weather or when you 're craving soups . Can accommodate big groups on short notices as well<->1
Best Chinese place I 've had so far ! Food tastes really fresh and unique . Nothing like panda !<->1
Like having a healthy choice in concord area . I was pleasantly surprised to find a nice bar . Staff was very friendly . I was bummed at the limited offering . I was hoping for more vegetable juice offerings .<->2
Really freakin awesome Happy Hour ! This was only my second time going here for HH as I m usually either working or with HB . Awesome drink specials !<->1
For a late night dim sum . This place is okay ! Service could be better . But the food is pretty Good . Remember you can not pay by debit . Cash only .<->2
Love love love this place . Fried rice is very good . Try the spicy pad thai noodles . Listed as Pad Thai shrimp in the attached picture , but it is so much more . It has chicken , shrimp , and is delicious !<->1
I love it here and its very clean nice and very good food to eat ask for Shane or Seth there very nlce .<->1
Met a friend for dinner at this location recently . She had the protabella mushroom burger and I had the fish tacos . GREAT food ! ! Ca n't wait to go back . The tables were comfortable and the atmosphere was warm and exciting .<->1
I 've tried a lot of Mediterranean places and by far this one is the best ! ! Also , the best service of all time !<->1
I am impressed with the ambiance , this is the only place in cleveland where servers wear kimono ! Tempura , sushi , udon are great ! !<->1
Love this place . Great service , great food ! ! We come so often the waiter recognizes us . If you want great ramen at a good price come here .<->1
Great plce to grab quick bite , fresh food , modernized new way of service healthy food , enjoyed every bite . Sure will be coming back<->1
Great food ! Recommend the Thai ribs and the kale salad . Beautiful restaurant and a nice experience overall . Honestly , some of the best ribs and salad I 've had in a long time .<->1
Tibet Cafe has the best vegan Momo 's , stopped by for a late night bite and split an order along with some vegan soup<->1
I went there last week , had the kafta - kebab sandwich and it was absolutely STELLAR , good bread and nice , spicy meat . The decor is whatever but for very good , spicy kebab , this is seriously excellent . I will definitely come back !<->1
Quick and friendly service . The food is consistently good and very fairly priced with large portions . I wish that they delivered - that is my only qualm but it is definitely worth the quick drive for take out<->1
? ? ?<->1
Good service great fun but I did n't get to play ping pong because of the rain and when it stopped they did n't want to open it up .<->1
Avocado egg rolls WIN ! Pizza is ok .<->1
The only good food is grill pork . Do n't buy fried chicken , KFC is doing better fried chicken that this restaurant .<->0
I 'm convinced they put crack on that garlic sauce , absolutely delicious . I 've ordered seafood and some of the specials , ( veal , calamari , cod ) never left disappointed . Service is nice too !<->1
Great pizza , salad , and wings for a reasonable price ! Service was quick and attentive . I will definitely be back !<->1
Ordered a steak kabob wrap & spinakopita and they were both Amazing ! My friend enjoyed his gyro wrap & falafel . Great service , excellent food . Will be back ...<->1
Just sat and getting Americano with honey drink , charizo and jalapeño corncakes , 2 eggs medium . Nice place . In or out seating . All excellent so far . Wow corncakes . Best I 've ever had . A new favorite breakfast stop for me .<->1
The food here is so good ! The service is great and so is the ambiance I will be dreaming about the food for months , it 's that good<->1
Love this place , good lunch specials and good food . I have never been to Philly , but for now this is as close as I will get .<->1
Very good schnitzel , thin and lightly breaded . The staff is very friendly , and we had a pleasant chat with the charming owner after dinner .<->1
Amazing tacos . Had the king taco which was mainly meat . Flavor was good . Not to salty . Wish it has come with lettuce and tomato 's though . You are basically just left with the tortilla and may . Still a good meal .<->1
The best for burgers ! I 'll never go to any of those fast food joints ever again ( McD , JITBOX , WEND , BK ) The Gyros are yummy too<->1
Great pancake or omelet place , wish they stayed open later on the weekends , it always has a 20 minute wait , but always great food<->1
This place never disappoints me ! Foods always great , no matter what i have tried , its all been amazing ! Love the atmosphere and the staff are so great ! Do n't forget to try the berry cobbler ... its beyond delicious .<->1

Boom ! Outstanding lunch . Ya got ta try the Falafel and the salad ! Oops , I forgot ; the baklava too . Will definitely be back . Thanks for the great service !<->1
Good for the ambiance and experience . Food just fine , but certainly not great . Not a wine guy , so the included wine carafes were irrelevant .<->2
Hubby & I had most Delish meal here last month . He stated that the chicken was better than chicken shack of Royal Oak Michigan . Phenomenal .<->1
Great little hidden spot for Japanese cuisine fix and sake bombs . Japanese Ramen :) Shhhh I 'm busy dranking and watching football . Servers are nice , need to know the menu themselves and the difference between the noodles .<->1
Nice and beautiful cafe and bar . Great ambiance friendly staff , great to get together for a beer or wine . Variety of dishes and main courses in the cafe<->1
The hamburgers are tasty and juicy . The egg on the fries does n't have a liquidity inside . Everything overall is great .<->1
The food was okay . Servers could be better . Also the heater was nt working so it was freezing in the restaurant , I had to eat with my jacket on . I will not be coming back here .<->0
Nice atmosphere . The pork belly melts in your mouth , the salmon was delicious , and the octopus was fantastic . I do n't know that the wagyu steak was worth the price , though .<->1
Definitely , a good place to have your breakfast or brunch . Their soups are amazing . Meatballs are HUGE and are about as good as meatballs can be . Pasta made fresh every day .<->1
I have been to plenty of Sprout 's but this one is one of the best . Always clean and the staff is easy to find . Only complaint is to watch out for all the old people driving in the parking lot !<->1
Amazing food great service ! Delicious coffee ! Cool atmosphere . Get the blueberry pancakes ! ! Juevos rancheros and avocado toast are also delicious !<->1
bomb.com . I love the coffee and the feel . Cool staff . Simple syrup is in a Bulleit bottle . Awesome .<->1

Amazing customer service . Very quick service . Waiter was friendly and gave us ideas on where to go . Knowledgeable on the surrounding areas . Food was perfect as always at any location .<->1
Bonne ambiance . Excellent pour les rendez - vous d'affaire . Menu accessible ( même pour les enfants ) . Prix raisonnable ... Seul hic , le fondant au chocolat n'était pas fondant .<->1
I often come to this place with my Chinese friends . Foods are great ! But sanitation is somehow scary . I can literally see the insects hanging on the table . Other than that this place is good !<->1
Always great food and service , you just ca n't rule this place out ever . Great drink and warm / cozy ambience , I 'm a fan !<->1
Needed to add a side of cheese . Since it all melted away by the time it got to me . Although it was still yummy<->1
Way under staffed and incredibly slow service , especially for a Saturday night .<->0
What can I say ? I 'm a butter crust bitch . Service was actually pretty impressive considering how ridiculously busy they are .<->1
Amazing place ! Cookies were fresh and so good ! The ice cream was great ! The young man who was serving was kind and fast . The ice cream cookies are amazing and a great price . It is a must go to place !<->1
Lunch special ! This place is awesome two drinks and two meals for under 25 $ and everyone seems friendly here . :) food is great . Alittle spicy ;)<->1
Awesome place . Had the pork sandwich . Awesome BBQ . Awesome sauce also had the home made lemonade . Highly recommend .<->1
Omg .. this place is going to make me so fat ! ! Girl working the counter had no personality at all .. looked like she hated the place but it was good !<->1
Food was good , I think they will do fine here , clean atmosphere and the service was great<->1
Tired of this now ! They never get my order right . Missed cream cheese once . Asked for my bagel to be toasted and they do n't do it ! Is this how you guys manage your stores ?<->0
Great service .. Kind of hidden but yummy chips and salsa ! Very clean place ! Fresh chips , not old oil tasting ! Highly recommend the carne asada tacos and quesadillas !<->1
Went during happy hour . Prices significantly cheaper and just small plates . Guacamole was amazing ! ! Bartender was excellent , taught us a lot about tequila .<->1
Wow , this place is great ! The turkey and avocado sandwich was so yummy . My husband had the French Dip ... but the homemade chicken noodle soup is amazing ! So glad they 're here !<->1
Really fun and confery place . I love the difference here . Very relaxed and easy to ' adult ' ;) Sometimes you just want to be in the big girl crowd . And not have drama around . Love it here .<->1
Decent and fresh , if somewhat overpriced food in a cool setting . I 'm not sure I would go out of my way to come here , but I was grateful that it was next door . Service was excellent .<->1
The food is good . They maintain a HOMELY environment . The waiters are very simple and honest . They are caring as well . The food wait time was in acceptable limit .<->1
Went for dinner and got the tempura shrimp , sliders and kalbi burger . The shrimp chips and garlic fries were amazing and the burgers were superb . Excellent service , awesome food , reasonable prices !<->1
Awesome food . Fast service . My husband had never eaten Thai before and now he is hooked . We will be back again soon .<->1
Great food and great atmosphere . We will definitely be going there a lot . The bruschetta and pizza are fabulous . The service was attentive .<->1
Pretty good thai food in the scarborough area . Definitely not a place for big parties , so stick with smaller groups when coming here . Pad thai , chicken wings were both delicious .<->1
So good ! I had their veggie sandwich and it was a perfectly balanced between salty and sweet ! Love the pistachio sauce with the beets . 10/10 would recommend<->1
The Syrah is to DIE FOR ! ! ! The staff is amazing & personable plus the patio is incredible with fire pits + blankets when it 's cold . Pro Tip : Try the breakfast wine on a warm day .<->1
Delicious bread and olive oil . Caprese Salad and Strawberry Salad were delightfully refreshing . Then there was the Panna Cotta and the Cannoli . Superb service and no loud music . Bravo Joey and Gina 's ! !<->1

Loving the donuts at Duck Donuts ! ! So many to choose from . First time here going to have to visit again .<->1
I 've never had vegan pizza before , but this was absolutely delicious ! I 'm glad I work downtown and this place is just a quick walk for my job .<->1
It was a nice little Japanese fusion cafe . It was a little pricy for the stuff they give you though for lunch on a weekend . The food and quality was good though .<->1
Loved the buck wheat flour , we got the special and the Lauren , both crepes we ordered were delicious !<->1
It 's a standard cup of coffee . Just a little annoying they do n't have soy or lactose free milk ... Not trying to be picky , just lactose intolerant<->1
Deserves the good reviews . Excellent bbq , jalapeño cheddar grits are amazing and I do n't even like jalapeños ! Would definitely go there again , well worth the wait !<->1
Straight fire ! ! ! This place is so good , it defys description . The carnitas is spot on and the plates are generous portions !<->1
This place is great ! Convenient for a weekend breakfast , free parking , large portions , great baked goods , and reasonable prices ! They even have yelp deals ! !<->1
Quite simply the best god damn chicken fried steak west of the Mississippi Rover . Side note the ice cold beer mugs make me feel like I have hands the size of Andre the Giant .<->1
Having been a frequenter of Rosa 's in old school Mesa , then the original Taqueria while the Rancho Tia Rosa 's was being built and finally the current Rancho Tia Rosa - - I can attest this is some quality food . Check it out !<->1
I think their falafel from the takeout counter is one of the best deals in North York for falafel .<->1
One word : phenomenal . The crepes are so good - all of them ! Not a huge fan of their coffee , but the crepes are da bomb !<->1
Food is n't terrible but way overpriced . There are also much better gyro places in town .<->0
The strawberry milk is delicious ! So fresh ! The staff is always really friendly and helpful ! Perfect for the start of summer !<->1
Light and airy spaces , wonderful and friendly staffs . Heavenly tea and pastry . Be sure to ask the staff to join the fivestars program , you will be rewarded !<->1
Tasty ! Great thin crust pizza , love the bruschetta . The sauce has a touch of sweetness which I really like and the servers are always good . Sometimes there is a wait but it is worth it !<->1
I did n't know what to expect and was pleasantly surprised . Friendly and helpful service to explain dishes . I got wantons in chili sauce . Flavors were outstanding .<->1
Great food . Great alcohol . Great prices . Went all over Phoenix . This was the best spot . A must . Oh and great music too<->1
Wings are the best around these parts . And the loaded fries have the other restaurants beat !<->1
It 's extremely disappointing to walk in for vanilla custard and have them tell you they are out and the machine is " frozen "<->2
Business did not consider party within " ale house " standards . Did not and will not compensate them for disrespect .<->0
It 's a great sushi place . I 'll definitely be coming back in my next visit . It 's a place you should try at least once .<->1
Best coffee drinks in Las Vegas . I started buying from Dutch Bros . in Oregon and was so elated to find they are here in Vegas . Staff is super friendly and drinks are made quickly .<->1
This is my families go to for pizza ! ! I think we get the babe Ruth every time and their wings are to die for ! ! !<->1
Jo , our server , was fantastic . Great service , food suggestions , etc . shrimp and grits were good , short ribs amazing . Popovers on point .<->1
Highly recommend the eggplant and fish ! Excellent and authentic Chinese food ! I can not eat spicy food but I was obsessed with their dishes ! Good for group ! ! !<->1
Good sushi and great service . A bit pricey but will return because of the quality sushi and service<->1
Best burger : Nothing compares to a 4x4 . Frys : the more you eat them the better they become . Staff : they have some secret sauce for finding the best staff . Staff is better than 98 % of high end restaurants . Love it !<->1
Food was good the sauces they service with onion stack not so good ... all in all great place for a great burger !<->1
I called twice for 20 minutes trying to place an order never got a chance to place it so needless to say very disappointed with the business<->0
This was our first time there . The food was delicious . I had the gnocchi with shrimp and scallop fra diavlo . We will be back again .<->1
Awesome atmosphere , tasty food , and SASA fries !<->1

Good service ! The staff so nice and helpful ! The food tasty good ! I love their Thai milk drink , and the soup and noodle so delicious ! The vegetable is fresh and clean ! Love it !<->1
This place rules ! I can still taste the banana bread pudding french toast ... so good ! Great brunch spot with great Japanese cold brew coffee .<->1
This was just okay . I 've had way better . Nothing special .<->2
Toujours aussi bon , le gâteau parfait est chez Cocoa locale ! J'y vais depuis 3 ans pour les gâteaux d'anniversaires et autres , je ne suis jamais deçu ! Pas trop sucré , riche en saveur , onctueux !<->1
The juices are delicious and fresh . I love The Apprentice cleanse . Three days of this cleanse is the perfect pick me up ! Their salads are tasty and the service is fantastic . Cheers !<->1
Great authentic Roti . Everything I have had on the menu here is delicious with good portion sizes .<->1
The NACHOS are the bomb ! Prices a bit much , and could do without some of the chaos that comes with it being on the strip but the locals dig this place just as much as the tourists .<->1
No problems here ! I went to this location for its 24 - hour breakfast service , i . e . after 4 am but before others are open . I had no issues here , and the special order was correct when I checked it back at the hotel .<->1
winner winner chinese dinner . Just like the SF location everything was fantastic . Server was very good . From the dim sum platter to the duck breast to the 2 desserts everything were was a winner<->1
Estos tacos son La Boma Caundo handas en Las Vegas downtown y LA gente muy ambile good people When in downtown Las Vegas these tacos are the BOMBA<->1
Save your money bartenders are rude they do n't make you feel welcome prices are a little spendy and did I mention or tenders are rude also I just learned they 're going out of business<->0
Great food ! ! Good quality meat definitely would come back if you like kabobs this is the place to go good evironment and very very clean establishment<->1
Friendly service , clean atmosphere , good taste and generous portions might be some of the reasons for us to host our friends from out of town there . We definitely give this LH a thumbs up ! ! !<->1
BEST Mexican restaurant in town ! The staff is friendly and there is a unique flavor to their dishes .<->1
Excellence . ... ask for Gregory ... he will hook you up at the bar him ... celebrating my girlfriend Barbara 's bday ... great jazz music on Thursday night .<->1
Simply the best ! ! Not only is their food absolutely delicious but their service is second to none ! ! Thanks ! ! !<->1
This place is badass it has a lot of yummy yummy authentic sandwiches and breakfast and especially awesome stuff from the bakery ... you have to go check it out ! !<->1
Krys is awesome ! She was a very attentive server and the food was great ! ! ! I got a waffle and it was so fluffy I could die !<->1
This is fantastic ice cream ! I highly recommend the rocky road with the double chocolate . Normally ice creamy is really sweet , but this ice cream is not overly sweet which is my kind of ice cream .<->1
Food was delicious and fresh . Reminds me of home ( Hawaii ) flavors . Great service from staff . Seems to be an excellent spot for birthday celebrations too . Portions were HUGE and prices were reasonable . Recommend this place for family and / or friend night .<->1
Ok , especially for airport fare . Two chicken Caesar salads for just short of $ 20 . Arrived quickly ( on a Saturday ) , tasted good . Go there .<->1
Just grabbed a great lunch at the bar , the food is so fresh and the employees have a fun sense of humor and are really nice and helpful ! The Tortilla soup is the best ! Yum<->1
This place is the BEST burger is Scottsdale ... I 'm also obsessed with the sweet potato tots !<->1
Great food , great service , but most of all great atmosphere . I love sports bars and this is one of the best in the local Vegas area ! ! ! Wings are amazing , by the way .<->1
A friend turned me on to this place . The food is top notch . Justine is a hoot . If I go too long between visits , I get withdrawls .<->1
Love having this little joint in our area - the breakfasts are great especially the pancakes sooo good ! The coffee keeps flowing and the service is so nice ! Great tunes , fun atmosphere - this is our go - to breakfast place !<->1
I have to admit I really enjoyed my chile - lime shrimp salad , but Joel made the experience great . If you 're smart you 'll request him as a server . Hope management realizes he is one of their best .<->1
Much better service Sat night even though they were packed . We waited 5 min , seated , ordered and had desserts - all within an hourGreat service , good dessertsIce cream and cheesecake is always a great combo !<->1
Service is flat - out bad .. even when tablets take off much of the responsibility . Food was mediocre .. mostly a temperature issue ( rolls were too warm , whereas dishes that should have been hot were lukewarm ) .<->0
I was wanting oysters on the half . And I got them ! Great service and a pleasant friendly bartender Tracy . I 'll go back !<->1
They have the best Italian pizza in the city , pizza crust is tender and yummy and their special kale salad is a must try<->1
Hands down , best burgers in Cleveland . Amazingly consistent and nearly every burger on the menu ( I 've tried many ) is ca n't miss . Truffle fries are great . If you 're looking for an awesome burger , honestly ca n't do much better than Flipside .<->1
What can I say wow ! ! ! the view the food and the service all 5 stars . , this place is a must for sunset dinner you are really on top of the world<->1
The food here is great , down home BBQ and sides . Service is always friendly and fast . The kids love this place . It 's not fancy but tasty and the best BBQ in the area .<->1
Too expensive - weird decor - limited selection - attentive staff but you pay way too much for the " privilege " of being there . Sorry but it has better choices in the area .<->0
Was craving flan so ordered one to go ... it was good but for almost $ 6 it was tiny ! If you 're gon na charge that much than at least give out bigger portion ...<->2
I 'm writing the review of The Cafe at the Drugstore while IN the Cafe at the Drugstore . Right after I just checked in at The Cafe at the Drugstore . How meta ! I hate technology .<->1
Hands down the best freaking doughnut I 've ever eaten and I 've travelled and eaten food around the globe ! I deducted 2 stars because they deducted $ 3 from my wallet for a doughnut .<->2
This restaurant is A - M - A - Z - I - N - G ! ! Best Sandia Margaritas I 've ever had and the food was delish ! ! ! Staff is great ! ! ! Wished I lived here so I could go back ! !<->1
Total dump . By far the most run - down place I 've stayed in vegas , and that includes crappy places downtown . The price does n't make it worth it -- you can better deals and MUCH nicer rooms ( or even clean rooms ) elsewhere .<->0
Great Place and always Great Specials ... Hot food , friendly drivers . Always call in and ask about $ 9.99 specials<->1
Great food ! Big menu , lots of variety . Everything made with fresh good ingredients . Inexpensive , reasonably quick , given its cooked fresh . Highly recommend !<->1
Had the large Angus beef and cheese , was pleasantly shocked at the size of it , I 've got a big appetite and it was filling for even me . Outstanding customer service , mind numbing sandwich . Will definitely be back again .<->1
The ingredients seem to be decent quality but they put very little meat in your sandwich . Also do n't care for the very dry and crumbly bread .<->0
All the way from Porto portugal lost off love ! Than you lubi great food and very clean place we loved the this place<->1
This ice cream shop is excellent . I 've been there multiple times now with my family . Every flavor we 've had so far has been great . The staff is very helpful and friendly .<->1
Delicious food , friendly customer service , but did I say delicious food ? I keep coming back to this place . In Surprise , if your looking for Pho , this is it . Enjoy .<->1
This Is a family favorite little place of mine ... I 've had many great dinners here with family ... Mexican Food , Margaritas , & Family ! What could be better .. Oh and they have a private outdoor patio which can spark up some really great convo 's !<->1
Our waitress Jessica was fantastic ! My buddy and I wanted to stop in for a quick drink / meal . We were promptly taken care of which made the atmosphere and experience more enjoyable !<->1
The beer was awesome . Great IPA and oatmeal stout . Food menu was overpriced ... $ 9 for a grilled cheese . But I 'll go back for the beer !<->1
Food OK but it took 35 minutes to get my food . The cashier just said " what can I tell you . We just got one cook " . Not trying this agsin<->0
Love it here ! ! ! Pet friendly , great outdoor space , AMA - A - ZING service ! ! ! Best Mexican food in Litchfield Park by far ! ! ! Great for special occasions , family friendly , great bar area , locally owned ! ! ! Best place in the west valley ! ! !<->1
I personally had an amazing dinner and experience . Our service and food were top notch . None of the food was life changing but still was really good . Would definitely come back .<->1
Delicious ! Visited on a Sunday around 3 pm with a friend and were the only 2 in the restaurant . Tried the pad thai and terriyaki chicken . Loved the huge portions , friendly staff , huge granite table and ethnic background music .<->1
My 3rd time here , and every time I 've gotten awesome service ! Such nice people , and the food is awesome and reasonably priced . It 's always kinda empty , idk why . I love this place ! :)<->1
Clam chowder - very flavorful and not high on sodium as other places . Linguine Alla Vongole - very good also . Overall , better than a lot of places and very reasonable prices .<->1
this food is really good i am not a huge fan of new food places but this place is great . love the service . i recommend the wonton soup and pork dumplings<->1
Fantastic service from Thynara , the Brazilian waitress ! Amazingly delicious food , fast and friendly service . I love her . So far the best I 've had to date !<->1
I m here on business a lot , so i eat out everyday . This is my favorite place in Toronto . The food is perfect , and the staff are friendly . I just can not get enough of this place .<->1
I love this place ! I only wish it was closer to my home . Service is always quick and the food tasty . Prices are pretty good . Plenty of parking .<->1
Sam , Sven , and all the vendors here make the market special .<->1
Thank you so much for the Fabulous Wedding Cake you made . It was very good and it was Perfect ! Your service and delivery was Awesome . Carlos , Gracias por todo ! D . Sanchez / Fresno CA<->1
The food is so good ! I crave it ! There is a reason why they are busy . Staff have always been friendly . Just go !<->1
Good delivery when we do n't want to make pizza and wings ourselves . Wings are different for sure . Pizza is good . No bad experiences so far .<->1
The food was okay , not overly exciting . The daiquiri was not good at all but they did take it off the bill . Service was good and everyone was very nice . The fried jalapeños was good .<->0
Very disappointed in this Panera ... Customer service is awful ... Employees almost seem depressed .. Food is subpar for what we pay ... One particular item is the pasta .. clearly they stuck it in the microwave ... PANERA this location does NOT represent you well .<->0
Our favorite Mexican restaurant in Gilbert . They have a wide menu , from the typical meals to specialty dishes . The decor is adorable .<->1
This place is amazing with great service I will definitely come back every time I visit Vegas<->1
Ordered take - out so we would n't miss the Golden Knights . Great service and was very fast . Will be back .<->1
Very hip . The average age 20 - 30 , great / fun music . Food was amazing ! ! ! had the raviolis , tuna stack , and truffle fries .<->1
I absolutely love this place . Really good food . I recommend the general Tao and deep fried beancurd . Just look at what other people order<->1
Nice place , service is very good and food is pretty good too . They are very welcoming and make sure you 're comfortable and having a good time .<->1
Amazing Pizza , so fresh and flavorful . Tons of items to choose from , but I like my Pizza simple . Just some red sauce , pepperoni and pineapple . Time it right and you 're in and out in 10 mins .<->1
We were first timers and everyone at Graft made us feel welcome . Small but efficient food selection that was excellently prepared .<->1
Hands down the best buffet on the strip . Wicked Spoon is amazing , but Baccahanal blows even them out of the water . I ca n't imagine coming to Vegas again and not eating here .<->1
Love the food here the service is always great ... if u want good food come to the one on Charleston Blvd in Las Vegas ! ! !<->1
Absolut eine der besten Adressen in der Stadt . Sehr gute , zuverläßige Qualität der Speisen . Tolle Mittagsmenüs . Angenehmes Ambiente . Man bleibt sich treu und das ist gut so .<->1
Love this little hidden nook ! Such a great place to hang out and spend quality time with friends !<->1
Really good tacos , not enough meat . The place is a little small and not super clean but ca n't expect much with cheap prices<->1
Nice place . They used to be known for having some of the better wings in Cleveland . They are now subpar . Dry and chewy . Staff is usually very good .<->2
Have been here many many times and we love this place as it open 24/7 great fresh and juicy food , great selection of liquors and pretty comfortable .<->1
Vegan Soyrizo Burrito is amazingly good & I 'm not a Vegan . On a Sunday morning , it 's worth the wait & the staff is always friendly . It 's always clean too .<->1
very chill , great staff that pays attention but not too much attention ( if that makes sense haha ) . Sweet corn tamale is the shiz and so are the pig wangz . Go there , supper tasty =) .<->1
Always very busy . For some reason the cashiers get off at five and the number of registers open goes from eight to two . The staff is friendly .<->2
This is one of my favorite eating places in my local neighborhood the chile verde is killer service is good and it 's always busy , well prepared well presented and efficient service ! !<->1
Nice atmosphere , but it 's smells weird from the combination of hookah smoke and food .<->1
Love this place ! It is delicious ! Every item we tried was better than the last ! Amazing staff , food and ambiance ! Great for romantic dates ! A + + + !<->1
Great upscale tex - mex cuisine and great service as always . I always leave with food as the protions are generous . The apple pie dessert is phenomenal ! !<->1
Amazing . Fantastic service , food , and ambiance . Can ' t wait to return .<->1
I was so happy to find this new , organic restaurant with the most delicious soup , fresh squeezed juice , sandwiches and salads today ! And they deliver if your order is over $ 50 - during lunch ? !<->1
Nice stylish place . Totally mixed Asian food ? ! ?<->2
Great fro yo in buckeye ! They always have different flavors and plenty of toppings ! They also offer occasional discounts as well which is great . The only downside is the seating there is n't a lot of room .<->1
Love the food here but the service is horrible ! There does n't seem to be any order in which section the waiters worked in . They rush us thru order ... and then u have to flag them down if u want anything else .<->2
Dimsum is top of the line but discovered discrepancy in bill by $ 20 - . Strongly suggest you meticulously review each item ordered ... those chinese characters can be deceiving ...<->0
Great Service ! Friendly people . Plenty cold beer choices ! 10 cent first Mimosa and very good Bloody Mary bar !<->1
Very slow service . Not A variety flavor options . Quality is not worth the price . My order was messed up along with my friends order . I appreciated that they replaced it but it was after I negotiated with them .<->0
TWO WORDS : BUTTER TARTS ! Love the Maids Cottage , staff , owners and food - all amazing ! Highly recommend for anyone who has n't been !<->1
One of my favorite restaurants of all time . Great ambiance , awesome drinks , just take my word for it you will not be disappointed !<->1
Had the carne and shrimp tacos , absolutely fantastic ! ! Get them with the red salsa to add a little kick ! Stop by if you are in the area you wo n't be disappointed !<->1
They have a solid track record with delivery to my home . The pizza and service is good enough to keep me as a repeat customer .<->1
FYI : The phone is currently disconnected but Starlight Cuisine is still there and open . You ca n't use a credit card either with the phone line down .<->2
I was lucky to squeeze a reservation . Food was amazing , especially foie gras dishes . Must try this restaurant if you stop by montreal . Make sure to call ahead to make a reservation<->1
Wish I could give negative stars ! This place was disgusting . Flys all over the place , and the pizza was as dry as California in 2015 .<->0
It 's a classic . Do n't go if you are in a rush or looking for healthy food . This is a traditional pancake house - no bells and whistles , just good breakfast .<->1
Delicious , Fast , Friendly , Quaint , Fair Priced . Everything you want in a low - key neighborhood eatery . More lunch specials !<->1
Just do yourself a favor and do n't go here . Worst customer service , food is always wrong and nasty and they charge for sauces .<->0
Love the monkey ball here , it is yummmmmmy ! ! ! My kids love the California roll and tempera roll .<->1
Very nice restaurant , good selection of food items , food served at correct temperature , clean and nice staff ... what more can I say ?<->1
Edomae - style sushi just like I encountered in my travels to Japan ! This is in my top three Vegas sushi joints . Just go , you wo n't be disappointed !<->1
The house chow main is awesome ! Changed owners a few years ago but still a hole in the wall classic for cheap !<->1
I LOVE this place ! Amazing flavorful falafel , I even got my roommate hooked on it . The falafel salad is huge and could absolutely make a full leftover meal from half of the salad .<->1
I came in hangry and definitely got served a great egg sandwich to satisfy my mood ... lol . The service was great !<->1
I 've never waited so long for so little food . Mediocre , incredibly overpriced food at that .<->0
Tangerine Italian ice and vanilla custard . ENOUGH SAID ! Best dessert I 've ever had . They call it the gelati and the combinations are endless . Friendly staff and delicious desserts , def recommend !<->1
My food was fine , but the price paid for it is abominable . A small plate of penne was $ 23 . Will not be coming back unless someone else is buying .<->0
Awesome food ! Tasty ! Fresh and ca nt beat the prices ! Their special menu is good ! Salad bar is awesome<->1
My kids love coming here after i go workout and now they even assume that every time that we come to the gym we should stop and get a salmon teriyaki bowl .<->1
Had a party today , LOL came through with my last minute party planning needs . Keylin was a great host and made sure our party and guests had a memorable time . Thanks LOL kids club ! ! !<->1
What a delicious place to be . AMAZING Steaks , sides , appetizers . The place is beautiful , and screams high class , the chef is so nice and accommodating truly world class experience . Try the ox tail ravioli , the bone marrow , the potatoes .<->1
Quick service , friendly , and always consistent . I stop by on my way to my son 's soccer game to get my canine fix .<->1
I will come here every single time I am in town .. the place won my heart over as soon as I walked in and made my stomach so happy . Worth every penny<->1
Very cute little place . Absolutely delicious waffle ! And the stack of Nutella cans is mouth watering :) )<->1
Definitely try the Hainanese Chicken ( similar to JackPot chicken but less expensive ) . Already had it three days in a row because it 's so good .<->1
I 've tried their other chicken flavours . But I 'm hooked on their calypso chicken The service is nice and quick and just your typical fast food but the food is honestly amazing<->1
This place to me is just " Eh " , not the best BBQ in town by any stretch of the imagination . And when we went they did n't have Mac n Cheese , which is the thing I was most looking forward to .<->2
As always the pizza is awesome . Chicken cesare salad ca n't be beat . Good draft selection .<->1
Excellent service . Food was excellent . Recommend the butternut squash pasta , pan fried eggplant and try the macaroni bites ! Had a great time . Mariah our server was superb !<->1
Absolutely amazing food . Friendly atmosphere . We live in town and love this place . Will definitely be back soon ! !<->1
Yinz do n't know what the hell you 're talking about , or order the wrong dish . Do yourself a favor order the Lemon Chicken with seshwan * sauce instead of lemon sauce ... Thank my later<->1
Mad - Mex does not serve Southern Fried Catfish , but they do have Tex Mex .<->1
This is a great neighborhood bar with an amazing selection of microbrewed beers and an original , different take on bar food .<->1
The food was good for the price . The Mac was good , but everything else was mediocre . The best burger in Las Vegas was good but it was meat loaf , not a burger and for that I am disappointed .<->2
Service is impeccable , food awesome , and the atmosphere delightful a must for the family and kids .<->1
For about 7 bucks you can share carne asada fries because they give you a pretty nice sized portion ! Plus you ca n't beat the 24/7 business hours for that late night , 2 in the morning munchies attack !<->1
Best Teriyaki Chicken in town . Period . I have been to many Japanese restaurants and nobody comes close !<->1
4 almost 5 stars . Their Oktoberfest knocked my socks off : rich , smooth , and delicious . A great Fall beer that makes an impression . Cleveland does beer right . thumbs up !<->1
No idea if the food is good but the live music is true new Orleans . Only here for less than an hour , but the service was great and the music is real .<->2
Good , quick stop to get some food . Grab a bowl you like and add meat to it if you want .<->1
Fresh fish but way too over - priced . Overall , the location , environment , food all are decent .<->0
People this is coffee not brain surgery .. I drink OK cofee .. and let 's admit Starbucks is warm swill . there is room , music , and wifi . This is not the Met . so relax coffee Nazis<->2
The food is halal , perfectly seasoned , and beyond delicious ! Service is good but they are a bit skimpy on their toppings . Atmosphere is decent .<->1
Very good , approachable Indian food . Staff is very friendly , but service seems to be a bit off . Not sure if they just do n't have enough staff , or there is poor training , or a broken system , but that needs improvement .<->1
Love it ! ! Food is wonderful every time and always timely ! Highly recommend carnitas , pinto beans , and jade red chicken !<->1
Amazing meal ! Great portions + delivery , just perfect . An add on to my favs for a lazy / cozy evening at home .<->1
Perfect hashbrowns . And dear god , the Carrot cake pancakes ... Mmmmmm . I think I died and went to breakfast heaven ! Every weekend I consider driving from Southern California to Vegas just for the Carrot Cake Pancakes .<->1
Very nice place to get Mexican food and drinks . The service is really fast and friendly . I particularly enjoy the chicken fajitas and chips here .<->1
How in the HELL can you advertise " champagne Brunch " for $ 11.99 and not serve any breakfast in your buffet or any champagne ? ? ? 1 star for making me walk far into you hotel / casino only to reject your " Sweet tomatoes " type menu ! ! !<->0
Came here for a dinner on a sunday and i must say the service and food was just excelent . Food came out hot and quickly , waitresses were polite and helpful . Would recommend and go back for sure<->1
Pizza is fresh and delicious . If you do n't mind poor customer service and old school dining area , it 's a good spot .<->1
This was the worst Taro tea I 've had so far . ! ! ! It was super diluted and tasted like water mixed with a lil bit of flavor . Do n't waste your money at this place ! !<->0
If you have n't been to ZuZu at the Hotel Valley Ho in awhile you 've got to come back ! Chef Tony is amazing !<->1
This place is amazing ! ! The food is great and the restaurant is classy .. different than I expected . Also Dillan was our server , and he was awesome ! ! Super attentive and quick great service . We 'll be back !<->1
Got my food and saw a live sewer roach moving around on my sushi plate . I GOT THE HELL OUT OF THERE IN A BIG HURRY ! ! !<->0
If you do n't like Sushi Brokers ... you do n't know good sushi ! { no offense , well , maybe a little offense haha } . Great happy hour , fresh sushi and original rolls - the lollipop is the absolute BEST ! ! !<->1
Super delicious ! Love the concept and giving behind this restaurant ! I recommend everyone come try it ! ! ! Unique tacos on their menu ! Love the decors interior as well !<->1
Definitely one of my top Korean BBQ experiences - including in Korea Town in LA . Hugely recommend bulgogi and short rib !<->1
The food was wonderful and service great . Debra was attentive and friendly . We will definitely come again . Try the sunrise sauce - awesome ! !<->1
Omg , the danish and apple strudel are spectacular ! ! ! The cinnamon bun and muffins are meh .. You definitely have to know what to get here .<->1
Fast & friendly service . The staff are really nice and helpful . But I think that 's most of them . This QT is one of the cleanest I 've been in so far .<->1
The food is really good ! Excellent customer service . Very clean and always feels welcoming . 10/10 would recommend .<->1
Cajun Queen is my favorite Cajun Resturant in the world by far ! The shrimp étouffée is to die for . The ambience and service are great as well . A must stop in Charlotte .<->1
I was sitting at the bar and the bartender was great He was super attentive and a great conversationalist . The food came out quick . The drinks were top notch . Great experience .<->1
Excellent chicken pita roll ! The salad was very soso ... But what a delicious souvlaki wrap !<->1
Attentive , friendly bartender , prime rib dinner was cooked perfectly . Music was relevant . I could n't find the wifi access . Atmosphere was vibrant .<->2
The customer service here really sets the bar . That , combined with the delicious food makes this hidden gem a recipe for success . I will definitely make this my go - to spot .<->1
Food was delicious , we got to go around the entire tower 1.5 times while we were there , great way to see the city !<->1
Great coffee and brekkie was $ 8 which was a great deal for 3 eggs , choice of sausage or bacon ( bacon always ) , roasted potatoes and toast . Very busy in the morning so be prepared .<->1
They should be open more often and have more employees . Delicious ice cream ! ! ! Awesome shakes ! ! ! Good prices .<->1
So far so great . Loving my bartender Morgan . She is the cats meow . Will definitely come back and try all the different yummy looking items I did n't get to today .<->1
I 've been here for breakfast , drinks with friends , and dinner with parents . Every time the service is exceptional , the atmosphere is unique and fun , the food is above expectations . Definitely a pillar of the new downtown experience !<->1
I absolutely love this place . Good food , service , great patio . I sometimes wish they 'd mix it up with the music , but that 's my only gripe .<->1
Fantastic food . Great cocktail service on point . Servers engaging . Flavorful food . Great Restaurant vibe beautiful wood work .<->1
Friendly , quick , and clean service for a late night take out order while staying at the Crowne Plaza nearby . The Moons Over My Hammy was perfect . Great for any late night craving situation .<->1
Fries were kind of bland and the coleslaw was just ok but the meat was very good . Overall , it 's a tasty place with good prices<->1
This place has some really good and cheap food . As well , free soda refills . I love it .<->1
Awesome place ! They have games for all ages and spend real tasty drinks ! Strongly suggest ! !<->1
I had heard many great things about Penzey 's , but it was n't until recently that I actually went to the store . After shopping around and smelling various spices , I wanted to buy everything in the store ! Great for gifts as well !<->1
You should put the Ellis on your list it has a friendly safe comfortable feeling and great food . Just a really nice place .<->1
Delicious ! Chicken Shawarma Platter and hummus hit the spot !<->1
Great place to eat in downtown Vegas . It 's a close walk from the hotels in downtown . Lot 's of variety for food choices . Justin was very helpful !<->1
Another great lunch at Flancer 's . Paul and his crew make you feel at home with their consistently delicious menu . Always a treat !<->1
Very authentic Korean bbq . The Kobe beef is awesome ! The bibimbop is great too . It is close to the strip .<->1
Awesome chicken curry and Mediterranean food in general ! Will return again , and again , and again ...<->1
Beautiful truffle ( truffle paste on toast with scrambled eggs and lots of mushrooms ) was quite fragrant . Each dish also comes with a fruit skewer ! Not sure if it is exactly worth a 30 min plus wait though .<->2
Great pizza , had the margarita which was fried to perfection . Too bad i do n't live here as this would be a regular place for lunch . Not too crowded at 12 noon .<->1
YUM ! ! ! Wonderful wholesome homemade food ! Truly has the " made fresh " taste . Cozy , simple atmosphere . Absolutely perfect ... From great salads to yummy homemade chicken pot pies . Good price . Good service . Excellent food !<->1
Great ice cream , creative servings , awesome staff , very affordable ! Worth a drive from Phoenix<->1
This place was just meh . Nothing stood out . We were the only customers in the entire restaurant and the waitress just seemed really bored and over us being there . Pretty disappointed .<->0
What a let down , I am starting to think Yelp is getting worse how it gives out stars . VERY disappointed .<->0
Great place for happy hour drinks and eats . Heard about the nachos and could n't wait to try them . Was not disappointed ! Adding carne asada was only a few bucks more and easily shared . Will be back for more .<->1
The mojo is finally back with Charles in charge . Food and service is now great again . Thanks Charles<->1
This place was a waist of my $ 27.53 i had the crab legs they was dry and I had the rice was cold and I left hungry never again would I go back<->0
Petit café vraiment cute quoique " crowded " . Viennoiseries et muffins sont super bons ainsi que leur café glaçé ! Ça rajoute un spot cool de plus à visiter dans Verdun !<->1
Great experience and great food . Waitress was extremely helpful with recommendations and was always around when needed . Crab cakes , spare ribs and the drinks were all spot on<->1
Probably the worst dining option in the MGM Grand . Went with four friends for a casual lunch , and each one of us were dissatisfied with the service and food . Avoid this place .<->0
Had to get a breakfast jack for old time sake . They do n't have these in NY anymore ... too bad !<->1
Great spicy pork sandwiches , wings , and PhoVery Clean PlacePrices are great ! ! !<->1
Love this tea house ! ! It is nice to have a tea room in the west valley ! Over 30 selections of teas ! Quaint inside and an awesome patio outside !<->1
I had a very bad experience . Service was lousy no reason why I have n't been here in over five years . At least my beer pretzels were good . Will not be returning to this location .<->0
This is now my favorite spot for all my smoothies . Delicious and it 's worth the splurge . There are so many different options to choose from .<->1
I love the food here . The people are super nice . Ca n't wait to go back . Had the etouffe and gumbo and fried oysters .<->1
This is one of the best Thai places I 've eaten at and is always consistent .<->1
We tried a Black Cod feast with lobsters for 10 people , it is only $ 388 , wow , Vancouver would be at lease $ 700 + for the same meal . Superb quality lobster .<->1
We came here for a drink and snack . It was pricey for small drinks and the nachos we ordered were huge but not very good . Atmosphere was kind of cool . , they have a volcano that erupts inside the restaurant .<->0
I fantasize about this place in my free time . Viva Chicken consistently puts out delicious and healthy food . Their staff is courteous , friendly and thankful . I suggest Viva Chicken to anyone and everyone in Charlotte .<->1
The service as slow . When we arrived at the restaurant we had to wait 10 min . before someone came and took our order . The food does not correlate with the description on the menu . Pros : Halal .<->0
One of my favorite places and must go when I m back home in the Burgh . Must try is the strawberry pancakes and home fries . You will not be disappointed .<->1
Eh . I do n't love this food store . It smells pretty bad . It also does n't seem like it has the best selection of anything . There are no scallops either . Plus they do n't de - bone their salmon .<->0
This place is n't worth even a half star . Owner and employees are rude . Food is nasty . Store is dirty . I have lived in Mahomet for 43yrs and I hate to say it but this store needs shut down .<->0
The only place that can make me drink a smoothie with greens in it ! I will always be obsessed with this place !<->2
My husband and I just dined at this restaurant for the first time ... EXCELLENT ! Great food , great service , very pleasant atmosphere . We will be dining there again !<->1
MUST EAT , whenever I am in Vegas . I crave this stuff and it never disappoints . Sweet tea is yummy and their lemonade is definitely worth the up charge . YOU HAVE TO dip your Texas toast in the cane sauce ! !<->1
Tim 's is obviously one of the popular places in Toronto . Came here for a late night snack and coffee and stayed for a few minutes to relax . Nice environment and fresh desserts !<->1
My new favorite lunch spot . Really close and convenient to UNLV . The food was amazing . The service was really fast and portions were really good . The orange chicken was so nice and tender .<->1
Great food , great beer and great environment ! Oh and the chips and salsa are some of the best in AZ ! !<->1
I walked up and thought to myself ' am I even cool enough to go in here ? ' But we did and we were . Great staff . Amazing food . Good prices .<->1
The best sandwich I 've ever had , and I make a killer sandwich . The homemade chicken noodle soup was also freaking mint . 5 Stars people ! ! !<->1
Love the food , they have some unique dishes and always something interesting for the special of the day . The roasted prime beef is simply incredible ! ! !<->1
New owners that previously were working at Thai Chili . First timer . I had the Pad Thai dish , delicious . Also tried Green Curry , also delicious . We will be coming back .<->1
This might be my favorite restaurant in Phoenix . So much flavor and so much is served . Although it can be pricey , it is worth every penny ! If you 're hungry , love rich flavor and kind service , you 're in the right place .<->1
The food and service was delicious ! ! The waiters are awesome . Highly recommend this place ! ! !<->1
Food is ok - but waiting 50 minutes for to go order is ridiculous ! ! Not a do over do to the wait time !<->0
New Filipino Restaurant in the neighbourhood , they 've been here for almost a year ! Good food , authentic filipino cuisines ! They 're best sellers are Lechon Kawali ( fried pork belly ) and Yang chow Fried Rice ! ! Affordable cost ! ! They also do party trays ! !<->1
The place is kind of small but very lovely and the ladies there are super sweet . Excellent service and great food !<->1
Food is very good . However very tight and uncomfortable as we had to share our table with others . Very busy , service is quick .<->2
My new favourite cheat day meal . So good I had the baked chicken burrito and I want to try the others<->1
Super bomb place . My girlfriend brought me in because she is all about it . It 's like an Asian cuisine version of Chipotle . You walk down the line and pick what you want . Highly recommended<->1
The service here is horrible and the food is mediocre at best ! Took half an hour to get a reheated piece of pizza and two warm sodas .<->0
Great home cooked meals . Great selection . Excellent ambience . Lovely server . 5 starA must try<->1
Love the Carne Asada with the Borracho Beans here . The Mexicali Mule is perfect to wash it down too !<->1
Wow ! Their burnt almond torte is a Pittsburgh staple , and the few other things that I 've tried from them have been equally delicious ! I highly recommend checking out this bakery .<->1
Everything was absolutely amazing - except the wine prices ... Food and service was wonderful !<->1
Great place to do work . Wifi connection was good and the atmosphere / layout is perfect for long term studying sessions !<->1
This location always smells like PURE SHIT . They need to learn how to clean their drains . Staff here is all college students who need an attitude adjustment .<->0
This place is terrible . ! Lousy service , no manager when I found hair / fuzz and rat droppings in food . Refused to refund money . Wow ... ! Do I need to say more . Eat at your own risk . !<->0
Amber was the sweetest employee ever here ! She is a definite people person and brightened up my day ! It 's SOOO hard to find awesome employees like her so definitely keep her happy !<->1
Excellente place pour manger un steak . Le personnel est courtois , les prix sont étudiés , l'ambiance est chaleureux ( pas bruyant )<->1
Cuisine délicieuse dans une ambiance décontractée . Vins délicieux et excellents conseils des serveurs . Le journal Metro en parle comme l un des meilleurs resto de Montréal . Incontestablement une valeur sure pour un très bon rapport qualité / prix .<->1
Really friendly service , awesome soups and salads , all good . Really liked the vibe on the inside too , not loud and dingy<->1
This place was alright . I had the menudo and was n't want i expect it . Do n't like that it is counter service . If you 're a restaurant then you should have a waitress or waiter .<->0
Look good place is clean margarita taste refreshing they also bring the chips and salsa fresh<->1
Just a great place to meet people and have awesome beer . Always running into local brewers and owners . Love the Monday trivia night !<->1
Absolutely love it here . The staff is good but the manager June is such a gem ! Food was outstanding .<->1
Food was great ! I especially enjoyed the laos style papaya salad it had great flavor and crunch ! The eggs rolls were good as well fresh and flavorful .<->1
A good selection of teriyaki and rice dishes , cooked fresh using quality ingredients . This has been a long time staple for me and have enjoyed it for more than 15 years<->1
Great burger place for sure ! The fries are really good as well . Definitely worth going to .<->1
Huge slice of better than average pizza . Had the Arrabiata slice . It could have used more jalapeño peppers . But I ca n't complain . Staff was pleasant . Service was fast . Slice was reasonably priced .<->1
A must in the area . Any sandwich is the way to go . Gyro especially good . Also Victory beer on tap .<->2
Delicious food ! Atmosphere is Cozy & Friendly . Great Service and a Welcome Addition to the Neighbourhood ! !<->1
The service was great and the food was better . Great atmosphere and totally affordable<->1
Yummmmo great pizza and fast ... Just moved here and already know this will be a go to place<->1
We ordered the T - rex poutine . Delicious ! I always have to get poutine when I visit Canada !<->1
Some of the best sushi and sashimi in the city , hands down . Great happy hour . The potstickers and crab croquette are phenomenal . May be one of the worst burger and frites I 've ever had . Beyond that ca n't complain .<->1
Such yummy food . Staff is great and so kind . Owner is awesome and very interactive with guests and staff . Sometimes there 's a wait but it 's well worth it .<->1
The best chicken in town hands down , and the sides , especially the biscuits , are the best , oh my ! ! ! When you need a fried chicken , mashed potato experience it does n't dissapoint !<->1
Not super impressed . Would take Geisha over Stingray any day , but Stingray is n't awful . Seems Stingray has a more extensive list of sashimi - type dishes though , which is cool for a change .<->2
Wow , they are fast ! Most people seem to dine in , but their take - out orders come super quickly . The prices seem pretty fair for what you 're getting , and I 'd definitely recommend the mango with sticky rice dessert<->1
The food is good , I loved the spare rib , place needs a bigger selection on seafood however ; I still recommend this place for dim sum .<->1
How can you go wrong with meatballs . It was mushy and had no taste whatsoever ! You ca n't say this is an Italian restaurant if you ca nt make meatballs . The sauce had no flavor it tasted like canned tomato . GROSS<->0
Actually pretty good Mexican food . I had the chimi with ground beef and it was great . The service was a little slow , but overall it was good .<->1
The new location has beautiful decor an the service is quick and friendly here and the prices here are fair ..<->1
Great place to hang out and drink some really good beer . The staff are excellent too ... they actually shake your hand to meet you and they remember you by name ! I ca n't wait to go back !<->1
This place is the best ! ! Home cooked meals in an old diner with great service ! !<->1
The food has changed and not for the better . I think it is under new ownership with new family recipes that are not good .<->0
Authentic Mexican cuisine . Attentive service . Cold beer . Extensive menu with concentration on seafood dishes . " I 'll be back " .<->1
Great food ! This is our new favorite late night spot , the rock shrimp tempura , tacos and chicken kushiyakis are my faves ! We 're coming back every week . , buy 1 get 1 house sake and $ 15 pitchers for happy hour lets go !<->1
Trash ! ! ! This has to be the worst wal mart in arizona . I have nothing nice to say . If i could give 0 stars i would .<->0
Still the best hotdogs in town . Super delish , tried new Gang Nam dog . Euro fries rock .<->1
Just moved into the hood and looked this place up . Ordered the Albany veg pizza and it 's delicious . Totally recommend . Delivery was super speedy and the price is fine ( esp since the pizza is awesome ) .<->1
Very friendly and prompt service even during busy time . The turkey and the pulled pork is very tender and flavorful . I would defiantly return . Very good local bbq .<->1
Underwhelming and far from fresh sushi . I had the chef inspiration with the green envy roll . The nigiri was nothing special . There are much better places to eat sushi .<->0
Always amazing food , fast , great service , consistently delicious . Try the Red curry !<->1
Really 4.5 . Great spot delicious ! I come to Vegas a lot for work and need a good local spot . I have found it ! You should take the time to stop in .<->1
Service takes forever . It is a pricy place just for boba .<->2
Great atmosphere . Fantastic patio . Tasty menu and last but not least half priced bottles of wine on Sunday . One of my favorite hangouts .<->1
Food was pretty good . I had the pasta with meatballs . Sause was good meatballs good . My wife had the lasagna she said she liked it . The food took a little time to come out but they were busy .<->1
I watched this Bakery on TV . They make amazing , mind blowing cakes . They beat Buddy . We stopped in this morning and ate some pastries . This is a must try ! . Price is great and staff is super friendly .<->1
This was the best motha effin panookie i ve ever had . mmmmmm gimme that panookieeeee mommy .<->1
The parisian hot chocolate was delicious . I also loved the chocolate caramel tart . It 's a very cozy place .. a perfect place for chocolate lovers .<->1
Ne paye pas de mine de l'extérieur et tout petit à l'intérieur mais ça vaut tellement la peine ... Nous nous sommes régalés ...<->1
I come her once a week and the food is fresh all the time . It 's easy to order , great service . I would recommend the French toast if your looking for sweet .<->1
Delicious ! Thanks to the staff who graciously made our late dinner at exactly 9:00 pm , closing time . Cauliflower soup , yum ! Fresh greens and proteins , yes ! Perfect Cuban sandwich , yep !<->1
Two words - Veggie Tacos ! They were delish , it was happy hour all day and the service was great . Perfect stop for a late lunch !<->1
The wait is terrible ! ! ! We waited for 1/2 hr for a salad and tacos .. Salad came with dressing we asked for no dressing . Then over 15 minutes we waited and left<->0
Je viens ici depuis 30 ans . Un bon resto italien , pâte et pizza , sans prétention à bon prix . Apportez votre vin !<->1
Very delicious steaks here with a nice atmosphere . The steaks are delicious with sides . Thumbs up !<->1
La comida del buffet fue realmente sabrosa , había variedad en cuanto a desayunos y cena . Los precios un poco caros pero vale la pena . Bebidas casi de todo tipo . Definitivamente volveré cuando visite vegas otra vez !<->1
Had the pad Thai chicken . And shrimp papaya with a side of duck eggroll . Great taste . Decor is awesome .<->1
awesome place to grab a few drinks with friends , great atmosphere with a touch of hollywood regency style . Great selection of craft beers on tap and friendly service .<->1

Chicken and red velvet waffles with grits were amazing ! Surprisingly good value for the quality of food and atmosphere .<->1
It locate between T & T supermarket and ZenQ and offer Taiwanese snacks , desserts and drinks . Their popcorn chicken are delicious as well as most of their shaved ice desserts . It 's a must to try .<->1
Always looking for a place with pizza by the slice , got two slices and they were awesome ! I was surprised how much I liked the slice with zucchini and squash . Good prices , nice staff , will definitely be back !<->1
We had a really nice meal yesterday - relaxing , more than enough to eat and friendly service . Portions are very generous - and tasty .<->1
Love coming to wbc . Great place to come for a great lunch or dinner . They always have different live music acts on the weekends . The best part is their craft beer . A peanut butter porter is a must try .<->1
I love the Carambas in surprise and this one did not miss the mark . Super clean inside ( no dust ! ) and really nice employees . Food was great as usual !<->1
Love the service and food . This place really has a family - run establishment atmosphere . Perfect naan and paneer tiki masala .<->1
Just give it a try . Anything I say will not do it justice . A perfect special occasion go to . This place will be on top for a very long time .<->1
The pizza , salads and Greek fries are amazing and always consistent . Delivery is always timely and courteous . The only place we order pizza from . A must try if you want really good food !<->1
My FAVORITE place to start a night out . Generous drinks , cute bartenders and great local DJs spinning all night long .<->1
Small place , short menu , excellent food . Unexpected to see a Korean place in the small town of Cecil , but very great to have .<->1
Exceptional sushi . My favourite in Toronto . The chef was super friendly and professional . The fish was exceptionally fresh .<->1
The place smelled like smoke right as we walked in the door . Ok beer list . Glass wine prices are high . Standard bar food .<->0
ordered from doordash . wayyyy better than pizza hut and dominos .. i will definitely be ordering from here from now on . pizza and crust was perfect and fresh . also , i got the 10 piece mild wings w / ranch , also tasty ! !<->1
This place has very mediocre food . the drink specials are the only thing worth coming for . It seems like the servers are treated poorly .<->0
Alway a very good lunch ... make sure to try the chicken lemon rice soup that is complimentary with every meal ! Opa !<->1
Been here for brunch for the second time . The vibe is chill , less posh - sterile than the Bethany & 16th location , which I like but just leans a little to the superficial for me . ANYWHO , i 'm a fan .<->1
Better people watching . My steak was over cooked but it was cheap enough to not care ! A great experience overall !<->1
Water Chestnut at night ( Thurs - Sat ) brings ramen to Arcadia ! Hands down a top 3 ramen joint in all of the Phoenix metro . Add their amazing short rib bao and edamame and you 've got the best Pan - Asian dinner around .<->1
One star cuz they had alcohol . Food was Absolutley awful after waiting 45 mins . Wo n't be back<->0
Amazing Sushi and Sashimi , great atmosphere and open until 4 am ! ? ! Best Sushi restaurant I 've ever been to in Vegas !<->1
I 'm from CA and was looking for Mexican food , this was not exactly what I was looking for , but better . Great food .<->1
Great dinner , pulled pork , bbq beans , fresh cut fries . So good ! Good beer selection . Only regret - they were out of peanut butter pie with pretzel and oreo crust . Will be back .<->1
We go to this outback quite often and can rarely find anything to complain about . Last nights steak was delicious and our server Tyler was friendly and quick . Great family place :)<->1
I 've been here a couple times before but this time the food was tasteless - all $ 40 of it . The delivery was on time but not sure if I 'd be willing to take a chance on the food again<->0
This place is awesome . First time in years i ve had a great cheese steak ! Cheese fries are great too !<->1
One bite , everyone knows the rules . Overall an 8.75.Service was initially slow , but the food and price made up for the slow start . Will return<->1
Worst patty melt ever . Giant slice of toaster toasted bread with meat patty to cover half the bread and teaspoon sized fried onions and cheese .<->0
The donut flavor selection is amazing . The coconut cream one is one of my favorites . The lady that usually works there is very nice and threw in a free little donut hole which was super nice . Will be back again !<->1
Food was excellent ! The restaurant decor and environment was super friendly ! I would say that I did feel a little rushed by my server even though they were n't particularly busy . Otherwise , it was an enjoyable experience !<->2
Sat at the kitchen counter . Went with the improv . Food was phenomenal and the chefs and staff were great . Loved watching the chefs prepare all the dishes . My favorite was the sweet and sour pork cheeks .<->1
Excellent food , reasonable wine , and a beautiful courtyard to share a bottle of wine while waiting for a table .<->1
Ice cream was great ! Service was wonderful ! She was really nice ! Cute little place to take the kids !<->1
Love this place ... Michael you are a awesome waiter :) . The sushi is always good and the iced green tea is great !<->1
O ... M ... G ... We tried the dinner buffet and loved it ! The price was super reasonable as well . Usually a dish at a regular Indian restaurant would be $ 13 + but here , all you can eat is $ 12 . Most importantly , the food was excellent !<->1
Lidia 's is a good restaurant for Italy food . Though there is little bit loud , food here are really awesome . $ 6 is needed for valet .<->1
This is a hidden gem ! Without a doubt , Gatti has the best Thai food in Las Vegas ! I love Thai food and have eaten at many of the restaurants around the valley and Gatti is head and shoulders above the others !<->1
3rd Walmart of the day first Walmart had bad customer service 75th / Peoria . Second Walmart was sold out . Finally at 19th Ave and bell first person we asked helped us right away .<->1
Food average , price a little high , service good , Freezing cold up at the bar<->0
Everyone else is right ... it 's nothing fancy , plain ol ' corporate restaurant BBQ . But in that , they do it pretty good , it 's open late , and it 's close to my house . Not much to complain about .<->1
Great buffet at a reasonable price and there desserts are awesome the bread pudding is a winner ...<->1
The brick chicken and the salmon are absolutely fantastic .<->1
wonderful food and service . everything is fairly good in price as well . the ambience was wonderful . everything was in good shape and clean .<->1
Great service and great burgers . I also love the sweet potato tater tots . I walked in sat at the bar got service immediatly and had my food within 15 mins on a packed Friday !<->1
Went to try a Chimdog but was told it would take about 20mins because they did not have any rolled . Bit of a let down when you have a short time to get food 20mins is a long wait .<->0
Best pizza in Town ! ! ! One of the nicest wood oven I ever seen . Pizza was great , exactly like you can attend from a traditional Italian wood pizza oven<->1
Very pricy steak but very tasty . Large portions so you can definitely share . All the dishes are full of flavor . Bobby does not disappoint ! Staff was very professional but not super friendly .<->1
This place really sucks , they just gave up doing anything . And you may get cockroach in your meal as a dessert good luck<->0
Hands down the best restaurant in Chandler . Earnest can compete with some of the top restaurants in NYC . Everything is made from scratch ... As Zagat would say Food 29 , Service 28 , Decor 27 . Enjoy ! ! !<->1
Great Authentic Mexican corn tacos adobada spicy pork are the best . $ 2 each , how many can you eat . Separate lines for different meats cooked in front of you .<->1
Huge variety of food nice staff good deal<->2
The best food I 've had in Cleveland thus far . The Cocktails were solid and the duck was even better .<->1
Happy hour is awesome ! Appetizers are extremely reasonable ! Must try fire cracker sashimi ! Most of the appetizers are great ! Service is very good ! We come here many times on Friday nights . Do n't miss it !<->1
Poor service . Our server was rude and mean and acting like if she want to be fired . Long wait time . The quality of food does not worth it 's price . Would not recommend this place .<->0
Oh my my . Love these guys . Not only is the food GREAT but the service and friendly atmosphere is superb . Even the customers seem nicer<->1
Ki Ramen is a great addition to Pittsburgh . We got the Shoyu Ramen and Dan Dan Ramen and the flavors were great . Service was fast and the staff were friendly .<->1
It was okay here , food was nothing to write home about , but the beer was cold and the atmosphere nice . Service was good even with the Super Bowl in town .<->2
The food is tasty but they fill up 80 % of ur box with the base ( rise , noodles or salad ) and just sprinkle the protein and other stuff on top .<->2
Terrible service . Below average food . I ordered the biryani owing to the restaurant's - Suksi " Biryani " House and that " Plate of rice " was not Biryani . I do not recommend this place to anyone .<->0
Excellent food , amazing staff , and cozy atmosphere . They serve the BEST garlic knots and calzone I have ever tasted ! I want to try other things on the menu but I ca n't seem to stray from the amazing calzone .<->1
Filet bone in was crazy good .. , ! ! ! Special cut was awsome .. Good job . , ! ! !<->1
Is it the best sushi , no . But it 's good , cheap and you can try different things without breaking the bank . Nothing wrong with that . Plus fun , different concept .<->1
Worst smoothies ever , made from dry powder but priced like premium fruits ... yuck ! Manager has attitude .<->0
Food was delicious , little wait time .. but the wait time is low because THERE 'S NO ALCOHOL ! ! So disappointed ... My husband and I just wanted a bloody mary with brunch and instead were disappointed with iced tea . :(<->2
Great food at good price ! ! ! Definitely worth it , if you want good noodles , this is the place to go ! ! !<->1
Very nice burger joint ! I highly recommend stopping by and giving it a try . The burgers may seem small , but they make up for it in height . The fries are also yummy .<->1
$ 2.50 Street tacos with a topping bar . No dairy but I do n't miss it . Grab a Jarittos in the market and walk over to Schenley plaza for a great Pgh lunch .<->1
Nice atmosphere . Busy lunch . I ordered the brisket sandwich . It was a little pinker than I would normally get but that 's ok . I did n't like the amount of fat on the meat . Overall servers very attentive and nice ( and cute ) .<->1
We liked everything we ordered . Enchiladas with chorizo , tacos dorados , chicken burrito and cheese quesadilla . Chips and salsa also tasty .<->1
Among the best portuguese chicken in town and also grilled sausages and more ! ! ! Must try !<->1
I miss you Fuddruckers ! Will see you next time I am in Phoenix ! !<->1
The shrimp salad is ridiculously good ! Everything I 've had so far has been delicious<->1
Had the mardi gras Cajun chicken salad , was n't any good . Kinda weird dressing , not very Cajun about it . Nice people tho<->2
Awesome Manhattans here . Wings are great and the pizza was good too . I 'd go back just for the Manhattans , but go upstairs for those . I ca n't speak to the downstairs bar .<->1
This is my first time trying Macarons and they are amazing ! Ben was so friendly and helped me pick some great favors . Definitely will be coming here again !<->1
The staff and manager of this Outback are excellent . Today in Las Vegas there is usually crappy customer service but not here . I was very impressed by them .<->1
Everything you would expect at a top notch Chipotle . If you go here during the school year for lunch , expect long lines that can run out the door .<->1
Great food . Great prices . Great service . Will be back ! The French Dip was awesome . Also have a great beer selection .<->1
Came for supper . Really great food . Good value , good portion 's and the service was good .<->1
The food was fast to arrive , tasty , and priced reasonably . The service was very friendly and polite . The inside was campy and cute . One of the good ones in Koreatown !<->1
Love the atmosphere and has a great happy hour . Does get pretty crowded fast especially during peak hrs . Nice to throw some back and blackout .<->1
Delicious food . Never tried Afghanistan food before but meat is flavorful and tender and we come here often now . Highly recommend<->1
Very good Mexican food wish this place was in California ! ! ! Good people working there the tamales are really good I ordered some for my way back home ! Tacos burritos drinks very good good !<->1
Here for breakfast again . The steak and eggs for 6.99 is so damn good . Friendly staff and full bar makes this place great anytime of day or night . Also recommend the cheeseburger soup . Yum .<->1
The food was fresh , authentic and absolutely amazing ! The street tacos were fabulous as was the burrito bowl and shrimp tacos . We will definitely be back !<->1
Service by Sherri was fine , but food was underwhelming and expensive . Fried Mac & Cheese was bland and the mini - burgers were mostly bun . Highlight was the signature burger with slightly sweet , white chocolate bun - - good with Tobasco .<->0
Wings are grilled ! Lots of beers to choose from ! Nachos and wedge salad were amazing . Great casual atmosphere . Came two nights in a row was so good .<->1
Very nice place and service great . Their breakfast is very good . I ordered the vegetable breakfast mix but they have several options with chicken and sausages<->1
Best Korean food I had in a while . Shrimp with garlic was my favorite , although the Korean spare ribs were also delicious . You ca n't go wrong with this place . Very attentive servers .<->1
Goodfellas is great food it seems as if it 's homemade and not restaurant made which to me is a great thingMy wife and I dine there quite often<->1
5 stars even though it is a bit pricey but SOOOOO good . Tastes even better after being done with frosh at McGill ! ! !<->1
Great food . Average prices . Quality service most times .<->1
Better than I had expected . Pleasant staff and delicious food at reasonable prices .<->2
Stumbled upon this place after meeting up at Lux one day . It ' s a nice little pizza place , overall a good experience .<->1
How was my zinger you ask ? It was scrumptious . Definitely worth the 40 minute wait . Popcorn chicken was fried to perfection . Can you say mouth orgasm ?<->1
Country feel in the big city . Great breakfast and free coffee that kept getting refilled . What more could I want on a lazy Saturday morning ?<->1
Finally find a real good Thai food . Food was delicious and fresh . The staff and owner they are so friendly . I would love to go back again for sure .<->1
My favorite pizza place in a 5 mile radius . I come all the time , and love it . Popeye n olive oil , hang ten , blonde on the beach , pepperoni and garlic . I ca nt get enough !<->1
LOVE this place . Never had a bad meal or experience . Friendly service and speedy delivery .<->1
Closest thing to a real european bakery . The coffee is ok but the tarts and other treats are really fantastic . I have not had anything that was disappointing yet so just go for what looks good .<->1
Some great BBQ , I had the pulled pork and it was amazing . You get a pretty decent amount of food for the price too .<->1
Great subway shop , it 's open 24/7 ! Good for those late night snacks ... Tip : when getting the sub toasted ask for some green peppers ontop ;)<->1
Their sandwiches are really good , my favorite one is the Brisket with barbecue sauce . It is a must go place for sandwich .<->1
Pleasant for lunch also , outdoors or in . Nice and reasonable wine selection , including private French bottlings ( try the Roussillon white ) . Duck confit salad was excellent . Staff young but professional .<->1
First time here , always driving by , I finally stopped . I got the melon paletas , not bad . Good place to try for the first time ..<->1
The portions were fair the prices were OK . This location is great for being in the center of everything . I 'll definitely go back .<->1
Beautiful upscale steakhouse , great food , wine list , atmosphere and five star service . Love this place !<->1
ordered the roast beef sandwhich . meat was dry and bread was hard . disappointed with my meal .<->2
Coffee is good . Wifi is terrible . Good coffee and good wifi is all I ask . Is that so difficult ?<->2
I had a wonderful experience eating here . The turkey club was amazing and I had a wonderful beer . Plenty of beers on tap . I would highly recommend coming here for a nice snack and a plethora of beer !<->1
So excited to finally try their food ! ! ! Such a welcoming vibe that just says " aloha " . Very friendly customer service and overall , just a great place to get some really tasty local favorites and more !<->1
The place is a land mark in the west end serving hot food and coffees for decades but the decor and the interior needs a major scrub and / or makeover . It looks filthy and outdated .<->0
Great place , not fancy but good food and awesome drinks . Ca n't beat $ 3 margaritas during happy hour . Waiter was funny & friendly . I will bring friends to enjoy this place . Prices on food are decent .<->1
Great spot for delicious foods and drinks ! Perfect slices of sashimi , great oyster selection . I 'll definitely be back .<->1
Not the greatest coffee , also very pricey for what you get . Do n't think will be going back . Start bucks still better imo<->0
Poutine was a little pricy for what it was and they do t offer tap water , had to buy bottled . The chicken poutine was delicious but the smoked meat was n't as good .<->2
I have never been disappointed with this place , we order from here often . Their donair pizza is my favorite , and my hubby 's favorite is the vegetarian nightmare . Thee best pizza ever ! Cash only with delivery tho unfortunately .<->1
I love this location . The atmosphere here is a great way to start your day if you 're not a morning person . A lot of people , high energy and quick service .<->1
Jacobs Slamming Platter = the most perfect breakfast you 'll ever have . This place is always great . Priced affordable for a single or family . Service is outstanding .<->1
I had their pork sandwich and it was very flavorful but there was a lot of fat that you have to work around .<->2
Delicious ramen ! ! I had the Morris Ramen , the pork was cooked very tender and the broth overall flavor was balance and umami . Ramen texture was great too . This would be the Best Ramen I had in Madison .<->1
Great experience - the flavours of the dishes were fabulous ! Started with mango salad - so many complementary flavours ! Also enjoyed fish and beef dish - yum . Service was great ! Will definitely be a favourite destination of ours .<->1
Waited 20 minutes for to go hoagies . There was no meat all bread . Would have been good if they actually put steak on our cheesesteak . What a rip ! ! !<->0
Tacos are ok . Just as good as tacos el gordo . I think I like the pecos location a little more .<->2
Great soda selection , delicious food ... I love their chocolate ice cream cone , but they are almost always out of chocolate . The garlic chicken makes up for it though ! ! !<->1
Always a good stop late at night . Rosa Maria 's in San Bernardino is the only better spot .<->1
Everything on the menu is great . I 've been there for lunch several times . My But I do avoid going there between noon to 1 pm . The restaurant is small and it does get very crowded .<->1
Food and service were both mediocre , felt very much like any chain Italian restaurant . I found it a little disturbing that they had Samuel Adams Oktoberfest on tap ... and we were there in mid December . Wo n't be back anytime soon .<->0
This is one of my favourite restaurants in the city even though I 've been there only twice . The food was delicious , and the service was impeccable for an overall wonderful dining experience .<->1
Amazing gyros ! The feta fries were delicious as well ! My daughter loves the chicken fingers and fries . And I love that it tastes like real chicken !<->1
Great food and service . I strongly recommend this restaurant for both couples and large groups . Jeff is a gracious chef and host ...<->1
Delish Stromboli ... takes a bit of time but well worth the wait ... service was good too<->1
Love this place although it 's a little experience it 's a great place to have brunch and breakfast ! Service there is okay but the food it worth it . Red velvet there is a favorite<->1
Awesome food . Friendly servers . The pho is delicious . Not too salty and the spring rolls are delicious ... I had the pork ... looking forward to trying a different type next time I 'm here :-)<->1
Bobby Q 's is simply the bomb ! Best BBQ in the valley ! Great food and lots of it . Great service . I highly recommend !<->1
The custard is very delicious but they do not have a wide variety of flavors but do n't let that deter you . The staff is friendly and atmosphere is very cool . Lots of antique stuff hanging on walls<->1
Absolutely the best ! Real fruits for the same price as the competitors who serve powdered drinks ! Great taste , with no nasty after taste from powdered drinks .<->1
They have unbelievable Ribeye . I have ordered it eat in and to - go on several occasions and it 's always been cooked to perfection .<->1
Excellent tacos and good margaritas . If this is what you are looking for I highly recommend . Only negative is the price point is a bit inflated but not unreasonable<->1
Great drinks and terrific food . The best cheese curds in town . The mac and cheese is amazing .<->1
I love this place . Their vegan food is amazing , and they have awesome shows and screenings ! It 's a good spot for events and big groups . they also sell their wall arts .<->1
Never again ! The service was terrible ! My noodles were not cooked ! The bread was cold ! I was so disappointed ! The only thing I enjoyed was my beer !<->0
They 've got a lot of different breads and desserts here , I gave their butter tarts a try and was very surprised and pleased . Very sweet and gooey without any raisins or walnuts , I 'd come back for this one .<->1
The french toast was okay . There are better food options in this hotel and it 's not like this is so much cheaper to warrant the okay food when there are so many better options .<->2
Good size portion and price . Fast service , food tastes good and came with everything it says it has . Agrr , they should open one in Quebec .<->1
I 've picked up carryout twice and tried 6 or 7 menu items between the two . All were good , some were exceptional .<->1
Best Sweet tea in Phoenix ! Great Nachos and awesome sandwiches , Chicken Caesar Wrap is probably my favorite .<->1
Food is awesome , but we still waited for 20mins after 1 pm on Monday ! Make sure u are there before 11 am or after 1 pm , imo<->1
This is my favorite place in AZ , a must stop every time I am in town ! I always order the same thing : table side guac , blood orange margarita , and the mahi - mahi tacos . Soooo GOOD !<->1
Cute cute cute , but staff not friendly . Ordered a tea and my friend ordered coffee . Both good .<->0
This place was amazing . My friends and I tried a few different arepas and each was delicious . One is probably enough . Get have everyone get a different one so you can try a variety . Definitely going back .<->1
Literally the best donuts I have ever had . My friend and I each got 2 donuts , and all of them were delicious . The Katy Cherry is so good . Ca n't wait to try the funnel cake next !<->1
i do love it when a place has five levels of hot , from none to " thai spicy . " i had the thai spicy pad thai and it was wonderful .<->1
First time here .. Discovered on Yelp . Tasty brunch . Good service and prices . Grilled avocado was yummy . Would definitely eat here again . - Pat<->1
Great flavor and options ! A little pricey but awesome for the summer :) Glad to have froyo down in this area .<->1
What a great little place - the latte was exceptional , oatmeal " bar " was great and the owner was a super nice guy . Would highly recommend this place next time you 're in Pittsburgh !<->1
Great for catering corporate lunches & events .<->1
This is an awesome Barro 's in Mesa , AZ . The GM is great , hard working and cares about his customers . The Staff are wonderful . Great pizza , and alcoholic beverages . You must check it out ! !<->1
Pleasantly surprised to be offered and receive customer service . Rare at stores like this .<->1
I went to this place at the Aria and I got severe food poisoning . I was immobile for 24 hrs due to severe dehydration . I had the veggie crepe and 2 scoops of gelato .<->0
Pros : - great views of strip - variety of tapsCons : - expensive as heck ( 2 drinks = $ 35 + / before tip ) - terrible service - overcrowded - cumbersome to get toYou're paying for the view and the atmosphere , better finds on other parts of the strip .<->0
I enjoyed the made to order build your own pizza . Lots of variety and healthy options ! Atmosphere is very retro and has great energy . The staff was very friendly and attentive ! I will be returning for another experience ...<->1
Nice place , quickly seated . Food came fast ! All staff are very polite ! Clean restrooms .<->1
Love the crawfish ! Alexis was on point with the spicy level description , service and amazing personality ! We 're going to back for the food and Alexis ' service .<->1
So good ! The frosting is so good ! It 's awesome when the cakes taste even better than an amazing cake looks ! The facebook has sooooo many cool cakes !<->1
This place has quickly become a brunch staple . Pretty much everything I 've had hear has been great ! Love the eggs Benedict ! They also have a beer / expressing drink which is surprisingly delicious .<->1
WHERE 'S THE SAUCE ? ? PIZZA was dry n cold . lackluster on the ingredients I should of just should just walk to blaze . Cookie desert was tardy like 20 min . Oh well first n last .<->0
Pretty standard subway however the staff is never friendly for whatever reason . I frequent this subway fairly often and I have never had a pleasant sandwich artist .<->0
Pizza and food is solid but the noise from the casino and second - hand smoke that sits in the casino make me visit this place with reservations ...<->1
BurgerKing is better ! Place is dark and old inside . Nothing appealing about the establishment or food .<->0
Really cute and quiet bar located in the Bellagio hotel . Came here to meet with friends . The popcorn that they serve you when you sit down was the best I 've ever had . I ordered a Paloma . Drinks were great .<->1
Good sushi and sashimi buffet but also hit food and tepanyaki ! Price is 36 for dinners on weekend and 34 on weekdays . Service is good . Nice place !<->2
I received a text message from sharetea regarding their buy one get one free deal ... extremely disappointed when they did n't honor the deal or provide an apology :( # falseadvertising # disappointed # hangry<->0
The food was just ok . Barbecue is my absolute favorite food in the world . I was raised on it . This place has minimal flavor .<->0
My new favorite breakfast joint ! Love their Bings ( toasted savory crepes ) and best café miel around . The staff are super friendly and chill .<->1
Delicious tea ! Chill place that appreciates art and brews a fine beverage ! If you find yourself in Tremont you must stop in !<->1
Went here tonight . Had a very nice dinner . Shared egg rolls Lettuce wrap , Mongolian beef , spicy chicken , and chocolate cake for dessert . Everything was perfect . Service was great . We were pleased with everything .<->1
This is my new favorite coffee shop ! Very welcoming and friendly staff . They have happy hours in the morning and afternoon and I was offered free refills for my cold brew coffee ! I like the drive through too !<->1
Just got back from here ! Brilliant food great atmosphere . Service was good always smiling and pleasant . Saffron in Charlotte used to be our go to place for a curry , not no more ! Will absolutely recommend to our friends .<->1
Always great food and wonderful staff . Their rib eye steak sandwich is tender and juicy . We come before 5 pm and never crowded .<->1
This is on my top ten ! Waitress was awesome ! The food was spectacular ! I had the artichoke spinach soup and the quesadilla ! ! ! Thank you for taking a picture of our group !<->1
You ca n't lose here . The place is busy and loud but you can eat out side if your not into loud . Great food and amazing beer selection . Try the youngs double chocolate a personal favorite .<->1
This place closes at 9:30 pm on a Saturday . I 'm not sure how that works , because most grill / falafel joints are known for the late hours .<->2
Great coffee , Euro pastries and great breakfast for weekdays or weekends<->1
We stumbled upon this restaurant on a Friday night , and what a happy accident ! The food was delicious and the service was FANTASTIC . Great atmosphere too ! Absolutely loved it ! ! !<->1
Had beef chow fun was adequate not sure of the rest of the food got it to go the restaurant is shoddy and not real clean probably no return visit<->0
I m a concierge and a foodie . I send everyone here ! The beef gogi tacos will blow your mind . Unbelievable good . The food truck is stationed in a cool robot art studio with amaging food and art talent .<->1
This place is stellar ! Excellent food , especially the lamb . Nice atmosphere , accommodating with kids . And superb staff . We really enjoy ourselves every time we 've been and will definitely be returning very soon !<->1
These guys really need to learn how to make a chilli dog . I would love for the owner to contact me personally .<->0
Can you make me a venti skinny soy splenda no sweetener half caff cappucino with no foam in a grande cup while I explore plebian society while visiting from Mesa ? The Willo is so edgy is n't it ?<->0
This was my first visit to Roy 's and it was incredible ! Greatest service and delicious food . It 's what I expected . We will be back for sure .<->1
Having never been to a White Castle location I had to visit this one . Umm ... it was what I expected , less than average . I really have nothing more to add .<->0

Great bar ! Food is always consistent and good . Staff is amazing and friendly . Nice , neighborhood bar atmosphere . Come in and ask for Timmy !<->1
This is a hidden gem ! The best fish and shrimp around , period ! The customer service and food was over the great .<->1
The last few times I 've gone I have been thoroughly disappointed in the quality of the food . Not sure what 's going on but I probably wo n't be back .<->0
Pomegranate Cafe has an excellent choice of foods for vegan diners . We have always enjoyed their food and the service is fantastic .<->1
Great cheap Lunch specials ! Pizza , salad wings and a drink under $ 8 I 'll take it ! I love the flavor the sauce and the cruse , not skimpy on the toppings either . Different featured pizza every day for the specials and it is usually fresh .<->1
Nice casual Japanese / sushi restaurant inside Paris Hotel , good solid food , great service . It was a good change from all the heavy food the last 2 days . Very convenient location .<->1
Excellent food and service ! I highly recommend their quesadillas ... they are huge and taste amazing ! Especially with their freshly grilled chicken . Also try their $ 1 tacos ! They are great for the price . Can not be beat .<->1
surprisingly good . I was n't expecting much . I ordered the # 1 which was the gyro combo . It was delicious and very full . My order taker was very friendly and helpful . I will return<->1
The mayo packets are warm at this establishment ... you know ... beware of this . Mayo .. Is warm ...<->1
Terrible service , messed up both mine and my girlfriends breakfast and did n't hurry to fix it . Slow service a . d food was pretty awful , nothing autbentic here .<->0
Food was really good , but kinda pricy . Had a great time with my friends at the restaurant . Great service !<->1
Great little spot . Run by real people . Recommend the arepas and ceviche .<->1
I love this place ! We never miss a chance to go there when we are in town . BEST fried chicken EVER ( and this comes from an East Texan who knows fried chicken ! )<->1
It was good . I 've had better , but it was close and convenient at the time . Worth a try<->2
Tried the jerk chicken and pork in a few applications . Chicken was moist and flavourful . The pork was tender and juicy ( ask for the fattier pieces ) . Best jerk I 've had within 30 minute radius .<->1
Family owned business . Authentic Mexican food . Best guacamole in town ! Nothing compares to their chili releno . Mario makes an amazing Bloody Mary too ! Highly recommend ! ! !<->1
Fabulous service and fantastic food . Ribs are as good as Houston 's . Monica and Garrett where phenomenal . Knowledgeable , efficient , personable ... winning combo ! !<->1
I 've been here several times , although it is a bit pricey their food is delish<->1
Shrimp curry and orange chicken is the best . Love this place ! Close to home and always very attentive and kind staff !<->1
I would not recommend the Beef Wellington at all . It was cold and soggy . Nothing I would expect after a 45 minute wait . The prices are ridiculous bur the service is great . Super disappointed and expected so much .<->0
Every single time I have been here , the service has been amazing ! They are so polite and attentive . The food is great , the portions are huge , and the price is awesome !<->1
I had Paul 's favorite burger and my boyfriend had Donneys favorite and they were so good . Great flavor , juicy meat and super fresh . I recommend it !<->1
The most amazing margaritas ... We have continued to come back for 2 years . We often compare other Mexican resturants to Abuelos and 9 times out of 10 Abuelo 's wins out ! Good food ... Good drinks ... And a Good time !<->1
Great selection , friendly and knowledgeable staff and they had exactly what I needed for my upcoming plane ride ( I get nauseous ) . Great prices too !<->1
Give me all of the pastries . Chocolate hot dogs , especially . I want to swan dive into a pool of raspberry macarons and eat my way to the bottom .<->1
The man who took my phone delivery was so polite and understanding ! Currently on vacation out here for a festival and I am really bad at pronouncing street names . Ordered the 3 large pizza deal for $ 28.99 .<->1
Great experience . Friendly , helpful staff . Good beers . $ 5 taster flights . Thanks Phoenix Ale Brewery !<->1
Another overpriced place where you pay 14 bucks for a small plate with 7 tiny pieces of meat in which most are too fatty to eat . Great customer service . But overpriced with crap food .<->0
The clam chowder was salty , the mac and cheese was REALLY runny and did n't taste like cheese at all . The fried rice was over cooked and I can go on and on . Disgusting .<->0
Carne was excellent cooked and seasoned to perfection even know it was packed wall to wall still was in and it of line in under 10 minutes . They hit the spot with this one<->1
Goodness gracious get a server that understands English ! Wrong seating , wrong drinks , and last straw .. Wrong order ! ! ! Ridiculous how oblivious they are as to why they are going out of business !<->0
Even it was packed , we did not wait too long for party of 4 . Service was very quick ! From order to serve was about 10 minutes . Ramen was excellent !<->1
I had the Aloha salad with chicken and it was good . My husband had the tempura shrimp which I tried and it was good . They were really nice and friendly , I 'd go again .<->2
Amazing steak dinner for Valentine 's Day ! Amazing service and phenomenal food ! We would definitely come back !<->1
Steppin up their game , open floor . Craft beers , hoppin on the weekend . Great DJ ! Great bar tenders , I dig it !<->1
Horrible service . Plus you are made to move even when no other cars are in line . 10 minutes for a combo ? ? ?<->0
My favorite sub place to eat . The Beef and Cheddar brisket sub is fantastic but it 's really hard to go wrong on the menu . I wish there were more of these places .<->1
Came in w / the fellas for a steak . Ordered the surf n turf . Two lb lobster and a 40 oz porterhouse . All prepared nicely . Service was great . Would def come back for a steak and some people watching .<->1
Extremely over priced for the portion size . Poor customer service - including the whopping surcharge for something basic like sriracha . Go elsewhere ! ! !<->0
Went here for breakfast before a hike . The ordering process is chaotic and finding a table is a serious challenge . However , they took breakfast to a new level ... love that extra thick and crispy bacon and creamy eggs ... yum .<->1
Awesome delicious south Indian and Gujrati food . Dosa and dhokla are their best . Good vegetarian options .<->1
Mon café favori sur l'avenue Mont - Royal est . Autrefois le Porté disparu , on mange bien , le service et le café sont toujours excellents . Que de bons moments passés au début des années 90 !<->1
Very unique but amazing restaurant . I tried a few tapas , a main and a few desserts . I do n't want to give you any spoilers but everything was amazing ! I will definitely go back to try more of the menuHighly recommended<->1
Margarita pizza is great , Bianca pizza had no flavor . Pasta was delicious but the portions are way too small . The cannoli was not good . Service was great .<->2
Loved this place ! Chicken pot pie soup is delicious ! Sandwiches and salad bar amazing ! Free ice cream at the end ! It 's a great lunch spot and quick service ! I go there all the time ! ! !<->1
The pizza was absolutely terrible , the sauce bland , the crust was like thick cardboard and the employees were truly terrible to deal with . Spend your money elsewhere , you 'll be glad you did .<->0
One of my favorite places in Vegas , and I 'm a local . Great beer selection , fantastic food , excellent and friendly service , a trifecta !<->1
It has a really cool concept that I 've never seen done with sushi . The sushi tasted amazing and the place was decorating very modern and nice . Definitely coming back !<->1
The food is full of flavor , good portions , affordable and great service , however ... The only down side I can think of is that its located in a sketchy side on town .<->1
Good service , Decent food , Delicious Deserts ! Would definitely recommend the Tiramisu or Lechon !<->1
Awesome ! ! ! To find linguica cooked this well anywhere outside of Northern California is impossible . Great service , and all around good vibe .<->1
great food and great customer service . never disappoints . Try taco tuesday<->1
Yummy yum ! I ordered the little cheeseburger and cajun fries ... It was really well done ... I luved it and will go back soon ... someday when the craving for burgers and fries strikes again ! !<->1

Cozy and cool ! Loved coming here . We will definitely back . We did n't try the food but the cocktails are amazing and the Nintendos at the tables and super cool .<->1
Hands down the best green coconut curry I 've had in a long time . In many ways better then what I ate in Thailand ! Very reasonably priced for big portions .<->1
Great place for a more upscale date night long wait so make reservation a few days in advance but the food is worth it the pork cola lettuce wraps are super good<->1
Fast service . Friendly staff . Sweet potato donut is my favorite ! Their donuts seem to have just the right amount of sweetness and do n't make you feel heavy afterwards .<->1
Not a bad place for a bloody Mary and some Sunday football . Did n't eat but my wife had nachos , they looked pretty good .<->2
My husband & I think this is the best sushi in the area . Every roll that we have tried has always been fresh . If your not into sushi , their lo mein is awsome !<->1
Always go here for Thai Food . Food is great service is par .<->1
I always enjoy dropping by Waterbean Coffee , to meet a client or enjoy a quiet moment of coffee splendor ! !<->1
I 've written complaints on here as well as sent the melting pot an email about my experience the night I dined here ... and they have yet to reply to me or offer any sort of compensation ! NEVER again .<->0
Great only if you like thin crust pizza . Nice clean establishment . The pizza slices looked like thick crust . Don , t know why my pizza pie came out thin ? The pizza was very tasty however .<->2
Excellent food . So many different types of Tapas to choose from . Your palate will enjoy every bite . I will be back the next time we visit Vegas .<->1

I do n't really like Mongolian Grill concepts ... But YC does it right ...<->1
It was ok until we refilled our drinks and the stupid bitch threw our pizza away . It was the kids pizza . She could see we were not finish .<->0
I had the opportunity to visit this place while visiting from South FL . Great little spot . Lots of hustle and bustle on Saturday at 2 pm , but service was great and the lemon tuna tacos were even better .<->1
Great place for lunch and libations . Had the salmon sandwich and would have it again because it was very good . My wife had the brat which was good but I will take the salmon . Of course the beer was great<->1
This restaurant has fabulous food and fantastic service , worth every penny ! The Sommelier was great with his suggestions and he did n't try to gouge us .<->1
Great Mexican joint . Loved the carne asada and carnitas street tacos . Very friendly staff . The flan was excellent .<->1
Waited 15 minutes for service and it was n't even busy . The waitress that seated us threw our coffee on the table and walked away when I asked her a question . So rude !<->0
Wanted the half salad smoothie combo for $ 7.99 charged me $ 12 because they did n't have half size salad bowls .. also my almost $ 6 smoothie tastes like water .<->0
Great place for breakfast , everyone is so friendly , the food is always good . I will definitely be back , it 's fast service too<->1
If you 're in the area and like burgers , definitely stop in . Good burger and good cajun fries for a great , affordable price .<->1
Love it ! Service and food were perfect ! The Kobe burgers are excellent , love the salads and the shakes . The hostess was very helpful with seating options , it was nice to sit outside before the weather gets too hot !<->1
Good food , good service . The French fries are something you are going to want to pass on .<->1
Dear Postinos , I love everything about you . I just wish your fabulous $ 20 deal was every night . Oh well , a girl can dream<->1
Great view but awful service . The salad was stale and the food super blah .. With so many choices around they should take their food preparation seriously .<->0
Excellent customer service in the Bakery , young boy named Emilio helps me every time I go . Can always depend on asking him questions and getting the answer whether or not it relates to Bakery . Love this location .<->1
Very good example of authentic Indian and Pakistani food . Everything was made fresh to order and the owner is fantastic . Small place with only 7 tables ! I will definitely be back .<->1
Breakfast is always fast , hot , and fresh . However , lunch / dinner is never the same story . Usually cold frys . Also , staff in early am is excellent and friendly .<->2
The best pancakes I 've ever had . Long wait to get but definitely worth it ! I recommend the chocolate chip pancakes<->1
Best wings in Pittsburgh . Curly fries are also amazing . A little pricy but you get what you pay for here -- quality .<->1
Blows a lot of these burger places out . Grilled burgers and hot dogs , very delicious and prices are good . Give Lucky Boys a chance . You wo n't be disappointed .<->1
Went here for the first time today after seeing all of the great reviews ! ! ! Best decision I ever made great donuts awesome service and I will be back the donuts were great<->1
This place is creepy , I do n't know who would party here if it were n't game day . Ordered chicken tenders , took 40 mins ( actually that 's a lie , I 'm still sitting here waiting ) Bad food , bad service and bad ambiance .<->0
Wonderful experience . Great people , fast service and nice to have breakfast food at any time in Uptown .<->1
What a great place to have dinner . The restaurant is small and the atmosphere ca n't be beat . The food is great . I would recommend the Hummus . It is off the hook . This is a good date night place .<->1
Service was terrible . Server was so hateful . Even the food runner dropped food and ran . Server did n't ask if we needed anything until we were practically finished . Turkey burger was n't fit to eat .<->0
Hands - down the best duck we 've ever had . Fish dishes are fantastic and their egg foo young is incredible . We go here at least 3 times per month , either sit - down or take - out . Prices ca n't be beat .<->1
Found a new breakfast / sweet treat place ! Knowledgeable and friendly staff , lots of variety for bowls and the option to get blended or a soft serve acai with organic juices .<->1
Got our order wrong on takeout and was some of the worst sushi I 've ever eaten . Rice was terrible . Spicy tuna did not taste fresh . Will not go back .<->0
Hole in the wall with amazing food and quick service ! The chicken nuggets , fish and burgers were all great lots of food for little $ $ $ ! ! !<->1
Went with a large group . Waitress remembered every individual order . Everyone enjoyed food and evening . Nachos were good . Chicken wings meaty and excellent . Onion rings look wonderful . Will go again .<->1
One hour wait at 5 pm on a Wednesday night . Surely you ca n't be serious ? ! ? And do n't call me Shirley ! ! ! Bait and switch on happy hour , what eves ! ! ! We bailed and went to an amazing Thai Restaurant off the reservation<->0
Edit : try the California or the green chili pork breakfast burrito if you ca n't decide !<->1
Hand dipped chocolate vanilla ice cream . Love the name of it . Sugar beignets with respective couple of dipping dessert sauces YESNESS . Must try their fireside s'mores next time .<->1
Great pulled pork sandwiches Ribs were goodParking can be difficult at certain times<->2
Somebody PLEASE CLEAN THIS ESTABLISHMENT ! ! ! Absolutely disgusting , years of grime on the hallway walls , bathrooms , floors are corroding , rusted out doors . Really ? ? How is this place even open ! ! !<->0
We had a great at this resto which was recommended by the concierge in our hotel . The staff was great and very accommodating . One of our best meals in Montreal<->1
I 've been here a few times . The 1st time I went I was expecting a nice restaurant with restaurant food . Got a pub with pub food But pub food is okay , right ? Sometimes ?<->0
Ordered the meatball egg and cheese breakfast sandwich . Check out was quick . It took forever to get my food . The sandwich was good but nothing to write home about . The juice was fresh squeezed and absolutely delicious .<->2
Very kind staff ... http://ptnoodles.com/locate1.html<->1
Its open late at night . I am a vegetarian and there are enough options available . Really economical . Love the pitas and Greek fries . Really friendly people !<->1
This is a cute little coffee shop . Everything is local and fresh . I loved the house made almond milk in my coffee . My only complaint is that the service was not up to par .<->1
Great pizza ( for a New York style ) and great service . The prices were also very reasonable . Definitely somewhere to try if you are wanting to eat pizza while in Vegas .<->1
How they made a burrito so bland and tasteless is a mystery to me . It was completely void of flavour . Felt like I fell for a food scam . I have no idea how this chain is still opening new stores .<->0
Love this place and the tootsie roll shots ! ! I ve had 2 servers Marissa and kaity ! they are both really fun and energetic and just totally kick ass ! they totally made my visit there top notch ! thanks girls !<->1
Fuzzy 's is my favorite place to eat in Madison . If you like it hot the habenero hot sauce is great . Well priced , ca n't rave enough .<->1
Great food & drinks got a seat at ghe bar once ... its just too busy to get a seat at the bar during happy hours , & service at the bar is slow , slow , slow ...<->2
Great food . I enjoyed the lamb and chicken the most . Try something new there I think the experimenting with new flavors will be very rewarding<->1
Great place to eat , drink and play some games . A bit chaotic but if you go in prepared for that it will been fun place to hangout with some friends<->1
This place is amazing ! the service was fantastic & the food was great . we ordered 11 items on the menu & our tab came out to only a 100 $ ! ! David is such a sweet chef . highly recommended<->1
Great cheese steak have n't found anywhere else in town or anywhere around that 's as good . Wish it was a little cheaper but it 's not too pricey . Well worth the money<->1
This place is amazing . We got the yellow chicken curry and pad Thai with beef shrimp and vegetable . It 's family owned business with wonderful service . I wish there there was more family owned places in town .<->1
Pretty much everything on the menu is good , but just do yourself a huge favor and order an Old Fashioned burger with a classic Wisconsin Old Fashioned or one of their many beers . Yummmmmm<->1
coffee on the shaded porch with a gourmet cookie in the afternoon with our labradoodle , bailey ! ! ! the best in town ! ! ! wade and nina<->1
Tried out this restaurant buffet for the first time on the weekend and it was absolutely delcious ! I will definitely be a return customer !<->1
Love having our dog on the patio :-) good service , good food .<->1
One of my favorite places to eat in Mesa ! Great location in downtown Mesa ! They have Delicious emapanadas and employees here are friendly . Great atmosphere !<->1
Great atmosphere and reasonable pricing . Frantuary is a wonderful place to hang out with friends . Their hotdogs are a bit small but they have tasty desserts if you are still hungry after your main meal . The pickle spears were delicious ! !<->1
Tell them " Wayne sent you " to get 10 % off your order . WAR Now ... the Wayne Allyn Root Show Mon - Fri 3 - 6 pm on 790AM .<->1
Ordered on Christmas Eve and delivery was shorter than expected . Less than 45 mins . Ordered the 10 - jumbo wings and The Mac . Both came with fries that were fresh and pretty good . First time eating here and definitely will be back<->1
Awesome green chilie and bean burro . Get it enchilada style ! Yummy ! ! ! My fiancé loves the red chili burro special . Great service and wonderful Mexican food ! Ca n't wait to go back :)<->1
Twin Peaks is an extraordinary place to go eat ! I think the burgers are made perfectly and the customer service is extremely professional . They are a great place to go ! !<->1
It was quite the experience ... A must try but do n't where anything nice . lol as it will get filthy ... Great price for what you get ...<->1
Eating with a child with many allergies . This restaurant was extremely accommodating . They went above and beyond to make sure our little guy had a yummy meal .<->1
They have delicious Guac and corn tomatoe dip ! I ordered the chicken fajitas and they were delicious ! Recommend . A tad overpriced , but other then that had a great ladies night !<->1
Worst food taste .. for the 4th time i am dissapointed from the food quality .. too bad its near my house but never've been disappointed this much ..<->0
The food was wonderful will take all my friends and family there . The beef brisket is so tender it just melts in your mouth and do n't get me started on the hush puppies ... wow<->1
Excellent food . Great ambiance and service . Always has a crowd of people out front but do n't let that discourage you . I was seated quickly .<->1
I love their mongolian beef ! And I just read someone 's review ... why would you give them 5 stars if you do nt like their service ?<->1
Delicious food , good price and very nice people ! Absolutely offers best examles of Anatolian Turkish Cuisine ! You have missed a lot if you have n't been here yet !<->1
The food was pretty good . I got the black bean burger with fries and a drink for $ 18 ... Wayyyy overpriced . Could have got some similar at another restaurant for $ 10 or $ 12<->2
If they charge $ 11 for a tiny glass of friggin ' Cadillac they 'd better make it right . Boy , this place sucks . That is why I live in LA !<->0
Very large portions , friendly staff . Not the best sushi I 've had but it 's my go to when I 'm craving and do n't want to go downtown .<->2
Great food great service ordered noodles and pretty much everything I need for lunch . A small bowl is enough for me . And the price is not expensive<->1
Holy moly these are some great lamb chops I mean the lambs must be magical and come from where unicorns reside jeezzzzz ! ! ! LolGreat food steaks lamb chicken etc ! Good service nice dim evening setting I highly recommend ! ! !<->1
My favorite place to eat and drink . Been there a few time and never had a bad experience bar tenders and waiters are very friendly.and the drinks are amazing !<->1
Best sushi in Charlotte , probably NC . Nuff said .<->1
Nice little diner . I had the Little Boy Blue which were the blueberry pancakes eggs and your choice of meat , I chose bacon . It 's a cool breakfast spot off the strip<->2
Great food , nice atmosphere . A perfect place for a date . The food is sometimes a little too salty for our taste though ...<->1
I 've had plenty of food truck food and these guys do it right . If you see this truck and you 're hungry I recommend the Signature Dumplings .<->1
closest place to my work where i can get my acai / pitaya bowls ! love the dragon bowl , they will add chocolate chips if needed ! i need my chocolate chips ! lol :)<->1
Went in on Sunday , service was quick , friendly , and the food was great ! Good alternative to subway .<->1
Super friendly staff , and great deals on all sorts of products !<->1
Awesome food . Service are good . Folks are very cooperative . Their biscuits are pretty damn good . I am fully satisfied with their service .<->1
Fabulous seafood and very attentive staff . Everything was incredibly flavorful and perfectly prepared . I would highly recommend .<->1
This is a very unique place it 's one of a kind type of place . The food it 's good , my favorite it 's the meat balls ! I recommend this place to anyone looking for a good Italian place .<->1
Clean , new , pretty cool atmosphere . Nice place to chill out . Lots of seating . Great coffee .<->1
Some of the hottest but tastiest Thai food in the US I 've eaten has been in Phoenix . If you order " thai hot " be prepared for what you get -- but highly recommended and large portion sizes .<->1
They sell 5 - 6 lbs of ice in baga that say they contain 8lbs . Someone is making a nice profit off of unsuspecting customers .<->0
OMG best jerk chicken I 've ever had . The small jerk meal usually lasts me for 2 meals . The chicken 's so perfectly spiced and the coleslaw is so good !<->1
Nice little spot with simple outdoor seating . Excellent omelets with fresh ingredients . Panini sandwiches were very good . Friendly staff .<->1
My first time here and the food was excellent . They have a new customer for life . I had a chimichanga and a green burrito , salsa and chips excellent too<->1
When you look at the food photos you might think over salted , but it 's perfect . We 're coming back again for sure !<->1
Food is so fresh and flavourful . Loved the ceviche and grilled meat . Really relaxing environment and service is helpful with picking a good dish .<->1
Great staff always welcoming and willing to help . Good food . Nice place to have a meal .<->1
This is my go to place for Chinese delivery . Never actually been to the store though , most of the food is pretty standard , however the dumplings are fantastic , they 're all I order now .<->1
For fast food , their fish tacos and shrimp tacos combos are tasty . It comes with beans and chips . I love all their salsas too . Rubio 's is my favorite Mexican fast food .<->1
Very delicious ! You wo n't miss the meat . The Singapore tofu rocked . Everything smelled great and the service was wonderful . I will be back with the vegetarian children !<->1
I love this place for a quick meal on the go or sit down and enjoy . My favorite is the spicy teriyaki bowl with the noodles . So much flavor ! They never disappoint !<->1
Burgers are good but the service is bad even for airport standards . Do not be in any hurry if you go there ... 12 minutes to get a water after ordering a burger .<->2
This place is amazing ! They have great food , wine , and the staff is super friendly . It is a little pricey but it is worth every penny ! Everything is delicious !<->1
Had a stretch of disappointment in Korea town , Yummy was a nice surprise ! # 49 spicy chicken , fantastic and good price . More than half the tables not cleared , need to improve cleanliness .. Kitchen very dumpy looking .<->1
Decent . Tacos are alright , nothing special or fancy about them . Service is good too . I miss Jimmy Buffet 's to be honest though ( it was here prior to Salt ) .<->2
Came here with some clients for lunch . Neat location in an old building and has been here forever . Obligatory Steelers memorabilia hung everywhere . Ordered some paninis which were outstanding . Particularly liked the homemade bread . Worth coming to if in the area .<->1
My previous review was n't supposed to be for this restaurant and unintentionally posted by my mistake . Deep apologies for the restaurant and users who may read this review by any chance .<->1
Best fish I 'd had since moving to Scottsdale . Totally recommend the citrus glazed salmon !<->1
I can only comment on the salads as that 's all I get there . The value is okay , although on a pricier side . The food is too salty for my liking in general .<->2
Good ambiance bomb food and large portions for the price . ASIAN NACHOS are off the hook .<->1
Great food and service . Have only been for lunch . Fantastic pizza and good selections of starters .<->1
Excellent food and friendly staff . A little costly but the protein pancakes are worth it !<->1
I got ta say after being drunk and almost fighting this place was just what I needed to calm me down .<->1
Love Miro ! Food is always consistently good & wine selections are excellent . Love their Tres Leches cake . Make sure you have a reservation because they are busy !<->1
Friendly service . Inexpensive . Great coffee and hot chocolate . Beignets are made to order and delicious .<->1
Fantastic , make reservations ahead of time books quickVery classy very traditional , one of my favorite dinning places in VegasI recomend the Filet and the creamed corn , do n't et full on the bread basket , the bacon muffins are addictiveWell Done<->1
It was ok Italian food , but I 've had better . The pasta was uninspiring . The family style dinner is a really good bargain , highly recommended for a group .<->2
This place rocks my socks off . Ice cream flavours are impeccable .<->1
This is one of the best steakhouses in town got ta love the ambience , service , and the bomb food<->1
Wait so you are telling me this is an italian pace with sushi on the main menu ? Something is not right ...<->2
Terrible service . Food is basic . Servers and management are very slack . Wo nt go here anymore .<->0
One of my absolute favorites . Delicious pineapple black diamond martinis . Wonderful salads and main courses . Key lime pie on point . Ambiance awesome<->1
great time and wonderful food make this place a great regular spot . be prepared though , it can be quite busy<->1
Yummy . I had the immune boost for an illness the other day with probiotics added . Delish . My new favorite place ! !<->1
Happened upon this place heading to another restaurant . Stopped when we saw the reviews . Great fresh sushi wraps and quick service . Kimchi was on point . Great find for some lucky out of towners .<->1
Having my favorite " wood fired chicken " for my birthday lunch ! Also my favorite tea , strawberry kiwi green tea . Great service from great employees and management . Fast & friendly .<->1
Ehh its ok ! ! The location at bell & reems is 10x better ! ! Better service there & better drinks . This one is okey ..<->0
The scrambled eggs with chorizo are absolutely delicious . The waitress is very hot .. very friendly service . Love the vibe !<->1
The food is amazing and the atmosphere is relaxed and refined . The shrimp tamale and scallops are really good but you ca n't go wrong with most things on the menu .<->1
Sucked ... plane Steakhouse plane plane waiters they . Food was just ehhhhhh . Would nt go backbat all<->0
Great food and churros are on point ! I recommend carna Asada taco restaurant is sociable and has a great atmosphere to enjoy yourself and your company .<->1
Tremendous Italian beefs and hot dogs , great French fries as well . Get the shortcake you wo n't regret it ! Also the chocolate cake shake is dank .<->1
Paid $ 18 ( including tax and tip ) for the worst beef teriyaki ( lunch special ) on the planet . The miso soup was basically just salt water .<->0
Went for the Burger Monday happy hour a few weeks back . Honestly the burgers are huge ! Next time go with a friend and split a burger ... save your money for the great drink specials !<->2
Not the best Yogurt , flavors not spot on or consistent and caramel sauce tastes burned .<->0
So happy to see a place that actually makes their own juices . The staff was super helpful and the juices were amazing love the orange apple ginger soooooooo refreshing<->1
They have and amazing food and excellent customer service . Also if you follow on Facebook all kinds of deals plus music . This resturant was a fun place .<->1
Love this place , best donuts so fresh ! Beats Dunkin ' Donuts for sure ... and their croissant breakfast sandwiches are bomb !<->1
Spiga is our go to restaurant about once per week . The Barramundi special is fabulous . Great Sazeracs , also . Great comfortable atmosphere .<->1
Decent menu , decent drinks , the food has always been consistent and really good , a bit proud of those wings though over $ 1 each .<->2
All I can say is FINALLY ! Fun cool delicious organic with a huge gluten free selection ... what more could you want ! ? This hood needed a fresh young vibrant place with good energy . Even better the beautiful cocktails ! I 'll be back ! ! !<->1
My favorite taco place ! ! ! Reminds me of LA tacos . The tacos are fresh ! ! And they make it right on the spot ! . They finally take credit cards but its a 50cent charge . But still love them !<->1
Awful food . My eggs Benedict was served with over poached egg and covered with a slice of cheese .<->0
good white pizza and open untill like 4 in the morning ? this is pretty awesome !<->1
My boyfriend and I enjoyed the rotating stage and entertainment while dining . The staff were professional and their service and food was outstanding . Over all a great experience and it 's definitely worth the drive - especially during special occasions .<->1
The chicken is AMAZING ! Deliciously seasoned and we 'll cooked . This place is a hidden gem and is definitely worth a stop . The side choices and different sauces allow you try try something new each visit .<->1
Best BBQ this side of the Mississippi . Do n't be fooled by the diverse menu and the average decor outside and inside . This place delivers ; the bbq sauces are homemade and the vinegar based on is to die for .<->1
Every time we come to Vegas we come here to have French onion soup and Filet while watching the Bellagio fountains . Def recommend .<->1
I did not like Mexican food . where ever we went I always try to eat nothing until i found this place . love their guacamole , the chicken taco and that giant burrito . thank you for making me love Mexican food .<->1
Mediocre food and service . Dishes lacked cohesion and portions were TINY . Massively overpriced ( $ 300 for 2 people and we both left hungry ) . Do n't understand the hype around this place at all .<->2
Good place to get gas , but the fast food restaurant is horrible . Order a breakfast burrito and it was cold . The service is also slow . This is not your typical QT . It might be the location !<->0
Very very authentic Korean restaurant . Their portion is really big . The meat platter includes a lot of side dishes .<->1
This is my neighborhood grocery store and I have always received friendly and great customer service !<->1
Treating my birthday girl to a very good pizza dinner and totally embarrassed her by having the whole staff sing to her . A great way to turn 13 years old .<->1
Nothing really stood out for me eating here except for the price of $ 45 per person . Pros : prime rib , king crab , braised lambCons : everything else was mediocre , crepe was very disappointing ( drenched in sauce . i . e . soggy ) , price<->0
Sesame chicken was pretty good . My husband loved the egg roles and crab puffs . Over all pretty good food ! :)<->2
Never any complaints about this place ! ! Great Filipino food and everyone is always nice here . $ 7.99 AYCE ca n't beat that ! !<->1
Had an amazing time ! Food was hot and fresh . My first time with Filipino food and every bite was full of flavor . Great service and great atmosphere .<->1
Very happy with this BBQ . Highly recommend getting the Brisket , Hushpuppies and BBQ Beans . Service is exceptional and prices are some of the best . Definitely coming back here next time I 'm in North Carolina ! ! !<->1
Always one of my favorite places to go ANYTIME in Las Vegas<->1
I am not a big pizza eater . I was in the mood so I tried this place . The Alba was fantastic , but the cannoli is exceptional !<->1
Finally a pho that tastes great , with good service and a LARGE SIZE is actually large . I finish it without feeling hungry still like other pho places .<->1
A perfect place to have breakfast or lunch . They have freshly squeezed orange juice , pancakes and waffles with fresh fruit . Friendly management and staff . Waxhaw , NC is lucky to have this little gem .<->1
Quick service and friendly staff . The peanut sauce is highly recommended , very good !<->2
I was satisfied . Service was good . Food was decent . Prices were ok . There was no wait on a saturday morning . The apple sauce was the best dish on the table .<->1
Good food , good drinks , friendly staff , kinda pricey but worth an occasional splurge !<->2
Your usual IKEA , easy to get to . I mostly come for the yogurt ice cream and that 's about it .<->2
Great Korean Chinese restaurant . I tried stir fried jjambbong rice , jjajang & fried rice and tangsuyook and all three dishes were really good . I like this place better than the other one at Sahara .<->1
got takeout the other night - salmon teriyaki . two large pieces of salmon - delicious meal ! thanks again !<->1
I 've never heard of this place but I had it delivered to me via Doordash and my drink was so good ! ! I got the white chocolate mocha . Yum ! Ca n't wait to stop in .<->1
Very disappointed they ran out of average things in the menu . No pork tacos and no chai tea . Better be better prepard<->0
Nummmmmmy a little piece of Mexico in Vegas go on an empty stomach ! The Mulitas al Pastor are the best ! Not only are they affordable the cooks are fast ! !<->1
Amazing food and huge servings . Also impeccable service and I love the comfortable atmosphere !<->1
The pots of bread are awesome ! Plus I had the country style eggs benedict , best eggs benedict ever . After visiting Portland this summer , we were looking for something like that in Vegas and this is it .<->1
friendly service and great ice cream :)<->1
The coffee and atmosphere are great here . I love to visit local coffee shops and this one is now at the top of my list .<->1
We absolutely love this place . The brothers who own this place are so friendly , and the food is wonderful . Definitely a hidden gem that we love eating at !<->1
Literally .. Best hamburger ever ! ! Ordering medium - rare was a mistake ! Could not eat fast enough ! ! Do not skip this place ! !<->1
Just finished ! Dang their ribs were great . I was pleasantly surprised ! Great portions too !<->1
It was my first time here at Egg Works and I got ta say that I loved it ! I got the Works skillet and it was so amazing . Thank you to our server Maryann for the wonderful service ! ! !<->1
Ordered from Courtney . Very professional . Was very happy with the customer service she portrayed . I called the wrong Chili 's . They took care of me and told me it was no problem . Thanks Courtney .<->1
Delighted to have discovered this place ! I tried the avocado salad , ramen and sushi pizza and was impressed with all 3 . The ramen was n't overly salty which was great . Will definitely go back !<->1
Great value and excellent food . Spaghetti and meatballs tasted authentic and only $ 6.25 ! Their gumbo with white rice was also excellent . For a great meal at an affordable price on Fremont Street , you ca n't go wrong with this place .<->1
Very good ... I had been craving good chili cheese fries for a long time and these were very delicious . They are enough to share . .. trust me ! The burgers are full of flavor and very good all around !<->1
Friendly staff and very attentive . So far , the Ruben is my favorite . All in all , a great sports bar / grill .<->1
I had to change my review . After going there repeatedly , I came to realize this is an overpriced dive bar that over serves people constantly . Even for Scottsdale , the prices are ridiculous .<->0
Ordered carne asada fries and got no carne . They wo nt even replace it . All the cashier said was " my bad " .<->0
Great pork chile verde and chicken fried steak . Surprisingly , subpar eggs for a breakfast joint . Reasonably priced and overall very good food .<->1
Excellent Peking Duck ! Succulent and tasty . Reasonably priced at $ 39.99 , but there is extra charge for Duck soup . Good choices for Dim Sum . Well arranged menu with illustrations .<->1
Wonderfull Valentines Day meal and service .<->1
Never disappointed ! The food is delicious ! The short rib fried rice and the chicken skewers are my favorite but I 'm sure everything else ca n't be far off . This is officially my favorite Thai spot ! :)<->1
Pizza Palermo is SO good , always very accommodating , and the workers are so kind . I love coming here !<->1
Really wanted to like it . Tried it twice . Not good . Do n't bother . Great location is the only good I can say .<->0
Best pastrami I 've had in the longest time ever ! coming from California they had some major competition . Only bad thing is the wait is a tad bit long so not good if you 're in a hurry .<->1
Great spot to sit outside and watch the football games . Awesome bartender Meagan at the outside bar b<->1
Nice staff , trendy crowd , good music , overall good ambiance , food and cocktails are ok<->2
This place has gone downhill . We go to Popos on 59th Ave now . We used to be a Manuel 's loyal customer but the wait times and the screw ups on to - go orders have ended our loyalty .<->0
Been waiting to be paid out on a machine they do n't have the time or the people do n't used to like this place but it 's bad service<->0
Such a great place ! ! Excellent service , I ordered food and did n't know there were pork in it , and I do n't eat pork , and they changed it without charging any fees ! ! Definitely gon na come back again ! ! !<->1
Decent place to get some Vietnamese cuisine . The service is quick , the food is good , and the prices are cheap . The Vietnamese Iced coffee was sooo good .<->1
Nice ambiance for casual food . Two of us split a burger and nachos and it was very filling .<->1
Their cook is an elderly filipina lady ( from ilocos sur , condon ? ) , her taste of cooking - - fills me up ! i really like their pancit , banana lumpia ( turon ) , and many more ...<->1
Delicious coffee every time . Prices comparable to Starbucks , but quality is much better . Usually decently fast service , too .<->1
I 'm struggling to see the draw here . I had the chocolate shake , which was on par with what you get at McDonald 's , but at a much higher price point ( $ 6 ) .<->0
omg ! ! ! so many delicious flavors ! i love this place ! ps . pick one up for your pup !<->1
OMG ! I . Forgot to mention their French fries ! I think they are double fried or something because it was a pile of salty extra crispy goodness .<->1
Good clean restaurant ! Recommend the jalapeño hummus bowl ! Chicken Kabob was subpar , but the rest of the bowl was on point !<->1
overcooked rice , dry chicken , this place just did nt do it for me . I doubt i will be back . In fact , with so many choices around them , I 'm sure i wo nt be back .<->0
They make their own ranch dressing , it 's really good ! I really liked their grilled blackened chicken salad . Service was very friendly ( though it was very slow there when I went ) .<->1
2 Thumbs up Rocco 's nailed it with the New York Style pizza . Best I 've had in a while<->1
We have been here several times , food and service are great . Yesterday was no exception . There was a minor issue that was corrected immediately . Kudos to the manager and our wait staff . Our favorite spot for breakfast .<->1
Wonderful full - bodied veggie miso ramen with really interesting ingredients and flavors . Very cool sesame shochu . Dark svelte intimate interior .<->1
I like this place , always my go to for good tacos ! But all the food is good . Make sure you try different things in the menu , you wo n't be disappointed .<->1
Great food . Great service . Enrique was our waiter and he was great . Food was delicious and big portions . All organic . Nice atmosphere . Chef Paco came out to see how the food was .<->1
Delicious tacos for $ 1.How can you beat that ? Plus freshly - made tortillas ! ! ! Best deal on the Charleston Taco Corridor ! ! ! Plus nice people . And the sweetest Mamacita ever , making the tacos in the truck . I always throw her a kiss as I leave a satisfied customer .<->1
Very cute coffee " lab " . Great patio facing the park . I had a ice green tea and it was good and decently priced . I would definitely like to hang out here again if I 'm in the area .<->1
Very nice store good customer service it 's close to my house so I visit 1,2 times a day I love it<->1
Tried it b / c of a wagjag offer . Food is horrible . Worst burger I 've had in a long time . Better off going to a truck stop . Shocked that this was the ' royal York ' 's pub . Closed on the weekends ? ? ?<->0
Where 's my meatloaf ! ? Mom , the meatloaf ! ! ! We have been waiting over an hour ! ! Boo , this suck balls<->0
Consistently good I 've been eating here for years it 's the best Italian food in Charlotte<->1
This place is great for happy hour and if they are not crazy busy , if they are slammed do n't waste your time - they ca n't handle it well . Happy hour at sushi table is a great deal for sure .<->1
Good pizza ! Great chicken parm and garlic knots . My favorite menu item , the Cuban Sandwich , phenomenal !<->1
If we are in Vegas , this place is a must ! ! ! You will not be disappointed ! And if you are , it 's because you lack taste in food ! Everyone is very friendly and attentive ! This place is perfect for the whole family !<->1
Today I had my lunch . I ordered chicken Alfredo pink with pink souse and calamari . Everything was really fresh and hot . Small family business nice service quite place for family . Will be back for sure .<->1
I go here with my gf and when the food comes , we literally do not speak to each other until the food is all gone .<->1
Great service & great atmosphere ( every time for me ) , excellent menus and a great brunch ! And the bar 's Bloody Mary is delicious ... horseradish , olive ( s ) and a strip of crispy bacon ! Ask for a little spicier and a salted rim !<->1
Amazing food and great atmosphere ! Love the attentive service . Will definitely be going back !<->1
Adequate service . Huge servings . Mediocre at best food for extravagant prices . Will probably not come back .<->2
excellent restaurantgood was goodservice above averageHighly recommend<->1
Good barbacoa tacos yummy . Delicious beans and rice . Great quesadillas ! ! Try the mochis tacos de barbacoa ! !<->1
Fantastic . Family owned , the staff here take their jobs particularly serious and will not leave you alone until you 're completely satisfied . The prices are n't bad , and if there 's a wait , its worth it !<->1
A - Freaking - Mazing ! ! ! Nicole , you are my new best friend ! ! ! Ordered the doodlewich and it was awesome , soooo huge though , had to split it with a co - worker . My ONLY regret is not discovering them sooner .<->1
This place is always on point some of the Best Authentic Mexican Food in Az . Friendly Staff , Always Spotless Clean , Cheap Prices , if you 've never tried it your missing out<->1
Food , Friends and Fun ! Great place if you can get a reservation for your party . Hard to walk into . Scratch kitchen makes the food very enjoyable .<->1
The onion soup is over salty , the burger was ok the American mule was OK but not good . I do n't sure that I will stop again in this restaurant . The classic American food is really weak !<->0
I have one word to describe Indulge ... BLAAAAAH ! service was super slow and the burger was so so . There are many many better options for a burger in The Valley . Do n't waste your time or money here .<->0
Excellent salads and boxes . I have tried the Sparta and Winter greens box . It 's a fresh great financial district option . Dressing are given on the side .<->1
The bartender on Saturday around 5 pm was legit . Made every drink amazing . Really enjoyed my time at the eatery .<->1
Great breakfast ! Loved the potato cakes . Thanks Tara for the great service ! We 'll definitely be back to this location .<->1
al pastor and lengue tacos really really good ! hombres behind counter made a good show of knife skills and a littlle showmanship on plating . clean tables and friendly staff . pretty authhentic for a chain .<->1
Ay dios mio , the Chile Relleno was to die for ! And homemade tortillas , yum . Solid fare in downtown Mesa .<->1
I love the food here ! I always order the carne asado burrito in a bowl ( no tortilla ) because I eat low carb . It 's always a ton of food and really good ! Our service is usually really good too . Highly recommend !<->1
First time . Staff is nice . Typical bar and typical Charlotte food aka crap . But if you were born in the south you may like it . North people stay away<->0
Food is delicious - full of rich and interesting tastes . Location and view are amazing ... BUT the restaurant is dirty - food on walls very dirty Windows which make it hard to see the view ... kinda grossed us out .<->1
Best sushi I 've had here , really fresh tasting . It 's casual and the ordering and payment system was a little confusing the first time we went , but we will go out of our way to eat there again .<->1
Super slow hipsters working at their own pace . You 're at an airport , so speed it up since people have flights to catch . Oh , and my coffee was luke warm when I finally got it .<->2
Excellent burgers . Simple , cooked well with fresh ingredients . Good crispy fries . Will come here as an alternative to the TERRIBLE food and service at nearby Sonic and Tailgaters ( which closed , thank goodness ) .<->1
Always great food and good portions . We prefer long horn steakhouse over any other steak house .<->1
Amazing customer service ! ! ! Octavio was very kind and helpful . Everyone had a positive attitude , greeted us in and out , and the pizza was phenomenal . I would highly recommend anyone to come here ! !<->1
Great homemade food . Family owned and operated , which creates a homey and welcoming dining experience . The selection of unique beers is also excellent .<->1
This was a great place for breakfast . Although there was a long line , service moved very quickly . The Oreo donut ( new ) was delicious and the hash brown was pretty good too . The bottled apple juice was kind of small , though .<->1
I agree with everything Sarah K . said . It was my first time today , and the Arizona panini was great , and the free donut fresh . I 'll be going back to try their salads , and coffee .<->1
Cowboy Ciao is fantastic ! There is a variety of great food . The staff is courteous and quick . It is family friendly and is fun environment . I can not wait to go back !<->1
I occasionally go here when I 'm in the area . Overall it 's average pizza - could do with some more sauce , but the crust is delicious .<->2
What you expect . Open after midnight because it 's 12:30 am and I am here . Staff are really nice . Food is from a big Trumpland chain .<->2
All you can eat was amazing ! Fresh sushi and great service ! The white tuna melts in your mouth like butter .<->1
Great sushi . They give you a good portion and it 's always buy one get one half off . Ca nt beat that !<->1
So bummed that it 's closed ! I was looking forward to lunch here on my visit to Madison this weekend ! Loved this place<->1
Great service and excellent pizza . Cool vibe and great atmosphere . Will definitely be back<->1
Very good lychee and black sesame ice creams from this hybrid shop .<->1
Delicious little snacks but not very filling for the price ...<->2
We 've tried this place a couple of times . The sushi is pretty good here , but the service is spotty at best .<->0
Aloha friendly staff will make you smile . Great food a little higher on price but it 's all fresh so worth it . The fish tacos are amazing and coconut shrimp is super good . Great lunch spot .<->1
Great pizza subs and wings . The sub rolls are fresh from Mancini . AWESOME . They delivered in the time they quoted and employees are super friendly<->1
The service was friendly and prompt . We did n't have to wait for our refills or our order to be taken . The food arrived and was well prepared and tasted delicious .<->1
Checked it out , had a coffee and just sat around reading for a few hours . Not bad . Great environment and I loved how peaceful it was !<->1
Loved this quiet quaint coffee shop which was walking distance from the golden nugget hotel as well as Fremont street . They accommodated our keto diet too ! !<->1
I thought the beer was good ! I noticed this will be the 400th yelp review ! Can I get a what what ! ? Ok how about a free beer next time ? Looking forward to trying food next time .<->1
The best strawberries ... close to my house , kettle corn and some local veggies . Nice quick run nice area , sadly it is only the 1st and 3rd Saturday of the month ! ! ! I wish it was weekly !<->1
I had this once at my sister 's and I have n't been able to get it out of my head since ! The Tropic Thunder was outstanding !<->1
Been here twice , had the beef kabob the first time and the lamb chops the second time , both were overcooked .<->2
The service was good and the food was amazing ! The staff is very friendly and lunch prices are cheap . Two people who order 2 appetizers and 2 entrees usually end up with a $ 30 bill .<->1
Hidden inside a business complex . Great choice of sandwiches and salads . Really enjoyed this place , super quick .<->1
Well . It hit the spot after a night of drinking . I do not like their rice . Overall the service was good and the food was okay .<->2
Amazing spot ! Great burgers , and our server Tasha made our experience so great . We came from Chicago to visit - it has a really cool sports feel and cozy seating . Check it out - -<->1
Came here with my adventurous food friend . I thought the service was great and the food was even better . The décor is dated and needs work ... Will come back if I have a Korean craving !<->2
FAIL ! ! ! My friend and I went last night only to find a closed restaurant and notice on the door that they are behind on their rent . Why was n't the website updated ? So yeah , looks like Phil 's is no more .<->0
La qualité des makis et des sashimis est excellente . Le service et l'ambiance est parfait . On a adoré tout nos choix de maki . Tout est très frais et délicieux . On a y retourner certainement .<->1
Really good chile verde , rice , and chile relleno . Service is a little iffy , so got ta go in with a little patience .<->2
Public health orders a Hepatitis clinic because a staff member has hepatitis A<->0
We just moved to FH and we love this place . The pulled pork is so yummy and the prices are cheap . We always have great service too . We 've tried other restaurants in FH and none top this place !<->1
Worst food ever . No egg in the egg foo young , was like a corn meal lump covered in gravy . The white rice was under cooked . Really not even the rice was decent .<->0
LOVE LOVE LOVE this place ! They have a black cherry smoothie off and on that is THE best ! I just wish they had it all the time !<->1
Do not be fooled by its plain Jane looks . This place has great food with daily specials that looks pretty solid . The breakfast plates are awesome . The have gaming and the machines are ok . I will definitely be back .<->1
I love this restaurant ! The people are awesome ! They remember your name when you call them up for great take out !<->1
Fresh sushi , great service . Used to go here alot when it was sapporo sushi . Still the same great food no complaints<->1
Burgers were amazing ! Truffle fries were awesome ! The funnel cake looked amazing with the peaches , but we were too full to get it . Everyone was super friendly and everything is very fresh ! ! ! Definitely a great place to check out !<->1
Great authentic Mexican food . ! The staff was very polite and friendly . It is located about 5 miles away from the strip .<->1
So good and the service was great to . Family of 5 and ate for under $ 50 and a huge portion .<->1
We all ordered sandwiches for brunch with my family and we all rated about a 5/10 . We did n't like the chips that it came with either . They were mostly soggy but the crispy one were good . It 's fairly priced too .<->2
The grilled cheese pizza is nasty ! I would n't waste money on it again ! Buy something else<->0
Their alfredo pizza is the best ! We also love their lasagna , calzones , and chicken salads . Luciano 's is always near the top of our list for a great local restaurant .<->1
The coconut cake and blackout cake were very good . We look forward to trying out some other items next time we are in the area .<->1
Small place but great street tacos ! Friendly staff , come check them out .<->1
I had a strawberry banana smoothie . Very good ! ! The Batista was very nice and friendly !<->1
Worst customer service I have ever seen at a panda , wo n't smile are not friendly . even when u say thank you . they will not even look at u . ill never come to this one again .<->0
This place is very slow ! The service here took 15 - 20 minutes to make a basic 4 for $ 4 meal ! I 'm pretty disappointed with this establishment !<->0
If you get take out , check your order before you leave . I 've gotten the wrong thing twice .<->0
My experience here was amazing . Me and my family really enjoyed our meal . Our waiter was the best ! Fyi the hot chocolate is to die for !<->1
We come here often after dinner to get a very tasty but inexpensive macaroons and sorbet . The owners are always in and are very polite .<->1
I usually go here when i have a date . My experience at Al dente always been great with good quality food . I had shrimp cocktail , bottle of wine veal parmesan and seafood Linguine . Will visit here soon .<->1
Mediocre food , nice atmosphere . The best food to get is chicken tandori . Considering Calgary 's options , one of the bests !<->0
Great food , good atmosphere , good service . We had both lunch and dinner there , and were served dinner by Jason , a fine young man who provided us with great service and a big smile !<->1
New ownership .. Smoked Meat is a little inconsistent now .. Greek salad still the best but no way they get my 5 stars .<->2
Great gelato and great customer service . The young lady that waited on us was fantastic answering our questions . The roasted almond was out of this world . Clean and spotless facility .<->1
Decent supermarket . No disasters to report on ! Service was friendly .<->2
Great beer and food . My brother got the PB & J burger and loved it ! Our waitress was great ! We will be back !<->1
Best greek food in Chandler . My favorite dishes include the specialty hummus , chicken shwarma pitta w / greek fries , and the lamb platter . You really ca n't go wrong with anything on the menu though !<->1
Zips is one of my favorite resrants in phx prices are good and food is better !<->1
If you love seafood this is the place . Service is amazing , Ryan G provided me and my guest amazing service . Highly recommend , the menu offers many options . Love it .<->1
My least favorite Mexican food in the area . A lot of hype for bad service and even worse food . I will not be visiting again .<->0
Hmmm , well we were the only two people in there .. and the food took 25 minutes . For a gyro and a veggie pita ? ? ? After that , it was n't anything all that good :( Meh , probably not going to go back .<->0
Smoothies are fine . Just like any other Jamba Juice location . However , this location never honors it 's Groupon deals , which needs to be fixed . Stop posting Groupons or honor them , Bell location !<->0
The food was ridiculously good . The decor was beautiful ... Giant chalet fireplace , antler chandeliers , etc . Waitress was a pro . Will def go back . The miso butter on the black cod was killer . YUM !<->1
the " combination with choice of 2 meats " is actually putting 2 meats in 1 sandwich . I like their potato latkas though .<->0
Do n't know what the fuss is about here . Breakfast with co - worker and it was ok , not delivered hot and was very bland . Server was very good though .<->0
We have 3 people , and we were not hungry that much so we only ordered a few dishes . They automatically charge 18 % gratuity when we check .<->0
How can you beat $ 3.95 breakfast ? $ . 99 Bloody Mary ( small but what did you expect ? ) I would definitely go back again<->1
Super slow service . Took them 45 mins to make 3 shaved ice . The waitress are day dreaming , have to ask twice for everything . This is not my first time there , service is very slow .<->0
Second time here and have n't been disappointed . Not only do you get a cool little lightbulb souvenir option but the drinks and hospitality are good . My favorite is the rose milk tea !<->1
Really small , quaint place right outside of the AGO . Had a quick bite to eat and it was delicious ! Reasonable prices and attentive staff . Will be back .<->1
Great sushi and very good and fast service . I have been there a few times and have not been disappointed .<->1
A little cute Japanese Restaurant on Yonge Street . My wife very much enjoyed the Unagi Kimchi Donburi and the sushi was fresh . We would come back .<->1
New location but same great people and food ! ! Might be a little pricey but well worth it . As a Peruvian myself I can tell you this is the real deal so come and try it ! ! !<->1
That dessert was good but all the tables where dirty and I had to clean it my self before sitting down but if you are looking for a quick snack stop by .<->2
Very very very friendly and helpful staff . The juices are delish ! Good vibes here ! Love it !<->1
One of the best meals I had while staying in Vegas for a week ! I had the original chicken & waffles .. it was amazing ! ! Do n't skip on this place !<->1
We are looking forward to tasting Bobby 's food . My children are a fan of his show and so far , his bread is amazing !<->1
The food was amazing and huge I love this place have no complaints the customer service was awesome I would recommend this place to a friend<->1
Handmade , in - store fine candies aand chocolates are awesome ( way better than See 's , but higher priced ) . The owners are really great people !<->1
Really good food and great service . Lots of choices Great service from xiao xiao will be back for sure ...<->1
They should post that the 10 % off promotion they have if you follow their instagram or we chat is only for dine - in customers . Got my hopes up for now reason :(<->0
Bueno ? buenissimmo ! Le digo ... dijo mi compa Chuy ... no but really , it really good ... that carne en su caldo is awesome .<->1
Greek salad with chicken kabob was very good . Spanakopita was delicious - be sure to ask for it to be warmed a bit ! !<->1
Authentic flavor , great customer service , quick to bring out your food , friendly , attentive and always make Birthday surprises fun . Favorite Mexican restaurant in town !<->1
Excellent 8 course meal and service to go along with it ! If you have not gone yet , you are missing out on amazing tasting food . Thanks to all at DTF for the memorable meal and evening .<->1
This is definitely not the best ice cream place in Toronto but if you 're only looking for simple flavored ice cream such as vanilla , this is the place . One last thing ... they do n't accept credit card .<->2
Very decent steak ! And I had the bone marrow too , it 's a little oily just by itself , I wish they can make it just a sauce . Coffee comes with 3 alcoholic chocolate spoons . I love their coffee<->1
Buffet was decent . I recommend trying the fried chicken . Too much food for me though . Service was so so , took a minute for my drinks .<->2
This place is always busy but for me it is hit and miss . Sometimes the food is delishious and sometimes it is rotten .<->2
OK but not as generous in size and ingredients as the pho at da vang , where many vietnamese dine .<->2
Dim sum is great for the price ! Much better than some of the other options in the are and Chinatown :)<->1
Awesome service ! Always smiling . Clean place and as always , delicious food at really good prices .. Could n't think of a better spot for football game food or late night munchies<->1
Love this place - Amazing cortado 's and delicious cookies . Staff are super friendly and the atmosphere is perfect for hanging around and catching up with a friend . Highly recommend !<->1
Our breakfast was Luke warm for as long as we wait it ! The couple that walked in after us got there drinks and there food before us , must been regulars they are more imported !<->0
Chorizo potato taco on homemade yellow corn tortilla and skirt steak taco yum chai latte almond milk hot or cold your choice . Bravo I will return , lovely fresh salsas<->1
Great BBQ and I liked the homemade donuts that they make right in the open by the front of the restaurant . I will definitely come back and eat there again the next time I come to Mesa !<->1
Something goes wrong every time I go to this McDonalds . I get the wrong order , my order is messed up , or my order is forgotten . Terrible service .<->0
first time here . i ordered the beef plate . very good , authentic korean food , huge service , awesome customer service ! what 's not to like ?<->1
One of the best Chinese Restaurants around . I usually have the General Tso Chicken which is always spicy and good . The portion sizes are huge so you wo n't go hungry .<->1
I ordered the spartan pizza + jalapeños and it was delicious ! The delivery time took about an hour but the driver was very friendly and meet me right by the curb in front of the building . Highly recommended !<->1
Sub par buffet with the worst service you will EVER receive ...<->0
Yum yum this place is super good . Everything I have ordered has been very good . The sushi , shrimp fried rice and egg drop soup are my favorite .<->1
Came here around lunch and it was n't too busy . Pros : - Seating area - Well priced - Good service - Kawartha Ice CreamCons : - None ( gelato would be nice though )<->1
The filet with the red wine reduction ? Are you kidding me ? Closest thing to Heaven on the strip . Seriously , I need to learn how to make that . It was AMAZING !<->1
Margaritas great especially at happy hour . Fish tacos good . Chips and salsa were plenty and delicious . Chicken tamales were mostly chicken , but good sauce . Would recommend this place for Mexican meal and it is inside New York , New York !<->1
This is one of my favorite local wine bars in town ! Excellent food , wine and atmosphere ! The staff is friendly , plenty of parking and fabulous patio ! Be sure to save room for the smores dessert .<->1
Really good pizza with good pricing . Wish their delivery started a little earlier in the day , though .<->2
This place has great service .. yummy breakfast .. and a kick back atmosphere . I love it here !<->1
It was an inviting and comfortable place . Good variety of food and food service too . Favourite dish was Hummus platter . A must try for all !<->1
First time going here and did take out . This place is clean and comfortable . The staff was extremely helpful . I got the cheeseburger and OMG it was delicious . I think I just found my new place for food .<->1
Holy portions batman -- great family style food . Biggest side salad ever ! Staff was helpful and friendly -- loads of soda refills .<->1
Excellent steaks . The seafood tower was amazing . Recommend the porterhouse with the lite ginger sauce and peppers !<->1
If you are looking for a place to get a great burger , this is that place . The burgers , fries , and customer service was excellent . Definitely will be coming back .<->1
Everything was great ! I got the lobster bisque and shrimp with lobster fettuccine . My husband got the carbonara and we split the warm chocolate cake for dessert ... everything was really good !<->1
Only ever get the whopper , and all the burger kings make them the same ... so I 'm pretty happy . Nuff said<->1
A hIdden gem off the strip . Only 10min cab from stripReally good food and good value here , wish i could 've tried more . Try the bruseel sprouts . They have great deals during there happy hour times . Def must try<->1
My go - to sushi spot ! Good quality sushi and great taste ! The restaurant is clean and the service is good and they also have hibachi tables for steak dinners !<->1
Best food and drinks around . Very small so go early or make reservations for dinner . Menu changes every few months . Have eaten here several times and every meal has been great !<->1
This is the best buffet in Vegas ! So amazing but there is a long wait so make sure you check in first .<->1
I do n't see what the rave is about . The patty is very thin , buns too thick . Tastes no better than chain fast food joints , but charges a lot more . Wo n't come back<->2
No sushi love here anymore . Everyone who lives in South End 's pink building just got sued by Nikkos . Boo ! https://www.charlotteagenda.com/45766/everyone-lives-south-ends-pink-building-just-got-sued/<->0
Deliciojs spot ! This is the OG spot . Their duck confit and butter chicken pierogis were delicious and extremely filling . Will definitely leave room for th dessert ones next time !<->1
Delicious , the only hard part is deciding what to eat & finding indoor seating but it 's definitely worth it ! ! !<->1
Awesome customer service . They gave us free samples to try before you buy . Food was delicious ! My young children loved it . We will be back for sure .<->1
Wow the banana nut muffin is excellent ! Moist , soft but has a crutch top . It hit the spot ! First bite is like fireworks ! Coffee is great with my fav French vanilla creamer . Definitely will be coming back here !<->1
I 've tried multiple ramen places and I never finished my bowls , up until now I never liked ramen . I love this place ! We ordered the DanDan and the Beef Stew bowls , they were amazing . Will definitely be coming back .<->1
Food is good but the service is not great . The waitress were n't friendly . We did n't receive one of our order until we inquired about it , that happened when we finish our dinner .<->0
Buen sazón , Calidad , buen servicio , menú muy variado , pero falta mejorar la forma de pedir los tacos es un poco confusa si es la primera vez que vas a este lugar , En general buen restaurante .<->1
I really liked this place . The cooks were really friendly and the sandwiches were really tasty . It 's a great place for some quick , tasty ( but greasy ) food . :)<->1
I just had the best $ 6 lunch of my life . The Mongolian beef awesome ! Please try this place out !<->1
One of the best places to go in this part of town . They have a homemade tonic , and great gin selection ! The food is good , overall it 's a quality establishment with quality guests !<->1
This place is awesome ! Truly authentic . Be careful with the pretzel rolls before your meal . You can fill up quickly with how incredible they are !<->1
This is the place to good for huge gooey sandwiches . It is what it is . As another reviewer said , you may like it more when you 're drunk ... At lunchtime , bring an appetite or split one for two people .<->2
Service was friendly , attentive and prompt . We dined in the bar and really enjoyed the wonderful piano and singing .<->1
What a great spot , my wife and I are traveling and this place hit the spot . Their happy hour selection is great , I had the pulled pork . Try build your own tacos !<->1
First time here . Came with family that had been here before . Everything came out quickly . The pizza was good but the garlic knots were outstanding . I will definitely be back .<->1
Average haka Chinese place . More meant as a take out . ONLY accept cash or debit . NO Credit Cards . So come prepared .<->2
Plenty of dance space but drinks are pricy . DJs are a mix bag . With the high summer heat they need to turn the AC up cause it was too hot inside last night .<->2
The wings and calamari was okay with an okay price to split with friends . The service was nice too , though there was n't enough meat on the wings so it did n't live up to my expectation in good wings .<->2
We come here all of the time , it 's always fresh , and the staff is always friendly . The cinnamon buns are the best as well as the raspberry brownies .<->1
Pretty slow , and the service is subpar . Only thing keeping this place alive is the food .<->2
Chicken ramen was awesome and so filling ! We also had an order of edamame to finish out the meal . So good !<->1
Went there for the first time . Nice selection . The apple fritter was the best I 'd ever had . I am looking forward to have another one soon .<->1
love this place . my go to spot when i 'm in toronto.the pizza is the italian way , not north american . the salads ... wow again .<->1
Restroom needed some touched up . On the way to restroom passing by bar area paper towel on the floor displayed look unsanitary . Plate for bread needed to be checked under for remains of food sticked in it . Presentation<->1
Prices are what are expected of a hotel restaurant . My bbq ribs were good , the gf chicken was a bit dry . But who cares they have SOMORES .<->1
While not as good as Fiesta Burrito , this place is an okay substitute .<->2
Check your health - consciousness at the door and get ready for an amazing ice - cream experience that makes you feel like a kid again . Ca n't wait to go back !<->1
Amazing find . Had the bouillabaisse and it was full of buttery , delicious shellfish . Staff is fun , lighthearted and attentive . Chef Ricardo kept us laughing . Could n't ask for a better experience .<->1
The Hot Rocks appetizer is absolutely amazing ! I wish it was larger so I can get it as an entree . The seabass made a great entree however , so it worked out !<->1
Closest food to authentic mexican food ! Its delicious and the home made tortillas are priceless !<->1
HUGE PORTIONS . I felt that needed to go first . Honestly their portions are good for two . Its open 24hrs so its great if you can do the drive after some late night clubbing . Food is good and cheap .<->1
AMAZING PIZZA & real NY vibe ! ! ! Great customer service , and family ran , to back the amazing food ! Great place ! ! !<->1
Came here for a valentine 's day . Ordered rigatoni pasta and penne arrabiatta . Both good , decent spot , not the greatest , would n't come back . My lady got a free rose from the waiter though , lol .<->2
A little wait for the food to arrive , but really good tasting pancakes , breakfast potatoes , bacon , and orange juice ! Local locations growing , so food and service getting building a reputation !<->1
delicious chicken shawarma , owner was very friendly and service was great ! definitely recommend .<->1
I stopped in while traveling based on other reviews . I tried the orange chicken and egg rolls both were fantastic . The dining room is clean and larger than most strip mall Chinese joints .<->1
Clean with friendly employees . Located Next to Starbucks . I love the mayo and mustard is mixed ... that 's my favorite thing about Port of Subs ! !<->1
When I stay at the Venetian in Vegas , I always have breakfast here . Great coffee and omelettes ! It 's a bit pricey breakfast ... but then again , you 're in Vegas !<->2
Great food and service . Jarrett was friendly and super fast . Will definitely return . Had a great time .<->1
Great and affordable place ! Large selection of appetizers on their menu and the food I 've tried so far has been very tasty . I like to sit outside , in their terasse , during the summer , inside can get a little loud .<->1
Every reviewer thinks their an expert , well I am to so all I 'm going to say is that this a tacobell not a 3 michelin star restaurant . Tacobell ! ! !<->1
Go here every weekend . Quality staff and atmosphere . Breakfast is great , but do n't sleep on lunch at Hanger . The Greek menu options are great .<->1
Great service , food came quickly and was delicious . I love the premium marinated steak , galbisal . All you can eat is the best way to live life . Also Luna was awesome .<->1
I learry rike lice . Dis one numba one !<->0
For what it is , it is pretty great . Good service . Tasty foods . Great beer selection . Cool environment . A great , quick stop .<->1
Their view is amazing . Go there for LUNCH TIME because it 's cheaper . The food is OKAY , and the set up of the restaurant is awkward , but you get a GREAT VIEW of the Bellagio and SERVICE IS GREAT !<->1
Service was horrible . Waitress gave me attitude for asking what the most popular dish was and how large the portions were . Will never come back here again .<->0
A Thai meal to compare all others too ! The BEST Thai in the Valley of the Sun ! Tom Yum and Pad Thai are our top favorites . This place is a must !<->1
1st visit , the sandwich was fresh but way over priced especially since there was not a lot of meat on sandwich and no chips or drink is offered with expensive turkey sandwich .<->0
Great feel , good food best humus ever . A little on the pricey side but I will be back<->1
BJ 's has something for everyone , and their food is delicious ! The wait was n't too long and my burger was cooked to perfection . I hear their pizookies are to die for . I definitely recommend this place .<->1
Really like the concept but they sure skimp on the toppings if you get anything other then red sauce and mozzarella . I 'll add a pic of my pizza that had large bubbles in it do to the lack of toppings .<->0
This is a great local mom and pop shop that everyone needs to support . The portions are large , the food is great and the staff is amazing . Stephan the manager is helpful , fun and engaging .<->1
I ca nt believe people think this is good sushi . The 8 piece chef special was sour and soggy . Very over priced and terrible . Save your money . I was ripped off .<->0
hello once again we stop in to get a pizza from our place we go because it feels like family there and we enjoy going yum yum from movie mike<->1
Love to go for brunch and hear music on Sundays . Their food is always fantastic . My favorite thing right now is the farm scramble with eggs , gruyere , potatoes , cheddar , onion , and herbs with a side of bacon .<->1
Good coffee but super expensive and the line is long . We got two medium black drip coffees and the total was well over $ 10 .<->0
Love this place , food seems more salty than normal . Maybe a new way of things but could not finish our meal . Sad<->1
Spiciest Pad Thai I 've had , good food for good price . I recommend it , just not for the service .<->1
Best place to watch soccer on the weekends . The servers are all awesome , and the management is great . New cocktail menu is really tasty . Make sure you order the CHICKEN CLUB with the fries !<->1
Only 2 tap beers ! Pricey beer / drinks . 1/4 Wedge salad for $ 9.95 ! Great view . Mediocre service . This place is really missing out on an opportunity to maximize revenue from their amazing patio / location / view .<->2
Love the food ! ! ! Big portion tender steaks and all the sides dishes were tasty and delicious . Definitely come back again<->1
Fast , inexpensive , and pretty good quality take out food . Plus the employees are very nice and ensure they know exactly what you would like to order . I will definitely be eating here again .<->1
They use to have good sized burgers . Less meat now . For the price I would think more meats . Salads and lemonade are still great .<->1
My favorite Indian lunch buffet in town .. Clean restaurant with excellent service and lots of options . Parking is a pain and you may have to search for a few mins . Good prices and quality<->1
Meh ! Too much salt on foods . Cleanliness is poor . I used the bathroom to clean up and I felt worse after washing up . Everything was greasy . Ugh ! ! ! Nice employees . You ca n't really expect much from an average place . Sorry .<->2
Great experience and great drinks ! We ordered the Milk Tea with Boba and a Peach Green Tea with Mango Popping Boba . So delicious , refreshing , and very kind service ! This will be our summer drink stop ! Thank you Boba Craze !<->1
Best Trinidad food ever . Worst service ever , just like Trinis ... hahaha . They can cook good food and party . I guess that s all that matters .<->2
Delicious smoothies and juices ! The staff is friendly and provides great service . Very clean and beautiful space . This is a must try !<->1
I 've been enjoying Danny Boys Pizza since late 90s when I lived in Cleveland area . Get here early ! Waits can be long . Great pizza , great bread sticks and the nice thing is that it is n't another chain .<->1
Compared to other pizza places in the Flamingo , you get good quality food at about half the price . We went here at 3 am for pizza and around 11 am for breakfast . Stop by if you 're looking for something fast and cheap .<->1
Food good ! Service and wait time sucks ! ! ! Not coming back ! ! ! Staff is clueless ! ! And oblivious to how long I waited for 4 calzones over an hour and 1/2 . Ridiculous<->0
get the mushroom appetizer i forget the namebut its stuffed with cheese and pesto sauce staff is courteous and prices are cheap .<->1
This place has had it 's ups and downs since the new ownership , but lately it has been fantastic . Best Thai curry that I have tasted in the Pittsburgh area !<->1
Excellent place for brunch or dinner ! Great ambiance and the glass panels make the place feel very open . The patio in summer is the perfect place for a drink in the sun !<->1
I get my coffee there almost every morning . The staff is very welcoming and the coffee is excellent . They also have a great selection on baked goods .<->1
Visited from out of town and stopped at this brewery after dinner . Friendly bar tenders and the Good Morning Vietnam beer was amazing !<->1
Worst service I 've ever experienced . Do n't know about the food , never received it . We got kicked out for grabbing our own drinks .<->0
Visited a few days ago and got FOOD POISONING from oasis patio food : s I could barely get out of bed .. I would seriously question the cleanliness .. I will not go back<->0
Went for lunch with the work crowd , We ordered a variety of food and it was all good !<->1
We had the bacon popcorn and it was so good ! Came back later and got the frank and beans and it was perfect . Great food at a good price and super friendly !<->1
Amazing . Simple menu and a fantastic mix of flavors . Even our kids , who are not familiar with sushi , scarfed down their food . Adults had Yo Adrian , kids had the junior , and PB & A available bowl .<->1
Fantastic food and service . Ordered my filet well done and it came out juicy and tender . All the steaks we 're perfect and the toffee pudding cake was out of this world<->1
Just had our Sunday brunch ... really enjoyed it ! Our waiter Lily and the entire staff really take care of us . We enjoy their great food and service .<->1
Waitress Mariela is not pleasant . Very inconvenient and unprofessional . Would recommend she go back to working at McDonalds .<->0
Try the Original Reuben smoked meat sandwich . Would recommend sandwiches , but the fries leave more to be desired - frozen flavorless shoe strings . Excellent atmosphere and service .<->1
Excellent ! Had a New York steak and it was perfect . Fair price for what you get . Vegas steaks are n't cheap but this was reasonable for the quality .<->1
Visiting Madison and stopped for breakfast . Highly recommend Horst House . Food was good . I had biscuits and gravy . My husband had an omelet . Service was fast and very friendly . Atmosphere is cute and quaint . We will be back !<->1
Margarita Pitchers and to - die - for chips and salsa . Hidden gem on Springfield that puts La Bamba and Dos Reales to shame . Enjoy .<->1
Do n't expect good service at the bar . The greenday - haired bartender lives in a bubble . But , they play good music and have good selection on tap .<->0
Great buffet - had everything I could 've asked for and more . Love all the different food stations and the unlimited juices ! Though some food was quite salty<->1
Perfect meatballs . Everything I have had is the best ! ! The antipasti salad is a must order for the table . It serves four to five people . You ca n't go wrong here . Hands down best Italian food ever at Rao 's .<->1
They have a very good delicious dessert but the customer service is very bad , the staff and the regulations are very tuff and not friendly and professional at all<->0
Very casual place but great food . I had the spicy crunchy roll ( amazing ) , the centipede roll ( very good ) and an eel hand roll ( good but did n't stand out as much ) . Strongly recommend this place !<->1

I loved this place last time I came here , but this time they have a limited menu n the wait is more than 1 hour , never gon na come back here again !<->0
Not worth the money . Lamb rack too sweet , too much alcohol in obster chowder . This is what happens when there 's over crowded people in the restaurant that quality suffers .<->0
Sub par at best . and I mean at BEST . Service is pretty horrible every time , beer is cold , which is just about the only plus .<->0
Great food ! Love the deep fried baby octopus and tentacles ! Love their new ramen . Great atmosphere . Great service .<->1

We 've been looking for a good Chinese restaurant and I think we finally found it ! Service was excellent and the food was wonderful !<->1
How did I not know about this place sooner ? Great pizza and appetizers . I have been looking for a great pizza place in the Avondale area for a long time and I finally found one !<->1
Truly horrible . Six tiny shrimp with a lot of cabbage and no seasoning was a true rip off !<->0
They are always consistent . Great food , friendly people . A nice local gem . The wait on the weekends can be brutal but they make up for it with the great food .<->1
Place is very good . Good wine list , good unique food . Not gigantic portions , which I view as a good thing ...<->1
If you 're not Korean this is n't the spot to come to , they make you feel like an outsider , and the service is horrible . Food is good though , but I would n't recommend it .<->0
One of the real Italian place . Good foods and wine selection . We order the typical dishes and they all turn out the way it should be .<->1
It 's good , the tasting menu is worth trying but next time we will try smth else .<->1
Over priced and service was crazy the server was annoying and did n't listen and try to be salesmen and added to our food without asking us<->2
My partner and I ordered gelato ! The way it was made and mixed were so good ! ! ! Definitely will come back !<->1
Schwartz 's is good but not great . They are famous for being condescending but I feel this is mostly an act to keep up Schwartz 's reputation .<->2

This place is the truth ! ! .. cheers Salty Cellers ! ! .. Lauren is the best ! !<->1
This is a regular place my wife and I eat at in the chandler mall . Great food and the prices are fair . Very clean and the servers do a good job . A +<->1
Love their scallops and various skewers . Drinks are self - serve , which is unique . Their decor is gorgeous . Some staff only speak mandarin , so there is a bit of trouble communicating with them .<->1
We love Desert Donuts ! ! Fresh , made to order donuts that are still warm when you get them ! ! The staff is awesome , too !<->1
Terrible service , terrible food . " If you 've had one drink you are n't allowed in our establishment " that 's what a bouncer said . do n't waste your time here unless you are sober<->0
Love this location , WILL NOT use Postmates for food delivery from CF . Our desserts mysteriously disappeared . Not the CF fault but they need not to partner with Postmates . Our 2nd time and items were missing .<->1
Salad bar was good , but has taken a turn for the worse . If you want yellow lettuce and yellow vegetables , this is the place for you !<->2
This is one of my favorite places in town . The entrees are delicious and affordable - - I especially like the coconut fish . The service is great . And the churros are good too . :)<->1
Just had some good food . Happen to be in the area for some appointment and thought to get something new to eat .<->1

I am so ecstatic that the old owner and has wife are back ! The menus back to original and the food is just as good as it was so grateful made my day<->1
Everything about this mall makes me want to pull out my hair and scream . That said , for folks that like malls it offers lots of options to shoppers .<->2
Decent burritos , incredible customer service . Consistently going above and beyond , they visibly work to go the extra mile .<->1
This is a great pizza place at desert ridge . The food is great and delicious Love it ! ! !<->1
I find it to be so much better than Bev - moron where you can never get any help<->1
Great mom and pop shop . Bets to go during a busy meal time , food is fresher . The family owns a chain of these restaurants . i think 5 of them . this locations is one of the better ones .<->1
Very good Hookah ( Shisha ) at this place also nice waitress love this cafe absolutely will visit them again<->1
Should have given it a 4 but you 'll understand once you order their squid taco . That 's the only disappointment .<->2
So happy this location finally opened ! Rachel and Micki are the best bartenders in west gate ! Atmosphere is awesome , food and drinks are amazing !<->1
Awesome place we loved it ! ! The pastry was excellent the first day but did not travel well . When we got back home it was not worth eating unfortunately !<->1
Great little coffee place and the crepes are awesome also . If you 're in Avondale , you really need to stop by .<->1
Horrible Service . Smell like a kitchen walking out . Decent food . Not sure I would go back , there are better options on the Danforth .<->0
I like the Buffalo Chicken Sandwich here . I also like the selection of beers and flights . Real chill place to go and kick it with some buddies or to start off a night .<->2
Excellent food and service . Red velvet pancakes worth the visit . Love the Hawaiian selections in the menu .<->1
Great , unique food . Super friendly staff . Music was not to my taste , but hey , I think it was at least native to Malaysia .<->1

I have never been as impressed with the level of customer service at Yard House as I have been with Angelica today . The drinks and food were great but the experience was that much better because of our server , Angelica .<->1
Love love love this new place ! ! Love the sangrias ! ! Love Holly , Michelle and Taush . I do n't drink much and usually do n't like beer bars put I can spend hours here . Thx guys ! ! !<->1
I had the BLT . It tasted like a homemade BLT and was loaded with bacon . Was my first time . Must try again soon !<->1
Steaks are good but not the best in terms of proper aging to build flavors . It is a bit business traveler ambiance due to many hotels surrounding it .<->2
We love this place ! Qudos to the Chef that invented their sauce ! It 's always been perfect , never a dry ice , stale taste with their crawfish ! Not oily , just PERFECT !<->1
The late night menu and 5 banquette tables in the bar of this traditional steakhouse make this place into just about the greatest location for hanging in Madison . It 's so good I wish it were a secret .<->1
Variety of food . Pizza was ok and fair prices . This place just does n't have anything special that draws me back .<->2
This is the cutest most authentic French place you can find around . The service is excellent , the Ambiance is great and the food is surprisingly good . I will definitely come back here .<->1
The mango was sold out , we had two strawberry for 29 something . The taste was ok . Price a little expansive . Cash only . Waited for 15mins for two drinks .<->1
Love Fox 's ! ! ! Rib are outstanding , my husband loves the beans , and I 'm a fan of all the meats available !<->1
I 'm glad that Cafe 86 came here to Vegas , the drinks and pastries are really good ! ! ! I do n't leave California w / o a Ube monster on my hand ! ! ! I just love it !<->1
This is a unique dining experience . I come to Phoenix a couple times a year and this is far , the best breakfast in Phoenix . Very casual , relaxing and super food that is fresh and natural .<->1
All you can eat ! 27 $ Good food / fresh / Clean / food come quick . I love Oyster ( Big and Fresh )<->1
This buffeet was ok . Like the separate little rooms with quick wait staff . Went for breakfast / lunch . Lots of egg choices which was nice . Most items were just good , not great . Decent value for the price . Wynn is wayyyyyyyyy better .<->2
The food is good and service can improve . Great ambiance with the country tavern feel . Relaxed and loaded with food .<->0
Omg . The world worst place . Breakfast was nasty , tasted like old left over cold food . Very disointed<->0
See for yourself on the picture . It 's kinda sad the everyone says there so good but there is a maggot in the food and they act like thing happen . That 's not ok<->0
The chicken with mustard sauce ( Carolina Gold ) is super tasty . We recommend that you branch out and give it a try .<->1
Service was good , they put the game we wanted on screen , however the food was n't great . It 's like the wings had been sitting under a heat lamp for a while .<->2
Their coffee is unbelievable , it takes a little longer than your average coffee shop but it 's worth it . Make sure you get the Brazilian pour over it 'll blow your mind .<->1
I recently went Doce Taqueria for take out . The tacos were good and reasonably priced .<->1
Unfortunately they have removed the oysters from the menu and now the ceviche and crab cakes from the happy hour menu . Flies all over food on patio .<->2
We brought a growler in to be filled and the bartender did n't tighten the cap and used masking tape to seal it .<->2
Wonderful authentic Moroccan food and the owner was so attentive . Chicken kabob was great and the home made sauces were fantastic .<->1
Pizza was great and the slices are huge but thin . Beer is normal price . Interior is creative . Cheese bread was not great . Place stays open until 5 am . Worth a visit and the people that were working were very nice .<->1
Almost perfect but for the mounted wall speakers spewing out everything but blissful silence .<->2
Had the Madonna mango smoothie ... sooo good !<->1
Such a great place . I have been there twice . Excellent both times . Great service and great food . It 's mouth watering . We ca n't wait to go back .<->1
Great tasting food with good service . Only set back is the pricing . It 's cheaper to buy a fully loaded bagel .<->1
We really enjoyed this spot . The industrial decor is really neat , the service was friendly and the food was incredibly flavorful . Fresh and interesting flavor combinations really stood out as original and memorable ! I would highly recommend a visit !<->1
It 's a little hole in the wall place . The hamburger buns are the best I have ever had . They have a wall full of bottled sodas to choose from . The food is great .<->1
This is the worst service that I have ever had period ... Beers are cold and good , ordered food almost an hour ago really , I have not even got my Salad OMG ! ! ! Never recommend some one to come eat for free<->0
Great food , friendly staff , good size portions and quick efficient service . My recommendation for anyone wanting a tasty sandwich .<->1

If you go here for the sushi bar expect to pay around $ 90 - 100 for 4 rolls for two people . They have great customer service , clean restaurant and great sushi !<->1
I only use the drive thru so far , but the service and food is amazing . Quiche Lorraine is soo yummy ! Also order the ham and cheese croissants , out of this world !<->1
Best Italian style pizza in town . I eat here at least once a month when the pizza craving hits and you want a delicious one .<->1

Great selection of fresh fish + amazing fish tacos and the best fish & chips I 've ever had + super friendly staff .<->1
Friendly staff and great cinnamon rolls . You can order 1 mini for $ 2 if you do n't feel like crying yourself to sleep after eating a regular sized one ! Candy coated nuts tasted great too .<->1
Great burgers . Greats beers . Who could ask for more ? Just had the black and blue burger and it was just as good as last year . So happy we found this place .<->1
Went to the cafe on the last morning of our stay for breakfast . The service and food were wonderful . The crab Benedict was worth every penny .<->1
Seating was atrocious . Poor setup . Chips were stale . Salas were good .. tacos were mushy . Pork belly was not crispy . Nice looking little place but would not recommend .<->0
I 've been going here for over two years now , and even though the service is n't five stars the food is !<->1
They have refilled everything , I ha e been in three more times and each time the carrots and radishes are fresh and filled and they were cleaning .<->1
The Chana masala is fantastic . If you like spicy food - go for it ! They served me a true 7/10 heat level . Most places do n't . The tamarind chutney with the samosas is also a must have !<->1
Very fun place to shop . They have a great deli and great staff that are always very helpful . The produce is also amazing . Great prices<->1
There was something black floating in the water . Floor had crayons and food all over throughout the restaurant . Waiter was friendly but seemed half asleep . Wo n't be back .<->0
Very messy but VERY good . We had the shrimp and king crab legs and I highly recommend both !<->1
Best most authentic Italian around , and I 'm a picky NYer . Great food , but book ahead or the waits can be long .<->1

I really want to love this spot , however they struggled to get my order right a couple days in a row . The flavor of the coffee is good but service not so much ...<->2
Nice casual off the Aria Casino / Lobby - - away from the frenzy . Very friendly wait staff , delightful Cobb salad at lunch .<->2
Amazing spot to eat ! very clean and relaxing environment with very delicious food ! their salmon dish is to die for ! and fried spinach salad ! If you have n't gone you , you must ! and you 'll be a returning customer thereafter , guaranteed !<->1
My favorite place in Pittsburgh guys . If you did n't try before you can try that ! Especially soup and kebabs !<->1
We are usually satisfies with the food here , but yesterday night we ordered chicken in hot garlic sauce which was horrible .. what came out totally different .. it chicken in some kind of v tangy sauce .. close to buffalo sauce .<->0
New managment sent the place from a nice gastropub to a PT 's / Denny 's style cheap eatery . Laminated menus , plastic cups , cheap food . So sad , this place was a nice place for locals .<->0
This is my favorite cafe in Las Vegas . Coffee fabulous ! Bread magnificent ! Anyone who has negative things to say about this place is totally tasteless . The ambience is sweet and the service is amazing .<->1

Great pizza per slice or as whole . Worth the adventure of looking for it . New york style slices with excellent crust , grease , cheese and toppings . Clue is third floor above Marquee .<->1
This is one of my favorite game day spots ! Great food , great beer selection , great crowd and you can see your game on where ever you sit . The only thing it is lacking is better ( more positive & friendly ) service .<->1
Stopped in for lunch . Had the chopped salad . Awesome ! ! Can not say enough about this place ! Beautiful restaurant and excellent service ! Will see you again soon !<->1
One of the best Thai Food places I 've had in Vegas . Consistent . Spicy . Fast delivery and everybody is always very nice on the phone .<->1
The food is delicious . Definitely going back again . Loved the service and quiet atmosphere .<->1
Food is not very good . Even the sushi is not great . Some of the grocery stores make better Sushi . I do n't get my money 's worth because there is n't much that is very good .<->0
The kang gai soup has been scientifically proven to cure all ailments including heartbreak . The Squash curry is pretty much the secret to all my successful romantic relationships .<->1
Got ta downgrade my original love of Maya . Prices and quality and service . Waited for several more visits to make sure it was n't a bad day and it 's true .<->2
Excellent pizza ! So light and crispy with fresh ingredients ! The Caesar salad was fantastic as well ! Best pizza I 've had in a while !<->1
Loved my shake and tea ! Looking forward to my next one ! They were friendly and informative ... great tasting too !<->1

Taylor ham , egg and cheese on an everything bagle toasted followed by 18 holes at desert canyon ... Amazing<->1
Great place to grab a frosty pint with amazing views behind the bar and behind your seat . Head up to the top level bar for views of the strip . Enjoy .<->1
It 's 108 degrees outside but I do n't mind having their ohh sooo good authentic pho . Delicious food , friendly service and reasonable price . I almost forgot to complement their freshly brewed thai tea .. sooo good<->1
customer service is horrible and there sushi was so dry.roe fish that dry will be you can get sick . wo n't recommend anyone for here and wo n't go back ! !<->0
Messed up my online order ( missing ingredients ) , absolutely RUDE AND UNPROFESSIONAL when I contacted them about it . Made me feel like they were " too busy with the holiday rush " to even entertain fixing the problem , excuse after excuse . NOT RECOMMENDED !<->0
Love me some papa johns , Delivery service is relatively slow but pizza always delivers .<->2
Fries were not good . Burger was charred on the outside , dry inside . Good apps : wings and onion rings . Great service .<->0
Very fun evening spot . Brunch is also great . Short rib Benedict was delicious . Unlimited mimosas . Be sure to take UBER<->1
LOVE . Good service . Staff is generally friendly and smile . Enjoy the environment . I like the evenings with bruschetta and wine . I also like brunch . It 's all good !<->1

Super pumped to find a place with a good selection of craft beer and knowledgeable staff to talk with about beer .<->1
This is the best Harris Teeter around . There is never anyone here . I love it . Plenty of parking . They have a better selection compared to most markets . Even have a Starbucks in the store .<->1
Every single thing that I 've ordered is beyond delicious . Service is always wonderful , too !<->1
Go during football games . The pints and food options are priced appropriately for what is offered .<->2
12 - Strawberries Covered in Semisweet Chocolate - very yummy and we got Groupon certificate for $ 12 . Service was very friendly and helpful .<->1
Honestly , the best flat white I think I ever drank ! Ckean and bright setting . Friendly staff . Awesome !<->1
The macarons rivaled those we had Ladurée on the Champs - Élysée in Paris . These are that good , and certainly worth a stop when you are at the West Side Market .<->1
Solid choice for something quick , fresh and relatively healthy . They are always fast - a short lunch hour has never been an issue here . My favorite is getting a panini with their tomato soup to dip it in !<->1
We had the Cuban and Crispy Chicken sandwiches . Both we were wonderful . The bread pudding did not disappoint ! The staff were super friendly !<->1
I love this place ! So many options on tea and spices . The owner is always so helpful and giving . If you love to cook , this place has a great selection of spices and rubs .<->1
Love this place , they have the best sandwiches around . Definitely recommend the Cairo , delicious every time .<->1
A little pricy for my taste . I recommend this place for their sandwiches . An expensive sandwich at $ 9 , but you wo n't regret it .<->2
Last Night was the coldest night in the season I am on my way home from works . When I stopby Viet Noodle Bar to Try Bun Bo Hue , it was the Best Bun Bo Hue In town ... Good Job guys ..<->1

Really good pizza with fresh ingredients . I highly recommend this new local business .<->1
Awesome food and service . Their shredded beef tacos were delicious . We also had the cheese crisp and it was very good . Loved the bean dip they served with the chips and salsa .<->1
Great pizza ! ! ! We order through the GrubHub app or pick up . The Capprese pizza is just wonderful . Fresh tomato slices with pesto and cheese , just wonderful . Great portions and prices . These guys know what they 're doing .<->1
Great prices on drinks . Chips and salsa on the house ! Would highly recommend this place for reasonable drinking . The sangria was fabulous ( white was the best ) . Excellent service .<->1
Had the Sunday Buffett little bit of everything they offer . Excellent food . I tried almost all local Charlotte Indian places and this is by far the tastiest Indian place in my opinion .<->1
Best place to take a date in Tempe , chill hipster bar , solid kitchen , packed on the weekends , can smoke outside is a big plus , try the lighter side with blackened chicken<->1
Saying goodbye to our facorite restaurant . Amano 's closes next week . We will miss this place . The food and wine never disappoint .<->1
Booby Q 's baby back ribs are always prefect , very tender and the favor is the best ! The ambiance is quite nice as well . The staff are always attentive and friendly !<->1
Great meal . Steak , pizza special , potato skins all excellent . Mark was a great host . Looking forward to going back .<->1
Fantastic food . It 's damn good . Delicious everything , it always has a long wait but SO worth it<->1
We go here for office lunches for the buffet . It is quick and as far as buffets go it is n't bad . I have had better Italian food but for the price and convenience it 's hard to beat !<->1
Food is great ! The desserts were alright but that worked it because I could do without the sugar .<->1
Great service and good food been going there for years . Portions are huge ca n't beat the price . It 's not fast food it 's not high end its in between .<->1
They do not disappoint ! Christmas roll , Parma balls . Amazing ! ! ! There 's a reason they have such great reviews ! ! !<->1
Fettuccini Casanova was so gooooodddd ! ! ! I could n't stop eating it :) service was great ! Bread should be serve hotter tho . Our server Omar was good :)<->1
Only come for the peking duck , because the rest is passable . Do n't expect good service , the place is old and reeks . If you want high quality peking duck , go across the street at the Brilliant Restaurant .<->2
A very popular place . You need to make reservations ahead of time . It 's hard to call them . You are better off with dropping by a few days ahead to make reservations . Best Thai food yet in town !<->1
Sway is the man ! Great food and great service ! Management was spectacular and so good to my friends and I who were here for a bachelorette party . Bottomless mimosas were actually bottomless . We had a blast ! ! ! Brunch<->1
A hidden gem for sure ! As a sushi fanatic , I can confidently say they are one of the best sushi spots in town .<->1
I love window food . Jimmy Jack 's is on point . Their cheeseburger reminds me of the ones I used to get from another window in high school . I will be back<->1
Fiesta Mexicana makes the BEST tortas and a lot of great authentic mexican food . Literally when I started eating my torta , I could n't stop , it was just tooo good .<->1
All foods are delicious and authentic , like oden , oxy tongue , beef tataki , the pork feet , tofu soup ! ! desserts are great too !<->1
Love this restaurant ! Great food & drink list ! ! Please update your drink menu on here ! I had the " Yes Precious " drink & I 'd love to see what 's in it again ! ! !<->1
Something has changed at this place . Service has dropped and pricing raised . Very sad as I have been coming here for 15 years and was at one point my favorite restaurant . I hope they fix it .<->2
Without a doubt the most interesting sushi bar with the freshest fish in Vegas . Never miss a chance to come here when in town .<->1
Just ate here for the first time while in town for work . Our server Alberto was great as was the food . Highly recommended spot ! Great atmosphere too !<->1
While it 's nice to see a grocery store like this it is not for it to be overpriced and having it offering baguettes aged to be as hard as broom stick .<->2
Very good food , amazing lamb , huge portions ! Definite must .<->1
What great service from the minute you walk in to the restaurant till you leave . Has a great home feel to it . Food was awesome<->1
Alex is the nicest chef in town ! The food is great value and the atmosphere is best . One hint : go on a cold night , the dining area is always very warm .<->1
It was awesome ! Christopher is the best server ever . Knows the menu well . He recommended all the best items . Do yourself a favor and go here now ! Dooo it ! Now !<->1
Zero stars this place has no costermer service they close 20 min early saying there cashiers need to go homeSorry i do n't get to do that at my job<->0
Really tasty authentic hot food you wo n't be disappointed , with no real decor or ambience , price is not really nominal for dinner ... very friendly service give it a try<->1
Pretty good food and I love that they used recycled paper products ( bowls and plates ) . I had the gluten free waffle and it was really good .<->1
We were excited based off of the shows he does , but the service was super scatter brained and slow , and the food was inedible . Salsa was amazing though .<->0
Never like barbecue until I moved down south and this place is one of the best in town ! Pulled pork sandwich is always a go - to ! And the biscuits are phenomenal<->1
That 's the nastiest crap ever . I wanted a taco salad . I do n't know what I got but it sure was n't a salad .<->0
Un peu desappointé par la pizza de la semaine de la pizza : 1 ) elle est au menu 2 ) elle est au prix du menu et est somme toute assez ordinaire .<->2
outstanding dinner ! ! ! I had the veal and my husband had the seafood platter with pasta ! ! ! OUTSTANDING food and waiter.cannot wait to come back :)<->1
One of the best options in Old town . They grilled octopus is a most . I had been there a few times and they always have the best service .<->1
Plenty of parking space and waiting room which is much needed since you 're going to be waiting 45 minutes . Service is average , not good . Pizza was great and prices were on the higher side .<->1
Great atmosphere and service . The food and drinks are very well made and delicious . Be prepare for the high prices .<->1
We are not vegan / veg people and like our meat , but were able to walk out happy . Love how clean their food is . Makes me feel like I made a wise choice .<->1
If you like Mexican food this is the place , good food , good prices , there beef burritos are really good .<->1
The service was slow and our waitress unattentive . The manager did n't seem to want repeat business . The food was n't anything particularly special either . There are much better choices .<->0
Best Mexican around . Pleased every time I go . Great prices , friendly staff , and great atmosphere . A must visit if you 're in town .<->1
Terrible food appalling customer service order delivery if you want to be harassed by the delivery driver just ridiculous<->0
Best quality meat in city . Grocery stores including AJ ' s do not compare . They get there beef from only two places In the country . Saratoga steak is amazing . Butchers are knowledgeable and extremely helpful .<->1
Best Cuban sandwich I have ever tasted . Draft beer selection is second to none . Great staff and atmosphere . We ate at the bar and our interaction with the bartenders made the night .<->1
Friendly service and really amazing talent in the kitchen . My weakness is for their big chocolate chip cookies ( chip is an understatement ) and the locally - made chocolate at the counter .<->1
Bomb af but snobby waiters they literally act like they ca n't wait to turn your table lol<->1
Meh , it was okay . Not the best food ever but not terrible<->0
Just moved to the area . Been through the drive thru twice . Extremely slow , long lines . Could use an update . Workers are friendly .<->0
Wonderful ice cream sandwich after a day at the aquarium . Staff was incredibly nice and welcoming !<->1
The food is great here ! This is by far the best experience I 've had at a Korean BBQ restaurant . One problem was the quickness of the food getting to the table . Otherwise I would go here again .<->1
extremely rude . No service . Ignored .. treated poorly . Not a large selection of food .<->0
Very very friendly staff . Feels like you re at home . If you went in your pajamas , they would prob serve you cuz they re that nice . The food is also good . I recommend the beef lasagna and baked fish<->1
Come by a few times and have n't been disappointed . Beer , pretzel and burger ... what more can you ask for .<->1
Bon mais prix élevé pour une Poutine . Par contre , grosse portion et plusieurs sélections de Poutine .<->2
Good service and good decor . But the food is too salty and too sour . Not a good Japanese restaurant .<->0
Love this place ! The decor is Tuscan and beautiful . Best lobster bisque ever ! ! ! Warm and tasty bread basket accompanies the meal with delicious sourdough bread . Ca nt wait to get back here for happy hour soon .<->1
Great beer and good food . I enjoy coming here even though it used to be a Home Town Buffet<->1
Been here for about 15 mins . And at least they can do is give me my drinks . Good thing the food is good and worth the wait .<->2
Fresh / Great Menu / nice place for a quick workday lunch . They specialize in burgers but I 'm a fan of the watermelon salad and chicken tacos . Only complaint - Pepsi no Coke .<->1
Well worth the wait ! Try to go early if you can because they get really busy ! Smoked meat sandwich is amazing ! So amazing that once you try it you 'll never be the same ... yes it 's that great !<->1
The food I thought was not bad , pretty pricey . And after I heard they had a mouse sighting ... Do n't think you should be eating and I know I wo n't be eating there anymore .<->2
I think the place is shut down , conveniently just before the expiry of their groupon ! Have been trying to call them repeated but no one answers the phone . SCAMMERS !<->0
Freshly made while you wait . Grilled on a grill . Watching them prepare it was interesting . Very filling and delicious .<->1
Great pizza ! Some of , if not the the best in the valley . I love the slightly sweet but still tangy sauce . We will definitely be back !<->1
Great food , great service ! We had the pork belly benedict and the chiliquiles ... both outstanding . Antonio , the chef / owner , came over to introduce himself ... not only talented , but a nice guy ! We will be back ... often !<->1
only go between 2 - 5 pm mon - frithe happy is the best deals around 4.50 margarita giant 1.50 tacos and taco bartypical bill is 8 - 9 $ - perfect lunch at work opportunity<->1
Great food and service . SUPER disappointed they RAISED PRICES . That is a HUGE increase in this market . Sorry guys , we live in the neighborhood but now you are too expensive to visit as often as we were .<->2
Omg ! ! ! Maggots on the sushi . Health department needs to inspect this place . Restrooms is so dirty even the curtains going to hallway is so nasty stained .<->0
very simple and friendly place , the indian bread was different and good . staff was very friendly and recommended some good choices , nice gift store inside .<->1
If you order anything more than appetizers and expect a quality meal , you 'll be somewhat let down ..<->0
Great food . Friendly service . Location might make it hard to find , but it is close to Sahara and Ft . Apache .<->1
Food tastes very good here but a bit pricy . Partly because they target office worker form liberty village .<->2
LOVE this place ! ! ! But so sad that they close down so early in the year . It 's still flippen HOT out ! ! ! PLEASE reopen !<->1
2nd time there both with a big group . Cool place , huge selection of beers , but the food is only so - so . Asada taco was tasty , but both carnitas and chorizo tacos were bad .<->2
Excellent service , authentic Italian . Had the Chicken Sinatra and it was fantastic . Tiramisu was also fantastic !<->1
Holy yum ! Small selection but all the cookies are great . High prices but worth it . You will not be disappointed at all<->1
It 's not a NY / NJ bagel but a good option if you 're in the area . Good egg sandwiches and a nice unique selection of cream cheese ( schmears ) .<->1
Addicted to the BLT but on wheat . Next will try the unwich . Always super scrumptious and love the pickles ! Nom ! Nom ! Nom ! Not sharing . : 0 )<->1
Best ice cream in Pittsburgh ! I love every single thing I 've ever gotten here . I especially recommend the Raspberry Almond Torte Sundae and the Yinzer sundae ... YUM ! Support your local family - owned businesses !<->1
The best bagels I ever tried great costumer service and very clean they just earned a regular costumer for life ! !<->1
Absolutely pathetic service , the clerks ca n't even speak English and take my order properly . It took 20 minutes to get a sesame bagel with cream cheese then when I got it , it was cold .<->0
Service has gotten considerably better the past few visits . Now worth visiting .<->2
Unique ! Got ta have corn - on - the - cob . Interesting tacos -- Peking Duck ?<->1
Love this restaurant ! Excellent food and service All The Time ! The spaghetti and meatballs are the best ever . Reasonable prices and great atmosphere . My favorite restaurant on the strip .<->1
Best chocolate mocha I have had . Great service by the Hollywood Brunette .<->1
The food is very plain with no flavor at all . The meat and the guac . Normally we love chipotle but not this location . The staff are decent . Said welcome and what not<->2
Excellent food and excellent service . We ended up paying over $ 800 for four people , but it was totally worth it . Their specialty steaks are delicious and just melt in your mouth<->1
Went for Sunday Brunch ! Since they have a scratch kitchen I asked for scramble eggs with chicken sausage add in and I had an order of pumpkin pancakes with a sangria ! Everything was delicious ! Pancakes were light and fluffy ! !<->1
Look forward to coming back to this amazing not to mention yummy in your tummy spot ! Not only is it tasty the staff if friendly too just wish they had a larger sitting area at times :)<->1
Living in a remote area in Arizona , roaming these aisles and seeing the loads of seafood and meats felt like pure luxury . My go to place for stocking up on Korean goodies and produce when in Vegas !<->1
Best place in the world to gather with friends . Have never found better wings anywhere and we have looked everywhere around the country . Sometimes we crave their Reuben sandwich .<->1
I want to give Lo - Lo 's 5 stars only because i could not give them 10 best dinning experience i have had in vegas . Shannon our waitress was really full of spunk very helpful , very kind . Great Establishment ! !<->1
Love this place . The service can come across a little unfriendly sometimes but the food and smoothies are creative , delicious , and make you feel good about what you 're putting into your body<->1
Worst steaks I have ever bought . I purchased the filets and rib eyes and they taste awful and are very tough . Throwing the damn meat away .<->0
Very good barbecue . Too bad it was pork instead of beef . Would recommend it though . Very friendly people , as is the norm in this part of the country .<->1
Still sick and suffering ! ! We knew we where going to be sick right after we left . My family spent the last 48 hours in turmoil - - we will not be back .<->0
The food and services were top notch ! ! The prime rib was fantastic , trout was fresh and the skirt steak was definitely Chicago style ! !<->1
The employees here always give TOP NOTCH customer service . They are always so sweet and accommodating ! ! I 've been here several times and each employee has always been great ! My favorite port of subs location BY FAR . :)<->1
Delicious little hole in the wall ! ! ! We 're from CA and was out here visiting family ... we will MOST DEFINITELY be back next visit ! ! Had pulled pork , pulled brisket and a hamburger , everything was amazing . The hush puppies ... BEST we 've had ! ! !<->1
We wanted to grab lunch before heading to the airport , and La Santisima was the perfect place . The salsa bar provided many tasty options to add to our already delicious lunch . Highly recommend !<->1
Pork tenderloin was incredible , especially the cream corn base . I would also recommend the meatballs and apple crostata .<->1
Their brunch was so good ! ! ! I love the industrial look of the restaurant . The biscuits and gravy was delicious . I 'm not a seafood fan so I ca n't attest to their oysters . Highly recommend !<->1
Ordered Pasta Positano with extra basil , which was excellent . I love how clean the restaurant is and the professionalism of staff most especially the male host .<->1
While the pho broth was a little bland ( still delicious ) , the ramen was excellent ! Quick service , nice waitresses . Only downside is the lack of ( working ) TVs .<->1
The food was amazing . It was my first visit and I will make it a point to return . The service was outstanding . The buffet offered at lunch had a huge variety to choose from .<->1
The ambiance is okay , prices are a little high for what they offer . Service is polite and food is tasty . Probably will not be back .<->2
Pizza is yummy & service is outstanding , & the prices are even better will be back soon .<->1
What a delightful place . The food was delicious especially the panini and the coffee The owner made us feel like long lost friends . We felt like we were in Europe<->1
I died and went to scone heaven . I may never go to Amelie 's again . This place is uh - mazing<->1
We ate there twice during our 4 days in Vegas . my daughter likes the clam chowder soup .<->1
Best and cheap chicken shawarma around square 1 area . Very welcoming and humble owner . Must visit place , i go there for lunch often .<->1
Service today he was friendly crisp and efficient . I had biscuits gravy bacon and eggs ; it was a great breakfast . My wife had the pumpkin pancakes .<->1
Great chicken burritos and love that roasted ( black - looking ) salsa !<->1
Great French Dip an the fiancé 's pastrami was really good too . The guy taking our order was slow but the food was SO GOOD ! will be back !<->1
Good food , horrible service . Ate here for years , but staff and management have really gone downhill . I 'm done with this place .<->0
The food was greasy , the service was nothing special , and the drinks were blah . I would n't recommend them , but their happy hour is reasonable .<->2
Overall this place is ok . I might order out form here but very unlikely . It 's a bit over priced for the portion . But The food is just so darn good ! Test Review<->1
The best greens and beans in town . This place is cozy and friendly . The food is always amazing and it is BYOB !<->1
Had takeout from here the other day . Camerones rancheros were awesome and flavorful . Everyone else loved their food . Would recommend .<->1
Ordered edamame , gyoza and some rolls to go . Service was fast but when I got home , turns out the gyoza and edamame were undercooked .<->2
I came in to eat one afternoon and the woman who works there was so rude and rushed us to decide even when there was n't any customers .<->0
CLOSED . Commander 's Palace is currently closed , trying to find a new location . Let 's hope it reopens soon .<->1
Terrible . The worst I 've ever had . The food was bland , overpriced , my hot meal came out cold .<->0
Great noodles ! Very good flavour and spicy and not salty . A large portion with lots of noodles and pork belly . Will defintely be full . A Hidden gem ! ! Must try !<->1
Ordered a black tea macchiato with regular sugar no ice but got one with no sugar . The service was horrible too ... did n't get vicinity points for sales items and two downtown locations both do<->2
this place is across the street from where i get my hair done . The sandwiches are ok . I have had better but sometime when you are hungry you have to eat what you can .<->2
If you want AYCE Korean BBQ on the cheap this is the spot . Expect to wait for a table but its worth it , I LOVE the salad .<->1
I love the Salmon Bowl , a great choice for those who love raw salmon , and the Katsu bowl is great for kids or those who are shy about Asian food .<->1
Great environment , delicious beer ! Belgium Dubbel on draft , great choice . Comfortable seating , food truck and plenty of servers . Might become my new favorite spot ! !<->1
Lengthy menu , large selection of vegetarian dishes . Great flavors .<->1
Nice casual place to have good margaritas . Food is good too . House margaritas not so good however cw margaritas are great !<->1
love this place , the food is extraordinary ! ! !<->1
Wife and I saw good reviews on this restaurant and decided to give it a shot . Very friendly service . Very good prices . Very good food . Recommend for anyone in the area .<->1
A great meal - started with the bone marrow , enjoyed the pork chop and flat iron . Everything was perfectly seasoned and the root to berries cocktail was delicious ! Definitely worth a wait .<->1
They have some of the best wings in Pittsburgh ! They offer breakfast , burgers , fried chicken , rotisserie chicken , fish , sandwiches and shrimp . They are open : Monday - Friday 7 am - 6pmSaturday7am - 4pmCheck out their website : www.georgeaikens.com<->1
Awesome smashed avacado toast with an egg over easy . Delicious ! ! ! Tea of the day was creamsicle . I had it ice , yum ! ! ! Will definitely be back .<->1
The Lobster Ravioli was to die for ! Literally dead . My cold dead fingers are typing this review . Two rigamortis thumbs up .<->1
One of my favorite places to go if i want a banh mi ! its super good and cheap , they offer a lot of choices , a selection of bbtea and boxed sushi<->1
Huge servings and the best food . Been going here for years and I can say that this is one of the hidden gems in Calgary ! The owners are so nice too<->1
It 's a actually relaxing place to come and have a lunch sub and just enjoy the great food they have . Very nicely done honestly<->1
Good chocolates , great selection in their tiny store . Prices are much cheaper than Malleys !<->1
Literally my favorite secret ( now not so secret ) dessert spot . The honey toast with strawberries and ice cream and nutella is jist off the chain .<->1
Poor quality fish , small quantity . Made me wish I had picked up sushi at the Whole Foods or Frys instead - where it is vastly better . Even with the happy hour prices that fish is overpriced .<->0
Top golf is great . Michelle ( managerfrom Boston ) is awesome . She made EVERYONE in the group feel welcome . Misa was the waitress and she was great . I will be coming back soonPAM<->1
This place is great ! Everybody should try it . I got a gyro and it was the best that I 've ever had . The service was top notch !<->1
I like Chinese food ! The Waiter was patient and friendly , what 's more , the dishes are so delicious . My friend ordered a piece of Set meal named Phoenix with me . Wonderful !<->1
Nice atmosphere . Great menu . New England clam chowder is superb and the best fish tacos I 've ever had . Mel and John are great bartenders and Ty provides great service . Ask John any rock and roll question .<->1
The worst kimchi tofu soup I 've ever had ! I am surprise I even give a 1 star ... I guess it 's for the service ... never going back !<->0
Just ate a Rudy 's in Chandler . Best BarbQ ever ! Linda K<->1
Great food ... great service and great drinks . Sat at the bar and had dinner . DJ played great music but was n't too loud . Seafood was amazing . Defintely coming back .<->1
Overall , I find this restaurant a mixed - bag and I rarely think of going here for lunch . The service is spotty to mediocre ... and sometimes rude . The menu is uninspired and decidedly old - school vegetarian . Nothing new here . Meh .<->0
Got takeout tonight and the food was really good ! Not greasy and the flavour was spot on . Will definitely order from there again !<->1
Sushi is good but skip their poké bol , sadly not many ingredients besides 3/4 of rice on the bol :/<->2
Went here during the summer ! I recommend getting the pad se ew , pad thai , and yellow curry . The service was fast and the price is very reasonable . Would go there again if I have a chance !<->1
Sucks . Not fresh . ! ! . not Japanese style at all . super Slow ! ! Waitress are like sleeping .. chefs are playing ...<->0
Great food , great service ! The nilaga and boneless bangus is so good ! Staff are very friendly especially Mirasol , she gave us recommendations of what 's good to order . Thank you Max !<->1
Hands down the best pizza in town ! ! ! Fantastic pizzas , quick service and very friendly staff !<->1
We finally went back and the waitress actually remembered us and the events of our earlier meal there ! Needless to say , we had pizza and it was perfect . I expect we will go back again .<->1
New Mexican is a good place to eat . Standard food at good prices . There are better places for Mexican in the area , but one is far off and one is three times the price . Worth a try .<->2
Workers are sweet and parking is VERY limited . Only 3 parking spaces for non handicap . But besides that very nice location<->1
Maybe the nicest people and the nicest family - owned restaurant I 've been to in a long time . And the Philly cheese steak is excellent , too !<->1
its a nice place for breakfast . the hamburger i ordered was very tasty.unfortunately my family did n't like much the food they ordered . Waitress did good job to serve us !<->1
Service was horrible and the food was bad and I did n't even get what I asked .. I do n't recommend this place at all .<->0
Awesome food , no skimping on the meat , and wonderful staff . I had the Godfather , and it was delicious . Had one of the cookies too , also fantastic . No issues with the Sanitary conditions of this location , appeared to be very clean .<->1
One of my favorite Chinese places in Charlotte ! Well priced , always fast and convienant . Fresh and tasty , does not disappoint , consistent<->1
Regular 50 ' s diner . The food is good and the service is usually good . Small place . Only neg is if your in a wheelchair - you 're sitting outside .<->1
i took my mom and sister here over Memorial Day weekend ! They loved it just as much as I did !<->1
Great place with great food . I have tried most of the menu and have yet to find something I do n't like . Robin , my waitress , is always friendly and attentive to our needs .<->1
Great service , pretty lenient on time limit when it 's not busy , and also offers all you can drink . Not too many fancy rolls but definitely a great place to go if you 're going for all you can eat !<->1
Amazing place ! had the rabbit & crackers , beet salad , trout + scallops ... reminded me of one of my favorite places in Atlanta ( Canoe ) ! Definitely recommend , well worth the money ! Not very expensive , really , for the quality of food !<->1
Do n't go to this restaurant on a full stomach . All the food is a la carte . It 's great food . Good service . Must go .<->1
Best Mousaka this side of Astoria . Lovely hard working , husband and wife owners . If you are craving Greek food in Henderson / Las Vegas , this is the place ! Home made Baklava was also excelkent<->1
Best Thai food ever . Staff is always friendly and on point . Food is always great . Price is very reasonable for what you are getting . I highly recommend Archi 's .<->1
Was brought here by my cousin . It was St . Patrick 's Day so it was n't crowded . The food was outstanding , the staff were very friendly ... definitely hope to return when in the area .<->1
Food was pretty good for the $ 8.99 steak special . The service was slow . If you 're not in a rush , I 'd recommend it .<->1
Some frds from America recommended it to me . I ordered less salt noodle , but it is still tooooo salty . The bamboo shoots taste spoiled , and made me have loose bowels .<->2
So good ! Ca n't go wrong with Fired Pie . Ingredients are always fresh with plenty of options . I really like their gluten free crust . I 've always had great service .<->1
Absolutely delicious ! Try the queso bean dip ! I wish this place was closer to me so I could go all the time ... definitely go here for a casual lunch while you 're in Vegas ! !<->1
food awful , very spicy , waitress did nt speak english . ordered dish made me choke . they made me pay for it . stay away do nt go here . i will tell many , many people . bad food , bad service , may 22 , 2015 .<->0
Food is good , salads are phenomenal , but the pricing is way out of control . If they cut their prices in half , I would be a regular here .<->2
Very good burnt ends . It 's a little trendy yes and it is a bit pricey but the food is worth it . Try going on a weekday as the weekends can be a bit chaotic .<->1
Food was ok but was a bit too pricey Denny 's is better you get more for your money and much tastier also we ordered a side of pancakes which the waitress forgot to bring :(<->0
Called 13 times just to place our order ! When we got home only had half the order and now they wo n't answer the phone to get a darn refund<->0
Staff is friendly , great beer list , creative menu , and the owner really cares about the quality and experience you have .<->1
Sans doute la meilleure boulangerie de Las Vegas ;) Je vous conseille les pains au chocolat , le mille - feuille et les crêpes !<->1
This restaurant leaves a lot to be desired when they only have one cashier jumping between the counter and the drive throw . Not a positive experience . To bad because I like KFC but this restaurants needs major help .<->0
Packed always but worth the wait . Lengua and asada always on point . Great meal whenever you want great tacos .<->1
Terrific sandwiches , a great place to stop by on the way home or to work . Definitely my favorite deli in Tempe !<->1
One of the best hibachi and sushi I 've ever had in Pittsburgh . They have other locations too . Perfect place to take a family to with fun hibachi shows .<->1
I ordered pad see eew . It was good and extremely hot / fresh . Maybe future visits to try some curry ...<->1
Every time I come here I leave happy . Excellent food , and lighting fast service ! Miso soup is delish and you can also order half salads If you have a small appetite .<->1
A true and unique French restaurant in Las Vegas . The food was excellent and the manager / owner is super friendly . You can finally enjoy real French food at an affordable price .<->1
Such a cool vibe in this lush coffee shop . So much greenery , could hardly contain myself . Ordered the Iced Lavender Latte and loved it ! I love ! ! ! Atmosphere - 5/5 Coffee - 5/5 Customer Service - 5/5<->1
Food . Good good food . Carne Asada pizza , excellent .<->1
Very nice inside , the sound system is really bad though . and the crowd there that night looked to be trying out for the jersey shore or tool academy . meat market if that 's what you want ...<->2
This is great little gem . The owners / staff are super friendly and the food is fantastic . The only problem is that I live far away ! If it were closer I would come here all the time .<->1
I love this place ! ! ! Such great ingrients and a wonderful happy hour ! I come here pretty regularly . I always go with steak and shrimp . $ 1 domestic beers all day everyday ! Who can beat that ? # YUM<->1
It 's a really cozy place with amazing food . The people in the restaurant is great and we really enjoyed our time there ! A must go for a cool brunch !<->1
Un des pires rapport qualité / quantité / prix que j'ai vu dans un restaurant à Montréal . Cherchez ailleurs vous trouverez mieux . J'ai mis 3 étoiles au liez de une , car la nourriture demeure excellente .<->2
I love coming here to get great Thai food . They have a lot to choose from and they have great prices .<->1
Great food and great service ! ! ! Highly recommended best food in monroeville I ever tried !<->1
Love this place . Prices are super low , it 's clean , has friendly service and yummy dishes ! Do n't let the area it 's in fool you . It 's worth it ! Just ordered 4 main dishes and an appetizer for $ 30 !<->1
Love the decor and the super fast wi - fi . The coffee is great and the tuna wraps are yummy , too !<->1
The Sunday brunch is amazing . I completely recommend the French toast if you ca n't decide .<->1
This restaurant has some of the best Indian in town . Their samosas are obviously homemade , and their chicken tikka is so good . My husband loves the hot vindaloo , with chicken . We take out from here all the time !<->1
Best customer service experience . They have the best breakfast burrito in Vegas . If you all are looking for a quick bite i would definitely recommend you check this place out . You wo nt be disappointed ! !<->1
I had a burger and poutine here once I will never go back . One word of advice save your money lol<->0
A good choice at the Phoenix airport . Fajitas were very good for airport food and service was quick and friendly . Way better than La Madeline .<->1
The grocery is clean and have all kinds of things that normally ca n't be find at other asian grocery . Got 10 % discount on every purchase .<->1
Been coming to Islands at Desert Ridge for years since they opened . I really enjoy the atmosphere , service and great food .<->1
Food was okay . A little on the bland side if you ask me . Service was okay also . Way too pricey for what you 're getting .<->0
It says its open until midnight but this place always closes earlier . Got here at 11:50 . No one at the intercom .<->0
THis is a new location , has n't been open very long . Def got ta go . The servers and staff were all very nice and the food was great !<->1
Took my family and meat selection was fantastic . The owner and his wife were very warm and accompanying ! Will definitely got back ! ! !<->1
I 'm addicted there breakfast is delicious , lunch and dinner Five Star for me , would recommend anyone to try this place out .. friendly staff and environment as well .. I come here a couple times a week ;)<->1
The sushi here is super fresh and reasonably priced for the quality . Highly recommend the chirashi don . I think I just found my new favorite sushi place in the yonge / Sheppard area ! !<->1
Die Pizza war sehr gut . Die Nudeln waren Durchschnitt . Der Parkplatz ist nicht so gut . Viel zu eng . Auf alle Fälle muss man reservieren ! Zum Pizzaessen gehe ich wieder hin .<->1
I eat here once approximately every other month , always happy with the experience . It can be busy at times and have to wait but the food is good and the places philosophy and community engagement is wonderful .<->1
First time to this location . Clean area , good food and great service ! ! The manager was great and helpful ! We are so glad there is a convenient place for us to eat now ! Thanks again Dean ! ! !<->1
Chicken & waffles + ham breakfast croissant were to die for . Bottomless mimosas were an added touch !<->1
They need to fire the doormen that they currently have . I was denied entrance because the asshole thought that my ID was fake . I showed him additional identification and he still denied me .<->0
Very yummy food . More meat than we could eat ... baked beans are amazing . BBQ sauces were on point . Staff very friendly . The new NONsmoking dining room is beautiful . Ca n't wait to go back , bummed we did n't spot Rick Sebak ;-)<->1
First time here . Food was really good . I got a cinnamon roll to start and a southwestern bene . I would order both again . Staff was great .<->1
Had an amazing experience at ISLA GRILL . Food was jam packed with flavor and taste . I had to turn my Tosilog in to the chef because I wanted it to have more crunch . Nonetheless I enjoyed it a lot .<->1
Just not goodOverpriced juice prices and not good foodAlso very strange to be under a real estate officeThe service was very sub parMaybe they should get rid if the gasStation sign and covers<->0
Hands down the best AYCE I 've been to with tons of different option and out server Jenn was super friendly and helpful ...<->1
Awesome atmosphere , killer food and a wine list that has great wine at fair prices . Serene environment that deserves your business<->1
So good ! We came here as part of Nosh Food Tours and I loved the pizza they ordered -- you ca n't even tell that the cheese is n't dairy .<->1
Went there on the advice of a friend . What a mistake and a waste of money . Save your time and money , go to Panda Express instead . At least their food taste better .<->0
Salad dressings could use a little kick but overall healthy good salads . Big portions . Good customer service !<->1
Wow ! We just got back from Boulevard Cafe .. what a wonderful experience . Everything we ordered was great ! One of our favorite restaurants in Toronto .. for sure . Highly recommend it ! !<->1
Pizza was hot and fresh and the service was amazing . Thanks Chad ! If I could give it a six star I would .<->1
Took over an hour to receive the food my family and I ordered . The 4 tables that sat down after us received their food before us . Restaurant was not packed . Will think twice about coming back .<->0
Great , consistent Chinese take - out in Green Valley . Quick delivery , I have never had a delivery problem . Food is tasty . Food is reasonable in price .<->1
I love the food here , especially the burritos , carne asada and macho burritos are the best . Always happy at this location , others are not as good . You got ta try it .<->1
Best wonton soup anywhere and extremely friendly and quick delivery ! ! !<->1
Service was fine , servers were attentive and met our needs . The food was okay , not terrible but nothing to rave about . Would recommend .<->1
Great Food And Amazing Customer Service hands down The short Girl behind the counter was very nice and a lot of help on what was good on the menu I will continue going here for Breakfast<->1
If the guys in the back would quit talking and REALIZE they work in a restaurant located in the airport ... it would n't take 15 minutes to get a meal ! ! ! When you have 4 people in the entire restaurant<->0
5 $ for ham & cheese croissant . One slice of cheese and one slice of ham . " Stay hungry my friend " .<->0
Neighborhood pizza joint , the service was great & very quick . Prices were very reasonable . There is seating available but it 's not a shutdown joint . The white pizza was very good .<->1
Love their combos on the menu .. Everything here is pretty much really good and clean ! If you 've never been yet you better check it out ! Service is fast and servers are friendly !<->1
Great food , friendly , fast service and clean environment every time we visited . Having this restaurant in our hotel made our visit enjoyable ! Will eat here every visit !<->1
I enjoy TAO restaurant and the service however the club is way overcrowded and overpriced . It can be a fun night out if it 's not so crowded .<->1
We come here all of the time and it 's amazing . We love the owner he is always hands on and that 's why this place stands out .<->1
Fast and delicious . Very reasonably priced bagels too . Cash only though so remember not to show up w / just your credit cards . I am a fan .<->1
Best wings in Toronto hands down ! ! ! Canes sweet heat is delicious . Customer service is n't the greatest otherwise would have given a 5<->1
I love Jess best in the biz what an asset she is love her ! ! ! Best Gluten free blueberry pancakes anywhere ! Service was amazing ! ! !<->1
This is truly a French bistro in the little desert town of Surprise . Everything was Delish .<->1
Great food . Takes awhile to cook but flavor and portions are amazing . Everything was good . Had the katsu and BBQ mix . Hard to decide which meat was the best .<->1
Fun atmosphere , reasonable ( for Las Vegas ) prices , and huge portions .<->1
Great beer great atmosphere ! Ordered the Poutine as an app and the French Dip . I 've ordered the French fries in the past and they are the best in Tempe !<->1
Food is always delicious ! Our server was Maryann and she was absolutely delightful . She made a great experience even better ! Love this place and would highly recommend the crispy chicken platter<->1
Just walked out of this place and will never go back . Wanted to get lunch and was happy to see they were n't busy . Sat at the bar for 10 minutes and got completely ignored by the staff .<->0
Great spot . Ambiance is super chill and everyone 's awesomely nice . Staff are cool and make you feel like a regular . Only reason I gave it 4 stars is my steak was good but not the best .<->1
Not a fancy place but the food is insane ! ! ! Garlic knots , Ghost Fries , lasagna and pizza . You will NOT be disappointed . Service was friendly and excellent .<->1
Good food ... good beer ! And great pumpkin spice beer ( if you get it while it 's in season ) . My only complaint it 's that it gets hot inside in the summer .<->1
One word describes this place " FRESH " ... originally started going to the one on Glendale back in the day ... JJ<->1
cheap crap , poorly prepared shriveled wieners . who puts sweet relish on a hotdog , blaahh I 'm still sick thinking about it . OWNERS , spend a little more than minimum wage and get some decent help in there . tots w cheese sauce ok<->0
Never a line and always fresh . Go here for lunch at least four times a week . They have the fresh brewed Fuze too .<->1
Great service ! Cool menu ! Cold beer ! Sushi was better than average but not worth the price . Try it once .<->1
This place is no longer the run by Japanese staff . They do n't have taro ice cream anymore and the food is uninspiring . WiFi is spotty .<->0
This is authentic Italian food that is well seasoned , well portioned and fresh . The restaurant was clean & quiet with low lighting . We were met with a smile as soon as we entered .<->1
We order food frequently and are never disappointed . From sweet and sour chicken to chicken and vegetables and everything in between ! Great place when having visitors from out of town . Portions are large , guests are happy ... and stuffed !<->1
Do n't believe the pictures they have on the walls , actual lobster roll is much smaller than advertised . That being said , it was n't horrible . Not a good deal for those from New England , but anyone will enjoy these !<->2
CLOSED see picture ... ' Intent to demolish ' sign on the front door when we tried to eat there today .<->0
Second cup with not so great service . Be prepared to get ignored on a not so busy time while barristas talk amongst themselves .<->0
Excellent restaurant And location . Food was good . We ordered from lunch menu . Daniel who serving us was very nice and polite . Recommend this restaurant .<->1
It 's a best location for shoppers to walk in club Monaco and to go downstairs . We enjoyed a break having a hot latte , filtered coffee and chai latte . Coffee were great with reasonable price . Small but cozy place .<->1
ver nice and classy restaurant . food was great . just a little too pricey but other than that , great views , nice place with good food<->1
I keep giving the Grand Cafe a second chance and then I keep regretting it . The service is incredibly slow and the food is only mediocre .<->0
Best fish and chips in town ! Nice and crispy , consistent . Nothing much to ask for .<->1
Lovee this place ! The mcgnarly burger is a tie for best burger in Scottsdale . The sweet potato tots here are amazing and it 's a really place with great music and dos equis on draft .<->1
Worst einsteins ever ! Do n't go through the drive thru unless you have over 30 mins to wait on a bagel . So slow and never have anything you want .<->0
This place is fantastic . Awesome pho , Great salad rolls , stir frys and well just everything is really good . Definitely recommend trying it ! !<->1
Franchising of this place made the quality go down , and prices go up . It takes too long to get food on a Sunday also , thief ought to plan better or something .<->2
Great place to stop and refuel .. The foods always fresh and the wait staff are very helpful ..<->2
I went to Dilworth Coffee for the first time this weekend and asked the barista for her suggestion , which was the Creme Brûlée . It was delish . I was impressed and will return .<->1
So yummy ! Great staff and awesome authentic mexican food ! It 's off the strip and well worth the drive .<->1
I love my local panera ! They get my order right 99 % of the time , staff is friendly . Use rapid order to avoid the wait during peak hours .<->1
My son and I just had breakfast here . The crepes were prepared perfectly and the service was great . The chefs were willing to alter ingredients and were very friendly and helpful in helping us choose which crepes to have .<->1
Hey this place is usually really good but they 've gotten smaller and smaller on fry portions on drive - thru orders . What 's up with that ? ?<->0
I came in around 12 pm , and I did not have to wait long to get my salad chopped . Staff is polite and patient . Food is healthy and very tasty . I really liked my avotaco salad .<->1
Great coneys ! Love that I have a bit of home here in Arizona ! Worth the trip down to Tempe ! !<->1
Food and atmosphere were very good . We were greeted promptly and with . Welcoming smile . Étouffée had a good amount of crawfish . Bumblebee stew and white chili , very good . But , wait until you try the cornbread ! Delicious .<->1
I was really impressed with how much better this location has gotten ! Food is Wayyyy better than it used to be . Service was great ! Awesome job in turning things around !<->1
Dinner with some Persian Friends : Food , service , value , ambience : 3.5 / 5 Food was tasty , no complaints . Repeat : Can see ourselves visiting again .<->2
Good drinks . Chill atmosphere and fun night of karaoke . Wonderful staff and fantastic food . We will definitely return next Saturday for karaoke and ad the regulars are super friendly and the staff makes us feel welcomed .<->1
ERVIN , our waiter was AWESOME ! ! He was very personable , made great recommendations and was very attentive . He was also very kind enough to give us a delicious desert . Thanks Ervin for the great service ! ! !<->1
Food excellent , atmosphere is really neat , but 2/3 times I 've been there service was extremely slow . An hour or more to get food .<->1
Best in concord area . Super fresh and great service You have to try this place !<->1
when the right barista is working , this is the best place in toronto for espresso or artisinal coffee - if you like the bulldog blend of beans ... which i DO ! unreservedly !<->1
Employees are very nice , but the toppings always seem low and the gummy bears are always hard . But one of the best yogurt shops in Chandler .<->1
Great karaoke place and the rrstaurant was able to get the steak out to me in less that 15 mins from ordering it<->1
Love this place ... only wish is that they have happy hour where ever you sit instead of just the bar . Food is awesome as well . Looking forward to the goat cheese guac .<->1
Amazing ! ! ! If you 're in the Scottsdale area this place has really good burgers . The Mac and cheese burger with the tater tots was awesome !<->1
This is one of the best places in Las Vegas for breakfast . The service is superior and you feel like a real french experience .<->1
Someone recommended this place for a nice meal . It did n't disappoint . We had the french toast , duck confit and veal short rib . All dishes were very savory and hit the spot after a long drive into town .<->1
Amazing service and food . We each had four different entrees that were unique and very favorable Matt our server was the best at his craft that any of us has experienced<->1
This place is sooo good . The custard is really good , cherry flavor is my fave , and it is fun to watch them make it too !<->1
I love their Chicken Madras Masala ... ! ! ! A must try . It has mouth watering flavours .<->1
Disappointed with burgers , expected so much more . I had billionaire burger it was ok , my husbands burger was a little better and our friends nom nom burger was over cooked . No room to try shakes .<->2
Nice location , we sat outside and people watched . Food was delish , I had steak tacos and hubby had a burger . I love the decor here too . We 'll definitely be coming back .<->1
Anything you get here is good , trust me ! And they have very good prices ... Ca n't beat that ! My personal fav 's : # 10 w / no meatballs # 25 # 41 ( i think ) crispy noodlesSalt & pepper squid w / rice<->1
The food was alright , however , at the end of our meal the hostess inappropriately badgered us for a larger tip . Save your cash and go to a more authentic Vietnamese restaurant that is n't staffed by money - grubbing white people .<->0
This place is great . They give you two salsa 's and a bean dip to start . Great food choices . Service was outstanding . Verde burrito was great<->1
My kids loves m & m but these store does n't really have a lot of choices ... likes Vegas though<->1
I eat there yesterday with my daughter in between 2:30 & 3:00 . Terrible service & the girl behind the counter had major attitude !<->0
Had a free ( comp'd ) breakfast buffet . Options were pretty limited and the quality of the food was not great . We did n't have to wait too long , but there are much better options in nearby casinos .<->0
What an excellent place for pasta . We had 4 different dishes , all excellent . The best one is squid ink pasta with saffron sauce . Compliment to the chef .<->1
first time there today my wife 's birthday waited patiently for 15 min.for our server . He never came to the table so we left . I was looking forward to tasting the food .<->0
1 year anniversary for the passing of my brother in law . Our server Lance was stellar . Food was great 11 Service was great ! Always . Always top notch ! ! !<->1
This place is incredible , the service , the food , the drinks , the atmosphere . I highly recommend this place for anyone . We will definitely be back ! !<->1
Excellent chicken and the fried green beans were good too ! Service was great ! We 're too stuffed for dessert but love the extra sweet sweet tea<->1
Good atmosphere , good miso soup . Great sushi , loved the spicy tuna !<->1
Terrible service and food . They seemed to be short staffed . They were out of the majority of sides and there was an obvious communication problem between the kitchen and wait staff . Our food arrived cold . Will never eat here again<->0
Love this place ! We hadCalamari , Pizza margherita and artichoke Joe ... Great with beersAnd good wine ! ! ! We come here anout once a month great place !<->1
Pet friendly place with amazing breakfast and pastry selections ... OH ! and their coffee beats Starbucks any day ! Nice little hidden gem !<->1
Just updating , this location does not have a drive thru . My interaction and opinion has stayed the same though .<->0
Not worth the money , horrible in every way especially the value .. I really expected more from a Hubert Keller restaurant , but maybe I caught them on a bad day ..<->0
Food is very good here . You can really tell that they have people who know meat as the smoked pork and chicken are very good . Nice little find near home and near the LA Fitness .<->1
great food and service . Get the bread in a cup . Fresh juice A + .<->1
So sad it is closing . I 'm not a local but I stop here every year and love the atmosphere , food , and beer selection . Bocktown will be missed !<->1
Yes ! ! ! The food is great and very reasonable . I had the enchilada platter with beef . It was really good . And the service was also very good . The one review was right - this is a pleasant surprise .<->1
Ate at this location twice first time was just ok ... and my second time I got food poising<->0
Terrible experience . Rude server . Will never come back to this place . It appears that they do n't care much about customer service .<->0
Their salted caramel brownies are delicious and you must try their macaroons . Great atmosphere and very friendly staff . They also have a good variety of sandwiches .<->1
Staff here are very friendly and helpful . However the macarons are very crumbly and dry . Tastes cheap and is not worth it . I 've had macarons from Ladurée at Yorkdale for about the same price and they are much better .<->0
The best oyster and crawfish restaurant that We have to visit every time going Las Vegas . Very nice and friendly staffs from the management to the kitchen . We love this place ! ! !<->1
It 's always a pleasure going her I love the little old lady behind the deli counter sorry forgot her name but she is the sweetest and there food is so good everything just like mama makes love u Roma deli .<->1
Thursday , 9:30 am , April . Good experience here , everything came out in proper time and glad they had harvest grain pancakes . Seemed clean and active . Negatives are that it 's small and under staffed .<->2
Best burritos in Charlotte ! By far my favorite burrito place in Charlotte . Do n't let the long line deceive you - it moves fast and is totally worth the wait !<->1
Nice place to get a quick and healthy meal ! We had the sandwich and soup combos and kid meals .<->1
I hate to do this but I just had too . This place came highly recommended and I love egg white omelettes . Mine however had a great big hair in the center . Waitress was really nice . Never did get to eat .<->0
Pretty fast , kind of greasey version of Chipotle . Not half bad for airport food , but pretty sad for vegetarians<->2
Best restaurant in Montreal . Unique , delicious and so so filling . Its very easy to over indulge with foie gras as the topping of many dishes .<->1
Hot Cheetos cheese fries were delicious ! Customer service was GREAT ! And the shop was very clean . My husband and I came around 4:30 pm on a Tuesday and there was no line .<->1
Service was good ... so was pizza ... but the avacado eggrolls were amazing ! .. best eggrolls i ve had ...<->1
Terrible service . Actually no service . If your a Seahawks fan this is the place for you ! Sat and waited for 20 mins without any service at all .<->0
Great food and unbelievably cheap ! I had the halibut and it was amazing . Our waitress was very patient and nice too . We were a large group with lots of requests .. Highly , highly recommended !<->1
This place has the best Italian hoagie ever . The pizza is also a very good change of pace from other traditional styles of pizza .<->1
I can not think of any place better when it comes to Mediterranean .. bang for bucks spent .. all vegetarian recipes are amazing My all time fave !<->1
Great place for breakfast and lunch . Love the food and service . The owner Mario is super nice !<->1
Tim Horton 's might just be the saddest part about Canada . No matter what location I go to , Tim Horton employees are unable to get my simple order correct . A disgraceful chain that makes Canada look like a third world country .<->0
Un de mes restaurants préférés dans Saint - Henri . Tout est excellent mais , j'ai un faible pour la salade de papaye verte et les nouilles aux crevettes et palourdes , à essayer absolument ! Service impeccable et ambiance géniale .<->1
Incredible seafood . Started with the grilled octopus and graduated to black cod . Both spectacular . Also they were great with Portuguese wine suggestions .<->1
Simply put , best Reuben in Cleveland . I would travel downtown for slymans in the past and am thrilled they opened in the independence area . Great bar , great and fast service , awesome corned beef .<->1
This place is amazing everytime I go . Coffee to die for with homemade syrups . Great salads and I love the balanced equation calzone . I love that they support locally and make everything fresh in house !<->1
Perfect location , good costumer service , great food and reasonable prices . I had the grilled chicken sandwich ( 3.50 $ ) really good filling sandwich<->1
The food is really good , affordable , and definitely more than enough ! It 's worth the price for sure . The staff are very friendly , I like them .<->1
Fried food only expensive ... serve food on hospital tray ( berk ) - long john slivers is cheaper if you are looking for that kind of food - the view is good though<->0
The food smells great from a block away , and the staff is super friendly ! Be prepared to wait in line , though , and BYOB for that line , because you 'll be there for a long while .<->1
Big menu and every item I tried tasted delicious . Octopus and stuffed shrimp were the best .<->1
Skip the $ 1 extra crunchy Bucks batter option , it is just a few small pieces of potato chips on top the batter . Does n't taste anything special . Definitely does not worth the $ 1 .<->1
The service is always friendly and accommodating . The vegetarian burger is to die for . It is only on the lunch menu but they will serve it at dinner if you ask .<->1
Very mediocre breakfast . I 've had better Omelets at Denny 's . For $ 20 an omelette I would expect better . The coffee was decent at least . Usual hotel fare that overpriced and underwhelming<->0
Good Indian food around scottsdale area i should say . Its not authentic but sure worth the money .<->1
I 've eaten here 3 times . First time rice was on the hard side . Second time thought I 'd give it another go and it was really good ! Third time hard rice again . For the price not worth rolling the dice .<->2
It 's not a bad place . It 's not far from home , prices are decent , has a nice patio that overlooks the city .<->2
It was terrible ... I went after I saw a 4 star rating but my experience was horrible . Will never ever go back again . Service was n't great ... the manchurian gravy was very very bitter . Ah awful .<->0
My husband and I have enjoyed a couple date nights here . Friendly staff , delicious food , ( the cornish hen practically melts in your mouth ) and a wonderful ambiance . We 'll surely continue to eat here .<->1
About the same as other locations for food . Location is not direct on main street and in and out can be congesting . Drive - thou moves quickly .<->2
Always great salads and sandwiches are miles ahead of chains like Panera<->1
Amazing ramen ! Ca n't get enough of it ! Wish there was one in Henderson so I did n't have to drive !<->1
My go to place in University Circle . Located in the Law School , this place is the only deli in the neighborhood . Great sandwiches , freshly baked cookies and brownies , and plenty of veggie options . Homemade soups are amazing , too ! We 're hooked !<->1
They have some SERIOUSLY delicious vegan pizza ( with or without Daiya cheese ) and vegan ice cream ! Pop - Up Pizza is also easy to find , and surprisngly not at all smokey despite being in a casino . Highly recommended .<->1
All is delicious Delisioso Tacón de camarón aguas frescasBurritos de camarónQuesadillas<->1
I love this place ! The staff is so sweet and coffee is amazing ! I love the Nitro Lavender Vanilla ! So happy to have a local place close by !<->1
since I have a hard time deciding , I got the Hokkaido and Okinawa milk tea blended together ! creamy , fresh and frothy ! I also like the rewards being linked to your number , no stamps needed !<->1
Good at what they do . Organic from scratch . Friendly . Sandwiches : tofu chicken avocado cheddar . Homemade soups good or bland and yum chutney . Salads dull . Interesting breakfast . Not cheap but you do get what you pay for here .<->1
Great food and service ! Place is small but comfortable . As soon as we sat down we had someone come to us for drinks . I will definitely go back to try some of the other menu choices .<->1
These people ca n't answer the phone or handle any type of demand spike . Please just close down and try something else . If wait times are going to be excessive , you must make your customers aware .<->0
Cleanliness is not on their radar . Outside patio was filthy , server kept running his hand thru his hair .<->0
the atmosphere of a corporate men 's club - lots of wood , leather chairs , repressed sexuality and self - congratulatory good cheer . good crab , good seafood , big drinks , decent steaks , adequate service : overall recommended for a good spendy meal in vegas .<->2
Great selection and good service . I love the selection of sushi and the staff was very friendly and helpful . The price was reasonable especially considering the quality of the food . I will be coming back here often .<->1
The best Greek salad , idk what it is about the onions in it but they 're so delicious . Also try the Tiramisu , they make it in house and it 's amazing<->1
I was staying at a hotel nearby for a night and ordered delivery . Their pizza is delicious ! ! ! Next time I 'm in the area , I will definitely order here again .<->1
Exceptional experience . Fantastic space , great entertainment and beyond amazing sushi . We had a crew of six and had an outstanding time !<->1
Great service And food was amazing ! ! We got hot wings , general chicken combo and five happiness and donuts ! ! Way too much for us to finish but everything was very good ! ! Will come again<->1
Excellente brasserie . Tout le charme d'une brasserie parisienne au coeur de Montréal . Service impeccables , un beau comptoir , des plats succulents et traditionnels . Je recommande d'essayer le pot aux feu , et les os à moelle .<->1
This place is pretty bad , everything Is frozen and microwaved , stood there and watched the trainee warm up the food . And everything taste like lean cuisine meals , portions are small prices are pretty high for the quality of food<->0
AH - mazing . I loved the option of vanilla AND chocolate cake donuts ! ! ! Also , I enjoyed the size of the donuts as compared to some other " custom " donut shops . I will definitely be back for more !<->1
Second time here . First time was ok . Food is actually pretty good . Service is spotty .<->2
Tasty , good tacos , but not unbelievable . If I could give it a 3.75 I would because I feel that is the most accurate rating . The chips and salsa were not the best , but the tacos were good .<->1
Awesome place for seafood . Had the king crab and oysters . Oysters were fresh and delicious . Wait staff was great and would definitely go back to any Hot N Juicy Crawfish restaurant .<->1
Have been coming here for years ! Great pizza and wings ; get the $ 22.95 deal and you save $ 8 ! ! Good lunch specials too ! Pick up ordering always ready within 15 minutes !<->1
Yes and yes . Great breakfast . Great lunch . I understand why there 's a line up , ca n't do it myself but yeah worth it . Simple , good food . Yes it will blow you away .<->1
Just tried this place . It was great ! I had the Chiang Mai Noodles and my wife had the Crispy Basil chicken . Great fresh flavor . We really enjoyed it . Ca n't wait till they get beer and wine .<->1
Love the chicken mushroom soup , super fast service , and really awesome prices . Wish there was a online menu . Overall excellent<->1
Pho Chandler is a mom and pop place and good . Nothing fancy . Service is always good . I have been to Vietnamese restaurants all over the country and Pho Chandler is good .<->1
I looooove this place ! Huge portions , great price ! Chipotle style assembly of custom burritos , tacos and something chipotle does n't have , chimichangas ! ! ! So awesome I live close by .<->1
Just stopped here yesterday morning for brunch and it was amazing . Cool space , nice staff , and great food ! A must stop for locals and out of town guests as well .<->1
The have pizza down pat . Love it if you order the meat pizza stand by for some seriously good sausage and pepperoni We hit this place once a week<->1
Been here a few times and their lobster salad is a must try . Totally recommend this place for their food !<->1
They had stale food in buffet . Looked like they forgot to refrigerate leftovers from the night before<->0
If you are looking for decor or ambiance , skip it . If you are looking for great sushi rolls , Korean dishes , excellent service , and free sake , this is the place .<->1
Amazing resturaunt . Their food tastes absolutely delicious , and the employees are so nice & helpful . I always have a great experience when I go to Mucha Lucha .<->1
Went here with 3 others for the smoke plate , a few of their app plates , cocktails and the Elvis dessert . Amazing service , great food . Thanks !<->1
Delicious ... Why this gets high stars is not necessarily for the regular sushi , as it tastes similar to many other places , but for their fantastic service and specialized sushi or creations . Never had sushi so delicious .<->1
Just remember to have Tea / Chai over here ! ! That 's the only thing that can get you here every evening ! Loved it completely ! !<->1
This place was delish ! I reccomend this place when you want to try something new or try a Thai dish !<->1
This place was great ! ! Good food ! ! Friendly people ! ! If you order the biscuit , it is ridiculous . It was about 4 " high and 4 " round . Flaky and delicious .<->1
It 's not bad but not the best of the El Campesino restaurants .<->2
Much better location than the one on Sunset in Henderson . I pass the Sunset location to come to the Eastern Ave local because they have MUCH better service and restaurant . :)<->1
I had breakfast this morning at this place good costumer service and prices it was my first time but definitely going back with my family .<->1
Jahnae and Jennifer are bomb ! Pickup orders in a timely manner and clean establishment . They also have boba which is tasty and offer 14 flavors .<->1
Coffee was good . The service sucked . Rude and very condescending . Maybe she was having a bad day . But man was she rude .<->0
The bartender is some kind of shaky fiend , but the owner was extra friendly .<->0
Got my burger but bad attitude server dumped fries over it that I had to dig for the burger . Terrible .<->0
Maybe one of the best PT 's in town ! Great open feel , never smoky , nice patio , separate restaurant for under 21s , and the coolest bartenders . Food is always good and beers are always cold !<->1
Mediocre sushi . Do n't go unless you are saving cash with a groupon ... These are offered almost once / week<->0
The crabfest rocks ! I 'll go there again . The bartender waited on us and Ryan was great . I 'd recommend this place to everyone !<->1
I love this place . The people here are all down to earth . The drinks are priced well , bartenders are super sweet ! My friends and I have always had a good experience !<->1
Amazing view over fountain hills , always fresh , delicious food , and even better service ! Highly recommend to visitors of Arizona or even locals looking for somewhere new to dine .<->1
the service were n't helpful when I needed help caring trays . crowded and the Cheese Enchilada was too spicy . do n't take kids there . They 'll only like the chips and beans . Rice was n't cooked .<->2
$ 35 for 2 atandard fare breakfasts out in the open with leaves falling on your soon cold food and in your self served coffee in a paper cup . Not impressed.too many hundreds of better options everywhere .<->0
I LOVE this establishment . Great beer selection , great selection , entertaining staff . Oh and good food too . Give the chili pizza a try for something different .<->1
I loved this old style Las Vegas restaurant ! I felt like I stepped back in 1950s . I came here on a Saturday night and they had live a performer and definitely enjoyed and I absolutely loved the lasagna !<->1
Buy the household cleaners & supplies for $ 1 . Store is clean & organized . Same plaza as Big Lots , Ross , many more .<->1
This was a cozy restaurant with very nice staff ! The good tasted great . I had a vegetarian omelette . You get to choose three toppings for the omelette and they have a good variety of options . Great experience !<->1
Favorite Chinese Restaurant ! ! Always the best food with lots of choices . Pricey but worth it .<->1
It 's an airport coffee shop . Higher prices and the coffee was n't great . Service was friendly . Overall , average . You 'll do okay .<->2
Best bean and cheese burritos ever ! ! ! And the red salsa is yummy . Plus the customer service rocks ! ! !<->1
The food did not wow us today but the service was outstanding and the manager is working hard to ensure that the food exceed his customers expectations .<->2
The food is amazing . I highly recommend the BBQ sampler . The smoked turkey is really good . The place has a nice atmosphere and great service .<->1
The service and food ( wings , fried zucchini , and dinner salad ) was good . It 's a great option if you live in the area to watch NFL games .<->2
Very good place for such a tacky name . Food is quite authentic and good and the atmosphere is nice . There lunch specials are a steal !<->1
The best cinnamon roll I 've ever eaten ! ! ! It literally melted in my mouth ! Love and will def be back ! Congrats to the owner !<->1
Delicious food . Great service . Everything cooked fresh . I had the pepper shrimp and it was so good . The fried rice and and noodles . Definitely one of the best West Indian food around .<->1
based on reviews ... made an effort to try this place . Worth the long walk . Very fresh food , good service and amazing sandwiches . Any chance they want to open a place in Boston ? ? ? :)<->1
These guys need to work on their customer service and supply chain . Maybe do n't ask me to wait as I stand in line and take a massive phone order which now puts me in the back of the line .<->0
Excellent little shop and reasonably priced . Lots of selection , top notch coffee and friendly service .<->1
5 * for the food ! Bun cha Hai Noi = Very Delicious Banh cuon =D eliciousFurniture needs upgrading . Under New owner ... food is a lot better now<->1
Came in . Waiter was alright . Gave me a stair like I did n't know what I was doing . He gave mediocre service . I 'm full<->2
Shrimp and grits ? Who would of thought this would be good ? First watch did , and they nailed it ! This breakfast is a real eye opener .<->1
Well we are sitting here bored , minus our amazing company . Waiting for our Reuben 's since umm about 7:15 . Service is terrible . The bus boy paid us better attention than our waitress .<->0
Probably the best tasting espresso I have ever tasted . Coffee was great too . I should n't have more than two shots of espresso but I really want more than two shots .<->1
Order take out once a week and it 's always great ! Friendly staff and great pizza . Locally owned and operated with a menu that includes burgers and sandwiches that are all awesome ! Best ranch dressing on the planet !<->1
All I can say is warm fresh apple fritters ( especially appreciated when I tailgate during badger games ) ... Mmmm<->1
Landed in here by accident searching for a different bar but the place smelled like bleach . Very plain bar however the drinks were cheap and the bartender was friendly . Just was n't our scene and did n't try food .<->2
Best place ever , has amazing cookies and good flavors , Nutella dark chocolate and expressio ! Good coffee slush too<->1
I was very happy with my enchildas and side dishes . Chips and salsa were not as good as I have had at other Mexican places in town .<->2
Do n't take my word for it or you have to do is look at how busy their take - out services are . So happy to have finally found good , no , very good , Chinese and the surprise area ! !<->1
No jasmine rice ? No thanks . Yellow curry was over powered by the taste of coconut milk . Thai ice tea was weak . It has too much milk and not enough tea . It was way too sweet .<->0
First time there , and it was really good . My wife goes with her work friends and always said she enjoyed it ... looking for a place and we were driving by ... good decision !<->1
Quality is down . Ate here many times but this probably our last . Desert was skimp with many from pre - made not fresh ! Salad was barely minimum . Sushi only Cali and tuna rolls . 29.99 for dinner on Wednesday .<->2
My new fav will def recommend to friends love it 's a little small but that burger is so juicy and good like wow friendly staff over all awesome experience<->1
So not worth the hype . Found the glazes and toppings looking rather gross . Not fresh looking with toppings spilled and not clean . The doughnuts looked nothing like the pictures and were just ok . Not worth the price .<->0
Ordered the Lobster Roll lunch special . It was good but I wished there was more Lobster in the Sandwich but I guess I can complain since I only paid $ 10 plus taxes and tip .<->2
Perfect food , unbelievable service . Do n't hesitate to try this steak house !<->1
Friendly service , great fresh food ! I had the marinated flank steak that was marinated , tender and juicy . My spouse had the blackened steak and loved it too . Will definitely visit again .<->1
The service here is horrendous . Once you get your food it 's pretty good but be prepared to wait 20 - 30 minutes for a simple burger . Ridiculous<->0
Oscar was fantastic . Great service and great food . I 've been to numerous capital grilles . This particular location was more like a Denny 's . Disorganized and messy .<->1
Always good , fresh and reasonable $ We always have the steamed dumplings Shrimp Lo meinProgrammed in the phone<->1
Fastest service I 've ever experienced . These guys pump out hot dogs and poutines like it 's nothing , order and 20 ' seconds later it 's ready , unbelievable . Ca n't wait to see the new facilities<->1
This is my favourite place to have a coffee and lunch . Friendly service , fairly priced , and food is amazing . What else can you ask for ? John<->1
Artichoke Heaven was . The Cochinita Pibil tacos were excellent . I 'm dying to try out the rest of their quirky menu .<->1
Great pizza just a tad bit on the expensive side . Prepare to wait 40 min 's to a hour for cook time for awesome pizza and the breadstick and chesse are awesome<->1
Food was average . Small portion sizes which left me hungry when I finished . My fiancés Mac n cheese had a thick piece of plastic in it which almost broke my tooth . Definitely not worth the money .<->0
Fantastic food at a great price . Love the lemon chicken soup complimentary appetizer and house salad . Pasteetsio is my favorite . George the owner is extremely personable .<->1
Very tasty beer . Dimmed lights . Relaxing hipster music . little pricey though .<->1
One of my favorite places in the surprise area ! Love all their pizzas and pasta , and the bread they give you before you order is absolutely delicious ! Awesome Italian sodas as well . The servers are always very friendly :)<->1
Awesome , Fresh ... nice hostesses , went on a Saturday afternoon was n't too long of a wait even with one side being down ... Will Return .<->1
FYI , BIrdsong 's beers have vastly improved ! Kudos to you and my god that honey pie was good !<->1
Not very clean and my smoothie tasted like straight upIce . Horrible smoothie and service for $ 7 ! Most I 've paid for ice<->0
Awesome ! ! Lunch specials great . Good fresh and portions are large . Services good and fast . Great lunch place . Was able to take half of my plate home they served so much . Lettuce wraps were amazing ! !<->1
This is great restaurant . Tortas are huge . Friendly people and service . The wife and I will be back .<->1
I really love the happy hour here . Great deals to be had on drinks & food . The drinks were delicious , the food tasty , & the service was consistently great throughout . Keep up the good work . I 'll be back .<->1
Burger was tasty , onion rings crisp and the service slow . I left satisfied .<->2
Very authentic .. I love the Sukothai .. Be careful , level 2 is very spicy in my opinion<->1
Family owned business very accomadating for our large party of 6 . Large portions of home cooked breakfast . Will stip there agsin if i m ever in Phoenix .<->1
First time here . Food was great . Beware of their spice scale as a 2 was spicy . I started with a 5 and was warned that would be very hot . We will come back here again .<->1
Absolutely love this place . The food was delicious ! The staff was friendly and accommodating to our group that started at 3 and turned into 7 . We enjoyed our time at Fez and will be back very soon .<->1
TBH ... when it comes to QUALITY burger ... this joint is one of the revolutionary ... with the old fashioned deli atmosphere ... i love their patties are soft and juicy and the way they melt the cheese on top is amazing ... MUST GO for burger enthusiasts !<->1
Best sushi bar I have found in Goodyear . I love the employees , the environment , and happy hour specials ! I would definitely recommend .<->1
Having been going to this place for over 20 years . The new location is not as big as the old one , but the food is just as good . I especially recommend the dumplings and ginger chicken .<->1
What a little gem ! So cute , and delish ! And Abita beer ! ! Thanks so much for the much needed gumbo on a rainy day ! !<->1
This place nails down chicago style food especially the Chicago style hot dogs and fries ... and do nt for get okie dokie popcorn and Jays . NOT Lays potato chips ... i highly recommend this place for good food and fun atmosphere . Kristin & Jeff<->1
Been hearing about them for years ... Love Backyard Taco , family owned with a fast friendly service delicious tacos , salsa bar . Its grilled meat , fresh veggie toppings . You will love it .<->1
Awful . Waiter had no clue . Food took 2 hours and was delivered cold . Stay away . This place is awful .<->0
This is my happy place . I love their miniature s'more pies , drinks , and atmosphere . Everyone is always super friendly and I have NEVER had a bad experience . My only wish is that they were open on Sundays ... # Gilbertproblems .<->1
Got food poisoning here 3/30 / 13 @6am . Vomiting all morning , diarrhea all night . Never eat here again .<->0
Worst service ever . These waiters gave us : serious attitude , terrible service , wrong orders , sub - par yet overpriced hipster burgers , and botched split checks . I 'd rather die of famine than ever eat here again .<->0
Ok nothing to be impressed with here . I d rather eat at Filabertos !<->0
The margarita 's were excellent ! Bartender was very nice . Tacos were very good as well !<->1
I got a cannoli there the other day and it was delicious ! I ca nt wait to go back and try the tiramisu !<->1
Aria cafe is a great spot for breakfast . I had the Mediterranean omelet which was decent . I also ordered the OJ and did n't look at the price . $ 8 for an OJ - people , do NOT order the OJ .<->2
Simply perfect and decadent French cuisine . I knocked out a whole baguette by my self with the best fois gras I have had In a while . The salmon was fantastic . Keep up the great work !<->1
Really good wood fired pizza oven creates the best pizza ! Grab a pizza and drink between 4 - 6 PM great happy hour deal . Beautiful bar and restaurant and friendly staff .<->1
It 's a small place on Bying & yonge street , so I usually get take - out . Takoyaki is my go to item , comes with 6 pieces . Pretty good with a fair price . By the way , you can park on the street .<->2
The food is great . Generous portions on the dinner menu . Great area and a nice little restaurant .<->1
Came here for breakfast . Loved their banana pancakes . WARNING : it is huge and feeds 4 ! Also had their Chicago scrambled eggs . Everything was good and came out quickly . Staff was friendly as well .<->1
Food is not really good . We had wings , a salad and mashroom pizza . Wings and pizza were not good . This place shoul be 2,5- 3 stars .<->0
I have LITERALLY been going here every lunch break for two years and I always love the quick and delicious meal provided<->1
Decent stuff at decent price . Enjoyed the pork bone soup . Would come here again . So I did get their pork bone soup again , twice , and they still do n't disappoint . So props to them .<->1
Food was very good but pricey ! Not the best location and a bit run down in the front . Inside the place is kept clean and tidy . Worth the one time trip .<->2
Great place to chill and enjoy some alone time with a cool ambience about the place ! First time trying the pork sandwich .<->1
Cool bar in central Phoenix ... love this place !<->1
just had to write a quick review . again about his place ... couldent say enough great things about them , great food and great staff ... do nt miss out on the best food in phoenix ...<->1
Super health minded prepared meals and snacks . Worthy of a stop in for any person short on time and big on health .<->1
Good brick oven pizza . Ingredients very fresh and tasty . Only complaint is sometimes the pizza gets greasy and soggy .<->1
This place is super yummy great service and little small but super yummy the short rib rice is a must and do n't forget about the 3 color curry amazing<->1
I like the chicken Katsu here , but not so much the beef teriyaki . Maybe because I 'm used to chicken teriyaki . Overall they have a nice , welcoming staff , a family friendly environment , and good food portions at a nice price .<->2
nice place to watch a movie . clean and very comfortable chairs .<->1
I must say I enjoyed my fish and grits today at this lil hole in the wall , customer service was also great the waitresses were on top of their game ! ! ! I 'll be back for me :)<->1
Despite the cramped seating this place is amazing . The food was as advertised and delicious with very friendly staff . A great local restaurant .<->1
First time tonight , and it was awesome ! Super good rolls and the yellowtail sashimi was fresh . Also the staff are super nice and the food comes out in a timely manner . Definitely will be returning !<->1
Its a decent thai food , had ordered drunken noodles with chicken , it was alright . I am basing my standards off the food I Have tried in Thailand , this was verrry " americanised " version of thai food .. Overall , mehh ..<->2
The line here is sometimes long even in the winter but is totally worth the wait . Everything on the menu tastes fantastic . I personally can not eat too much ice cream so even the smallest size is good enough to share .<->1
Had a great experience . Flavorful margs , and the tacos were great . Friendly service with a smile , and great music , especially when the Michael Jackson remix was playing . Will certainly be back .<->1
Best sushi and chicken teriyaki in all Brampton , they changed their name to 88 sushi but trust me it is the great same old sushi<->1
Surprisingly less expensive than you would expect for being inside of the Hard Rock Hotel and Casino . Classic dinner food and breakfast cocktails . Service is adequate . This is very much a middle of the road dinner for Las Vegas .<->2
My hide at spot when at the hotel . Get away from the noise with excellent bar service and quality food . Love that they 're open late too .<->1
This is by far one of our favorite places to eat . It is always spot on . Best chicken pasta and filet we have eaten in the area . We will always go there when we want to splurge .<->1
Clean environment , food is of good quality , tastes good , and friendly service . A well deserved 5 star . A wonderful gem in North Scottsdale especially if you are looking for a good Vietnamese food .<->1
Hands down , the best tacos you 'll ever have in Phoenix ! The Chipotle Cherry Steak tacos are truly to die for ! ! ! The Margaritas are outstanding as well !<->1
El Meson is a place you go when you want a cheap , and abnormally fast lunch . Do n't expect anything amazing , just cheap " Mexican " food .<->0
Quite possibly the worst service in the city . Average pub food , nothing spectacular , and nothing overly " gastro " about it . Not worth the horrible service when there are so many other pubs near by .<->0
Wow . The ramen here is amazing . So good I think about it hours afterward . The best broth , too . Pair the excellent ramen with the cool atmosphere and great staff and you have an instant winner .<->1
The best steak ever ! ! ! dry aged and ribeye with onions were cooked perfectly . No complaints . We had a side order of creamed spinach and broccoli au gratin .<->1
I love the atmosphere but the food is so so . Drinks are good tho ! If you can get a spot on to patio it 's so worth it . Bruschetta is my fav food and their pesto bread dip !<->1
Savory crepe tasted very good , and so did iced pourover coffee . But the crepe seemed a little too thick .<->1
Bruschetta was great appetizer . ! Chianti with a Lou pizza ( deep dish veggie ): Very enjoyable . Heaters on the patio allowed us to sit in the patio on and Az February . We will be back !<->1
Repeatedly knocked on my door to leave unwanted brochures in an apartment complex with explicit no soliciting signs .<->0
Fantastic selection and atmosphere . The BBQ food truck was equally terrific . I plan on returning very soon !<->1
I love Dutch Bros ! The coffee , the barristas - everything . I was n't even a big coffee drinker before I discovered Dutch Bros . Now I 'm hooked . :)<->1
Liked it a lot . We went here for burgers and beers for dinner and would come back here again . The beer selection is sparse but the burgers are huge and perfectly cooked and accompanied with equally large sides .<->1
Best Yogurt in town ! ! ! Awesome ! 1<->1
Friendly staff and amazing beer selection ! Also , great patio perfect for a relaxing afternoon or evening pint .<->1
Love this place , the food is delicious and the people are so kind . Do n't forget your socks though ;)<->1
Excellent Ice cream ! ! One cone is good enough for two people ! ! The flavours are rich and hit all the right buttons ! Very friendly service . Would definitely recommend this joint . There are a lot of options to choose from ! ! !<->1
Their brunch buffet and mimosa carafes are awesome ! But I still have to take a star off for the time that they promised us brunch for my bachelorette and did n't come through ...<->1
Horrible ! Wait time for the duck - 5 starsHorrible services - 3 star Cleanliness - 1 star Quantity of the duck - 1 starSince can not put negative 5 stars .. Have to give them 1 star<->0
This place is great ! ! You get a ton of good food at a great price . The people there are friendly . We will definitely be frequenting this place a lot !<->1
We love our experience there but the food ... amazingly delicious ! ! ! The chocolate lava cake is the best i ve ever had .<->1
If you 're by the D gates at Sky Harbor , this is your coffee stop . Much better than the Starsucks at the high C gates .<->1
The prices are obscene they cook in nasty old grease we had the fish and shrimp both were awful and not enough a two year old could prepare better food ! We were Very disappointed and will not be going back .<->0
I brought these home for christmas , and it seems I 'm now obligated to bring them with me whenever I fly home .<->1
Fun place , fun menu , good burgers ... painfully slow . Careful if you 're trying to squeeze it in a lunch hour .<->1
I 've only had their bowls here . The staff are so friendly and knowledgeable and always make great recommendations . The quality of their ingredients and condiments are top notch , especially for the price you pay .<->1
Drinkene var fantastisk ! ! Særlig jordbær - øl - mojitoen . Anbefales ! Ellers har de også veldig godt øl å hyggelige ansatte :-)<->1
Good Greek fast food , served in large portions . They need to provide more tzatziki sauce , or at least not charge you for extra . that would earn that 5th star<->1
Great value and incredible taste . Portions are perfect for being able to try many things . All thumbs up .<->1
Teriyaki chicken bowl you ca n't go wrong ! I may have had this dish about a dozen times . It 's big very filling and extremely tasty . For the price you definitely can not go wrong .<->1
Usually like this place but their service getting worse and worse ! You need to ask your every single stuff including chop sticks and napkins ... etc Well NOT going BACK !<->0
Four words , " Hair in my salad . " Seriously , I threw up a little when I found a long black hair in my sweet potato & strawberry salad .<->0
Great food , service is quick and food is great ! They also have speciality drinks that are awesome at the bar . Very casual , great place to come for even appetizers and drinks . Kid friendly . Desserts are yum !<->1
food is great . but service was rushed . not why we became regulars a long time ago . miss you Shanna !<->2
Great chicken . The calamari is also excellent . The location could be better but with food like this it is probably a good thing . If it were closer , I 'd be there to often .<->1
If you want bad food , shitty service and have it served out of a dumpster , than this is the place for you !<->0
I ca n't wait to go ! ! ! Every looks nice .. the burrito is so hugeeee ! ! Yummy yummy in my tummy !<->1
Awesome and huge store with 4 floors of everything you can think of possible . Pajamas , clothes , kitchen & cook wear , jewelry , toys , stationary , and of course every type of M & M in every color possible !<->1
Best chicken parm sandwich ever . I come here just for that but I like the salads and desert . Need to try pizza eventually but that sandwich is so darn good I always order it .<->1
This is my favourite all - you - can - eat place ! Only been once . But seriously . Really liked the AYCE ! Exclamation !<->1
This place is the bomb freaking dot com ! The chicken strips are sooo good and fresh , and I love their fries ! !<->1
Some of the best Cajun food I have ever had . I did a mix with three items with advice from the staff . They were very knowledgable and their suggestions were delightful !<->1
This place is incredible . Although a bit pricey , the food is phenomenal . The " slaw " is the feature appetizer and it is amazing ! Service is dynamic ! Go there for a date with your significant other !<->1
I went here for lunch last week and got my same ol ' Bento Box . The chicken was back to being awesome ! So at this point ... - 1 star for inconsistency ?<->1
Excellent place for a nice intimate dinner . The steaks and chops are out of this world . Lamb was fantastic . Our server , Chae , was outstanding . Highly recommended .<->1
It was good ! Not a big fan of the random ppl coming up to the table trying to sell us a little bit of everything !<->2
This place is great . Kid friendly and good pizza . We get the chicken Parmesan and split it because it 's good and huge . The bruschetta is also yummy .<->1
Great for brunch , good coffee ! Fast and friendly service ! The wings are awesome , and even if you are not a vegetarian you will like this place !<->1
You ca n't go wrong with a little Cracker Barrel . I got the chicken fried steak and it was great . My friend had the pecan pancakes and I do n't really like pecans .. But they were tasty !<->1
Outstanding customer service great food and great selection of music and activities for the whole family<->1
WOW ! At the Top of the World 1st told we were not dressed formal enough to eat dinner and then they decided it was OK . What a view , food is excellent , service great .<->1
Food was great ! Everything was a bit more fancy than expected . The service was very nice . They constantly cleared the table and refilled water for tea .<->1
pulled pork poutinetons of great beers on draft.incredibly lively crowd on the weekend.great servers explains the menuand suggested nice beers for us.reasonably priced .<->1
Big No .. Overpriced food with bad qualityGo to the other noodle place in the Venetian . Much better food with less money<->0
Ummm ... I do n't know ... I thought the chicken was too salty . I would n't get this again . This Chicken Now is located in the food court between the parking garage and the casino at the Venetian .<->0
Amazing food and great views ! ! Staff was friendly and knowledgable ! Will definitely be returning !<->1
I had the chicken curry and vegetable samosa . My Wife and i both loved the food ! She especially loved the samosas and sauce . The curry was perfectly spiced for me . The chicken and rice were delicious as well .<->1
Fresh bread , good selection . You have to try the Pesto aioli . Board games at every table . Lots of stuff for kids .<->1
Good pizza , nice place & the owner was very accommodating . I 'm a fan .<->1
Got delivery within 30 minutes . Delicious beef pho with fresh basil . Still hot when it arrived and would order from there again .<->1
We have friends that are big fans of this restaurant , but my impression was that Postino was Ok . The bruschetta was pretty good , and the salad and wine were just ok . I thought that it had nice ambiance .<->2
This was my place during the last Stanley Cup run ! Great specials , good food , & fun place to chill and watch the games ! Ca n't wait to go back !<->1
Great French food in a beautiful room -- OhLaLa is the real deal . Service was excellent , wines were good , and every dish we tried was delicious . We enjoyed it a great deal .<->1
Very nice establishment ! Took a bunch of corporate folks here for lunch . Great Menu and Great prices ! This was my second visit . Keep it up .<->1
The menu is limited but it 's because everything they do they do great . Hands down one of the best waffles I 've ever had - just the right amount of crispness - and the bacon is always cooked perfectly .<->1
Really ? Sold out of half your donuts at 930 on a Sunday ? Also , customer service was severely lacking .<->0
Just a solid bar and a great time with co workers after a long few days of work .<->1
Very fast and friendly service . We choose to eat here when deciding to eat out . Clean bathrooms and a great atmosphere<->1
This place is great . I will be coming here more often . It 's very clean and the plus you can see them make your food , which is important . Food is bomb.com I dig .<->1
Very nice looking location . Nice staff ( unlike most Tim Hortons ) . And special products I have n't seen anywhere else ( I . e . , " Premium Coffee Cake Tulip " muffin ! ) . Coffee is also consistently good here . Who knew .<->1
Prairie Diner , it 's just so old school and that 's OK ! There not pretending to be anything , it 's like walking into the 1970 , s just good home cooking at a fair price .<->2
First time i have been here , Very beautiful nice elegant coffee shop . The workers are SOOOOOO nice . Will definitely come back<->1
It is Real great food and extremely decelious . I always go there for my lunch . My kids love it . I go everyday<->1
This place is amazing ! The donuts are always fresh and delicious . The staff is energetic and courteous . The Big Poppa Tart is a foodie lover 's dream come true !<->1
Wow , I am old . Thus bar was buzzing with a bunch of low 20 somethings in a Friday night . Terrible table service . Just go to the bar and get your drinks .<->2
honestly i could n't even enjoy my drink because the smell was so bad . all i wanted to do was get the hell out of the building .<->0
Tastes authentic . A little pricey . Great place to try for matcha lovers . For the price of the dessert I wish there were more seating options .<->1
So yummy 50 or more Brunch and lunch options ... Best buffet on the strip<->1
Their scrambled eggs were gross and their potatoes that cone with the egg & meat dish were cold and stale !<->0
Great food , friendly staff . Definitely recommend this place to anyone who wants some decent food . Do n't be disuaded by the look of the outside , the inside holds great treasures .<->1
Only managed to make it here once before I moved out of state , but this is a great local coffee shop ! Excellent coffee and latte art and flavors ! Cute and clean shop !<->1
Definitely not the place you want to eat . This is my weekend bar , just for drinks !<->0
The teriyaki steak on top of the kale salad is awesome ! I will say it is a bit pricey , but sometimes you get what you pay for .<->1
Go to Roberto 's for nachos ... Taco y Taco nachos were no bueno . Chicken tacos were alright . One star for the soda and one star for the flan .<->0
This place is legit . By far one of the best fried pork lion in las vegas . They put a lot of vinger in the potatoes salad , which make it taste better .<->1
I 've been here twice and both times the food was subpar . Service was friendly but not helpful . I hoped this restaurant would be a success .<->0
They had a great selection of pies , but I was n't that fond of the crust . I prefer one made with shortening , but this tasted more like butter . Just a personal nitpick !<->2
Great hole in the wall sports bar . Great location to sporting events . Cool run down atmosphere . Good service , cold beer . Good pub grub menu . Greasy juicy saucy cheesy , burgers are good , philly cheese steak is fantastic .<->1
Food was great , took a while for waitress to remember to bring our food but she did compliment us with dessert . Place was small but again food was great , fresh , and delicious !<->1
Great place ! Food and staff are wonderful . Would be nice if the news was n't on tv so one could relax and unwind ; escape for a minute ! ! !<->1
The Shrimp Pad Thai was great serving size for the take out was smaller than expected ! Thus the 4 stars ! ! I will definitely be back because I want to try the Yellow Curry next ! !<->1
Not great , I would have preferred a frozen pizza instead . Super greasy , not a crispy crust . RUN to Grimaldi 's instead ! !<->0
Amazing service and management ! All of the employees there are friendly and helpful . Also , the kitchen looks really clean !<->1
Best sushi experience in Phoenix by far . Juno - san is the best ! Ordered the omakase as usual . Amazing ! U wo n't be disappointed ! Arigatou gozaimashita !<->1
They are open on Easter and usually pretty late . What I do n't like is that they stare out the window to ascertain what you look like before you come in . # shady<->2
This place is great , they really listen to their customers . So many customers mentioned wanting vegan mayo , so they now have vegan mayo ! I am so excited ! !<->1
Serves a fantastic salade food is good but not great , high priced small portions , great place before a Habs game .<->1
I have had delicious food twice and my family raves about it . A huge bonus is that almost everything on the menu is under $ 10 .<->1
Gluten free options here ! You feel welcome with a food allergy , not like a nuisance . Delicious ! ! !<->1
I liked everything I ate here , and I 'll definitely be back . Service was great , and it 's open late .<->1
I loved this restaurant ! It was my first tjme trying this place and it was totally worth it . I would completely recommend this to anyone . Price was fair and the service was quick .<->1
Really good food ! The pork bite dim sum and brisket sandwich were standouts . I knocked off a star because I think it 's a bit over priced for what you get .<->1
The Pho tastes real good and I love ordering the Spicy Beef Satay . Delicious and adds some great variety to an already diverse menu . Staff is super friendly and will treat you well . Great spot for the Southwest !<->1
They are consistent . That much is the case . We swing through from Happy Hour freezes . $ 1 and get the blue is my recommend . Employees are polite from time to time .<->2
My advise : go somewhere else . I work nearby so I wanted to get lunch ( take out ) . Food is not tasty , expensive for take out lunch box . Even interior of the place tells you all .<->0
the only thing that 's even halfway decent here is breakfast . do n't order dinner here unless you have self respect issues.they have good toast.sad that this is all i have to say , is n't it ? that 's really how i feel .<->0
The service here has been incredibly slow every single time , during non peak hours no less .<->0
This place is awesome . It 's small and homely . Tucked away in a shopping center on Stephanie . Great food ! Awesome staff ! You have to try the red velvet pancakes and / or the Kalua grilled cheese .<->1
Great food ... huge portions including the salads so plan to share . Was n't a fan of the seating or lighting but will visit again .<->1
I finally stopped in ... And now come back often . Tasty . Fair prices . Give it a chance .<->1
Ehhhh I do n't know ... This place did n't impress me . Had the hummus and avocado salad . Both kind of bland and do n't me wrong , I love Mediterranean food ... It 's was like hospital food trying to be Mediterranean .<->0
Lunch buffet for 10.95 . It was ok meal . Nothing special . Naan was yummy and fresh , the rice not so much . I liked the goat curry from buffet<->2
Please note the Soup it Up ! location at the 20 Bloor Street East is NOW CLOSED ! Since early 2014 , the closest location is now at Toronto General Hospital ( 200 Elizabeth Street ) . Location map : http://www.soupitup.com/locations/#map_top<->0
Excellent food and service but prices are quite steep . For this price level I would go instead to one of Mexico City 's fantastic tasting menu restaurants like Biko or Pujol . I would think twice about returning here .<->2
Wow . Messed up the order and forgot some of my meal . None of the phone numbers work so you ca n't even call them . Crazy<->0
The best sea bass I ever had . My friend had liked her grilled salmon too . Our server Joshua was professional and attentive . Restaurant is beautiful located in non gambling hotel . It was very nice experience .<->1
Love this place . Bartenders are great . They always have events like UFC and other sports on . Great place to go for those weekday nights . Actually , those are my favorite times . A great vibe in non peak hours .<->1
Good pizza . Huge calzones . Good apps . Usually takes 45 minutes to get . If it came sooner would get their 5th star .<->1
A friend of a friend recommended the cappuccino here . It 's $ 3.85 to stay , $ 3.95 to go . It was good , but not anything deeply amazing . It looks like you can sit around for a long time without being scrutinized .<->2
Loved it , did n't experience anything negative . Its 12 bucks to locals on a weekday with a Rio card .<->1
This is a really cool outlet . Too bad it 's so damn far from everything else on the Strip .<->1
Worst experience there , it 's usually good . When you do n't eat chicken on the bone and you get a bone in your chicken . Hmmm<->0
Food is decent but the service sucks if you sit at the bar . They get so busy they ignore you . It 's easier to order ahead and pick it up to go .<->1
great thai food ! And nice service . Love the Thai Ice Tea very authentic flavor . Must go place on late night party ! ! !<->1
Just ordered 2 cheesecake and a salad ... those cheesteaks are the real deal . Super delicious ! ! They also delivered it to my house super fast and brought me a complimentary desert . I will defiently become a regular . Good job guys :)<->1
So sad we went to the unknown closed University Circle restaurant a few minutes ago . Very disappointing . Hope to visit Rocky River soon ! !<->1
Amazing ! This restaurant is so good ! You will not be disappointed going here for dinner ! Well done Cleo ! We will be back !<->1
Did n't try the food but the beer is EXPENSIVE . Prices that rival the Strip . Decent " atmosphere " , but they do have indoor smoking which stinks .<->2
One of my favourite gyro spots . I usually get the lamb gyro . Will try a couple meat sticks next time . Although they are right beside Messini 's I alternate between the two . Really nice staff .<->1
Service was terrible . Barmaid was rude , and seemed absolutely uninterested in serving us . We will never go back to this place again !<->0
Very impressed with this place . Great food with healthy options . Awesome customer service and cute decor ! I will be back often .<->1
I always love this place ! ! ! Drinks , food and staff are amazing . I keep going back ! The guacamole is to die for . Every meal I have had , I have loved !<->1

My favorite place to eat pho ! The prices are so affordable . I would eat here every week !<->1
My first Vegas buffet was here ; The Wicked Spoon ! Wait time was not long at all . Selection was great for the price paid ! Waiters / Waitresses for awesome ! I definitely will be back !<->1
I loved this place . Beef Chow Fun outstanding and Chicken with pea pods . Both sauces are really delicious . The best ! Cena Bojarski<->1
Got take out while staying at The Cosmopolitan . The classic burger with American cheese was delicious . The bread was delicious . The fries were ok . Also ordered the calamari which came with two dipping sauces , was ok .<->1
First time here but not the last . Super good down home food with a country family atmosphere . I 'm thinking I 'll be a regular .<->1
I like this Mr hero location , always friendly service and the place seems clean . The lady at the counter is efficient , unlike most places such as this in the area .<->1
The waffle is the best ! The bacon is thick cut ! A must come to when visiting phoenix . There was 20 min wait though<->1
Great Pide 's and there Green Goodness juice is awesome . Breakfast Burrito special is great too . Love this place !<->1
I loved their ambience and service and great food . They are generous with chips and salsa and sauces . EXCELLENT SERVICE . I will be back again for sure .<->1
Best chilaquiles in town .. if you in to the real chilaquiles spicy and delicious , ask real chilaquiles with habanero salsa . Simply the best two thumps up .<->1
Had to wait 10 mins to be seated while two waitresses passed by . Had to wait forever to get menu . When decided to walk out , a waitress passed by but did n't even bother to ask . Very poor customer service<->0
Chloe 's corner is a must for a casual breakfast . Quick , delicious , reasonably priced with a varied breakfast menu with healthy options like fresh berries , fruit , yogurt with granola and steel cut oats .<->1
Good food I ordered the boiled shrimp and crab legs food was cooked just right I will definitely be returning .<->1
The quality of turkey they use is not very good ... took it off and ate the rest . The bread on the sandwich was great . But for the price I thought they would use better meat .<->2
This shop is small and the staff is very friendly . I had the teriyaki beef and my boyfriend had the ramen noodles . We both loved it and it was very delicious . We will come back for sure .<->1
Enormous portions . Good home - style food . Quick friendly service . Only downfall is limited seating .<->1
Food was good . Atmosphere was warm and rustic . Meats were cooked nicely but probably not a place I would specifically have a craving for .<->2
This morning was our first time there ! I will for sure be going back ! ! ! The workers there are so energetic , up beat , & super friendly ! I ordered the caramelizer freeze & it was delish ! ! ! Welcome to Vegas Dutch ! !<->1
So very friendly stuff The food was amazing It 's my first time at this restaurant and definitely I will come back Everything is so perfect<->1
Food is just OK , awesome beer selection and good happy hour deals plus a reverse happy hour after 10 PM . If you want awesome steaks spend the extra money and go to T - Bones in Red Rock . Wayne Gorsek<->2
First time here . Crowded location but the sushi bar was open . Server was great . Sushi was very good . Very filling !<->1
Sub par and over hyped . Presentation is good but food is just okay . I would choose other local restaurants over this one .<->2
I love this place . It 's a very cozy wine bar with excellent food , drinks , music and artwork . Such an amazing place ! ! !<->1
One hell of a custard place . If you do n't know you better ask someone . Then this thing called economy came along and this one is no longer at the location . Sad sad day for me :(<->1
Thought it would be better . small portions . burger was ok . fries seem frozen . not the best fries .<->0
The food was well priced and the actual location was n't too bad . My wife had the spaghetti and meatballs and I had the lasagna . Both were really salty . Probably wo n't go back .<->2
Very good tasting food . I ordered the double char burger and have to say it was better than in n out !<->1
Warm plates mixed with raw sashimi is never a good mix . Basically served warm sashimi . We have n't been back . There is no in between with this type of food . Either good or not .<->0
I just had to make an account because of how disturbed I am that I just found a penny - sized piece of plastic in my meatball .<->0
I love this place it reminds me of the hamburger stands in my home town ... long beach ca<->1
Great happy hour the lobster tacos are amazing .<->1
I have pass this place many times driving home from work . I was glad I stopped . it was very good . I have hit every Thai place in town . I would visit this place again .<->1
Real Italian sandwiches , groceries , pastas , and salamis . I enjoyed my experience very much and will be back ! Try the Italian sub !<->1
Came in Saturday morning . It was busy . The place is really small . Decor is simple but the food is delicious . Had the eggs benny . I would definitely return .<->1
Not a fan , the food here is cheap and it shows . Not my style at all ! It 's pretty dirty in the dining area . The staff is nice but the place is really gross . Come here at your own risk .<->0
The food was really and the beef was good quality . Our server nana and jayden were super welcoming !<->1
Exceptional coffee . Best in Cleveland . Setting is a clean , friendly and relaxed atmosphere . Staff are true batista 's . Great experience every time I 've been . It is worth a detour from the usual grind !<->1
Tasty burgers . The Jenis ice cream dessert sampler was pathetic in size for $ 5.00 .<->1
The portions are on the large side . My husband and I were able to share our breakfast . Fresh fruit and crispy house potatoes were a plus . Enjoyed our meal so much , we ate here again on our 2nd day .<->1
$ 1 margaritas + $ 5 lunch specials make this a great place for lunch ! Went for dinner , food was still very good but not as absurdly well priced ( but still very reasonable ! )<->1
I have been there a few times , buffet is good , comes around $ 14 per head and worth it . Good options for non veg Indian food .<->1
Very nice servers . Great Vegetable Samosas , and a calming atmosphere outside of the heat .<->1
Get the alien burrito it is delicious ! ! ! My favorite is a Mexican mocha with an add shot !<->1
Not good because frostings tops are too sweet for an adult.good cake under it . I tried a dozen including all the favorites mentioned on yelp.not planning to return<->0
Great food ! ! Check out their happy hour . The street tacos and chicken quesadilla is soo good . Our waiter sucked ( Sonja ) had to flag her down every time . Never checked on us .<->1
Yuck . Cheapest ingredients , worst pizza sauce in Ontario .. Maybe north America . I 'd walk a few blocks down the street , better options !<->0
I had a hamburger and it was disgusting . Yucky .<->0
Dave was amazing ! Drinks stayed full . We laughed , we cried , we stumbled away very happy . Mmhmm ! Food and drinks 100 % on point<->1

Great zappolis ! Great pizza ! Great wings ! For a great price ! Definitely recommend ! Great staff too !<->1
Finally , a normal ice cream parlor ! ! ! Just what we needed . Good prices n many choices in ice cream . The man at the counter is super friendly . We will be back ! (:<->1
It 's hands down the best shawarma place in whole of North America . The spices are perfect and the food is just delicious . So glad we discovered this place ..<->1
Worst place ever food took forever to be made and was n't even made with love after all that time they took on it ! !<->0
One of my favorite buffets ! They have everything here ! Our server was nice to take us to a different table because the one we were at was small . Great service and great food<->1
i continue to be surprised about how good the food is here . every dish i have ordered has been delicious and unique . and the biscuits ... divine !<->1
Greasy empanadas , horrid breaded poblano pepper filled with greasy cheese , dry chocolate cake and overpriced margaritas . One of the worst meals I 've had in recent history .<->0
Best ice cream in a great neighborhood . Friendly service . Creative flavors . Whenever I 'm out for dinner in Tremont , I skip dessert and come here instead .<->1
Plus + sDrive Thru RxPhotoRed Box for VideosRight by my HouseNear Pita JungleDownsideNo ParkingSlow Service<->2
The rice and the noodles are always old here never fresh and as for your meat you pick always dried out not worth the time go the the mcdonalds right next to it<->0
Food was okay , I just do n't like the smell of dirt in the air !<->2
Food was ok . Host sat us at the bar when she said that the dinning room was full . After us a bigger party came in and they were sat in the dinning room .<->0
Best experience here . Quality food and great service . They made us feel very welcome and important . We would definitely be coming to this location . The best go to spot in town for acai and more .<->1
Some of the softest donuts I 've ever had ! I LOVE the Fruity Pebble donut ! Just the right amount of frosting to cereal . It 's a must try :) trust me .<->1
Any meat ANY meat you could possibly think of ! Vegans stay away ! ! Meat ! ! ! Great prices , fast and friendly<->1
Love this place . Friendly and speedy service . Ice cream is yummy . Do yourself a favor and take a drive here , you will not be disappointed .<->1
You 're better off getting off than going through the drive thru , spent 20 + minutes there . Save yourself the time and get off instead .<->0
I love this place ! ! Quiet and so peaceful . This is the place where you can enjoy a cup of coffee and do homework without anyone bothers you ! Everything is delicious p<->1
Loved this place . Went for a friend 's birthday and it did not disappoint . The salmon burger is a must try . Excellent . Make sure to call ahead and make reservations as there are n't too many seats .<->1
The food is amazing and the staff was great ! Hands down the best green salsa we 've ever had . We hope to go back before we leave !<->1
Really good Barbeque and the best corn soufflé . I usually get the two meat plate with sliced and chopped brisket . Spicy Barbeque sauce is my favorite but both of the others are good too .<->1
It 's fantastic poutine , tons of choice , at a good price , in a great atmosphere , with friendly staff , and drinks . Really , what 's not to like ?<->1
Fries were soggy / undercooked . Burger just so / so . Had the A - 1 cheeseburger w onions and shrooms .<->0
Very good service . I love this place . Great serving and atmosphere . So a Google search and Yelp search brought us here .<->1
Food is great ... Different cuisine for breakfast then you will find anywhere else . Pastries are awesome . Would be five stars but a little pricey .<->1
Fun , unique atmosphere ( hippie / indy / hipster / whatever these kids are calling it these days ) . Interesting , tasty food . Above all , awesome retro decor . A Pittsburgh treasure .<->1
I had tried this on my last visit to Toronto , and found it to be delicious and satisfying ! I had ordered food for takeout and I was pleasantly surprised with the generous portions !<->1
This place was awesome ! ! The apple pie cocktail and the kerfuffle was soooo good ! The pretzel bite app is also delicious .<->1
best bbq ever been there a few times and its amazing especially there sauce<->1
I wanted to like this place , but the service was extremely poor and the food was not good enough to overcome that shortcoming .<->0
Came here again by chance and the place has not improved at all . Egg in the soup was rotten and the meat was cold and extremely salty . Asked the waitress for more water and she brought me the bill instead .<->0
Food was okay nothing fantastic . Only ate 1/4 of my sandwiches bc it was covered in Syurp not something I think was worth $ 30<->2
If you want to stay in business , you need to be open longer than 8 hours . An open time of Noon wo n't work .<->0
Great healthy rice bowls , smoothies , salads and more . I like the smoothies as you can add a supplemental energy boost that helps with energy , immunity , recovery and more .<->1
Been going here for years . One of the best burgers around . Now I take my kids here and have them hooked as well . Highly recommend by me .<->1
Easy to find parking spot around the restaurant . Very delicious drunken noodle and tum yum soup ! And friendly staff too . Highly recommended !<->1
Good start ... supposed to be adding to the menu , which should be a good thing . Great grown up mac & cheese , burgers , fair fries & o - rings . Nice service from Robin .<->1
Banderas , you never disappoint ! My husband and I love gong there on date nights and special occasions . Extraordinary food selections and drinks ! Highly recommend the desserts !<->1
The owner helped me pick some good stuff to put with it . Recommended the sunset beach i believe and it was delicious !<->1
The menu selection is excellent . The server asked us where we wanted to sit , but sat us somewhere completely different and she was really slow in getting us our check . But the food was great .<->2
The food was excellent , French toast , pancakes , waffles , eggs , potatoes , even the coffee was delicious . Definitely give this place a try ...<->1
My pho ( broth soup ) was ' good ' but not worth $ 13.00 , it was meatless and was not filling - i can not justify that price for a broth soup . Left feeling a bit ripped off .<->2
Great food . Authentic , flavorful and genuine cuisine . People wo n't be disappointed unless they 're expecting fancy and ambiance .<->1
Great service great food ! This place was clean upbeat . I would definitely recommend to friends and family<->1
Just had the pineapple jalapeño margarita ... oh so good ! But you have to like spice ! ! ! Empanadas are Delish ! Half price apps for happy hour ! Definitely with a try ! Will come back to try more goodies !<->1
Lots of dirt in my food today - I think they forgot to wash the salad ?<->0
Fabulous deli in Scottsdale of all place . If it was in Los Angeles I would eat here every week it was in New York you would be world - famous everything was great including the service<->1
We went there for Sunday brunch , did n't know that we had to have reservations . We got lucky and was able to get a table at the bar . The service was OK and so was the food .<->2
Excellent food , my go to place for sushi and friendly staff . Always clean and decent prices .<->1
Very good pizza place , the employees are very nice to you and the pizza is very good . Definitely a place worth trying .<->1
They usually get it right but not this time . Ordered eggs over.medium and they can out super runny . Did n't get my plate back until everybody else was done and nobody checked up on me .<->2
Always good food and drinks . Service is real good . I love the hummus trio app and several of the dishes like fish tacos , salads , burgers . Ca n't go wrong here .<->1
Great dark and sultry little lounge , one of the hippest , coolest and most urbane in a town full of college bars and blue collar taverns . They also have pretty good food and a more secluded room called the Sidecar .<->1
This is a great place to go for good pub food . In the area this is my favorite , and I have been there many times . I like chicken wings there , they are actually decent size and well made .<->1
Friendly staff , could use more seat / table space inside .<->1
The foods really delicious Chef Paco made the best Mexican foods ever and very surprising , he came to our table asked how is the food ? Wow ... he really put his effort above and beyond<->1
Best sushi restaurant in the GTA . The atmosphere is amazing . The food selection is varied , unique , and everything tastes great . Do order the Fire and Kamakazi roles , they are to die for !<->1
Best and most unique pizza experience I 've ever had ! Taste is amazing , atmosphere is cool , and price is affordable . Go - to date spot<->1
The shop assistant is super nice , but the taste ( macarons ) is nothing impressive . I 'm a bit disappointed it 's just sweet that 's it . If you happen to pass by , try it . Otherwise , do n't go for it .<->2
This place is everything you would expect . Educated you on butterfly 's and a shit load of butterfly 's . Definitely worth checking out at least one time<->1
Grocery store was clean and the produce is a lot fresher than the other Hispanic grocery stores . Overall , El Super is an Americanize grocery store . Nothing special .<->2
I was duped ! ! ! Lack of karaoke . DJ talks too much . If I wanted to go to a club , I 'd have gone to one . The food is the saving grace .<->2
Great atmosphere and service . Sat at the chef bar and enjoyed watching the food being prepared . The chickpea fritters were excellent and the burger is to die for ! Ca n't wait to come back .<->1
I love this little market ! It 's perfect for someone living right across the street , and has pretty much everything I need for reasonable prices . I never need to go any farther than across the street for groceries !<->1
What a wonderful place to have breakfast . Christian owned . Friendly service . Food is amazing . Very clean . A place were locals eat . Would return<->1
... awesome breakfast grate waitresses missing you all your staff<->1
Pretty tasty ! We ordered a carne asada quesadilla and asada rolled tacos . The meat was fresh , tender and flavorful . Their food is n't overly greasy and reasonably priced . I will definitely come back the next time I visit AZ !<->1
Great food at reasonable prices . The burgers are pretty amazing and tasty . The staff was polite and friendly . Thumbs up !<->1
Great atmosphere , I took my 13 year Daughters here for their birthday dinner . The music here is right on point<->1
This is a nice place to win some pocket change . Get some snacks and even get a cool room to stay over night . I love the slots ! And the poker room :)<->1
We thoroughly enjoyed the drinks , apps , entrees and desserts . Our waitress was kind and attentive . We are thrilled to have this high quality locally owned restaurant and market down the street !<->1
The older gentlemen who I think probably owns the place was so helpful and gave my husband great advice and told us how to save water when filling up bottles ! So excited it 's so close to our apartment<->1
Went here our first night in Toronto . Good service , kids loved the spaghetti and keep raving about it . I had the penne bolognese and it was satisfying .<->1
I had the best pumpkin spice latte that I 've ever had in my life ! Great vibe and service at this authentic French cafe .<->1
Couples beware . My husband and I went on a date and were told it was family style . However , we were n't told the sizes were for 4 people . So much food was wasted , not to mention paying twice as much .<->0
Fantastic restaurant . Great service . The hubs ordered chocolate ravioli with butternut squash filling . The pasta is so fresh and light . Flavors are amazing . Always have a great experience here .<->1
Tommy makes the best drinks ! ! ! And is soooo fun , makes you feel right at home ! Husband and I came here after a long day and it was da best !<->1
Great cowboy atmosphere , and the food is good too !<->1
Belle épicerie bio , prix un peu plus élevés que la moyenne mais belle sélection de fruits et légumes et le prêt - à - manger est sympa au besoin !<->2
My absolute FAVORITE chinese restaurant everrrrr ! ! ! Try the WALNUT SHRIMP or the VILLAGE RICE NOODLE ! the staff is ultra friendly and the food is soooo delicious . it definitely kicks pei - wei 's ass . :) tell Young that Alli sent ya !<->1
Very tasty ! Had the pork and kimchi soup . It came with rice and some other small side dishes . Very reasonable prices . Will definitely return to try some other dishes .<->1
We were surprised by surprisingly nice ambiance in an unassuming strip mall . The waitstaff was friendly and not pushy . Aviva was excellent . The food was fresh and tasty . I would come back to eat here again ( and skip breakfast ) .<->1
The BEST breakfast I ever ate ! ! ! Soooooo GOOD ! ! ! My family enjoyed everything . The service was AWESOME ! ! !<->1
Decent sandwich . Reminds me a bit of JJ 's but not as fast . We walked over one night since we stayed at the hotel next door . It was so convenient .<->2
Jane ... slow ... inattentive ... and blatantly uncaring . The restaurant was very slow yet it was 45 minutes after we ordered before our food arrived . Then the order was incorrect . Very disappointing visit .<->0
This was my first time at The Cracked Egg , the staff is very friendly , the owners are personable and the restaurant is clean . The food is amazing and the portion size is huge . Definitely plan on going back .<->1
Pretty sad . I can honestly say this is top ten worst burger joint I have been to . The bread stale . Fries are tiny shoe string greaseballs . Burger grease is unbarable . Banana milk shake is awefull just artificial flavoring .<->0
The food was good but they did n't give me a biscuit with my box order ... I was really looking forward to eating that too ... Update : they stole my credit card Information stay away ! ! !<->0
Under new ownership ... The already awesome gyros taste better than ever and so does the baklava ! One of my favorite restaurants and I can walk to it !<->1
The best gelato in AZ ! Doc is the nicest owner you 'd ever want to meet . His passion and creativity make this place really special .<->1
Just tried this place out . Glad we did . We had their ice dessert with fruit . The fruit was very fresh . Service was great ! Will definitely come back for more .<->1
Warm friendly place full of locals in the morning . This " old time " cafe will make anything you want for breakfast . Sheila is always accommodating .<->1
The 30 $ chef choice of sushi should be the sushiA dinner it 's nothing special just over priced average sushi 12pieces is like 25 $ - . -<->0
The food was great . We ordered the Pad Thai and it was great ! The service was excellent , and the waitress was very polite and friendly .<->1
pretty cool joint . food was good , drinks were good . nice lounge areas . definitely a great spot !<->1
The owner is so nice ! The popcorn is great and every time I 'm in Vegas or driving through I now make a point to stop in and get a couple bags .<->1
Great way to finish our Spring Break . Greasewood Flat is always a must stop for our family during visits to Scottsdale . Ca n't beat the green chili cheeseburger and cold beer !<->1
I like them for breakfast best , they know how to scramble an egg without browning it !<->2
I had over cooked rice in my burrito and I received a messed up order as well I did n't want sour cream on my other burritos . But other than that I have no complaints .<->0
Best Sushi in Vegas IMHO ! Service is great sushi is even better . They have around 90 different sushi rolls you can order with outrageous names . If you are craving sushi and have not been this is difinitely worth a drive<->1
A grilled cheese extravaganza . A great college eating spot with an amazing beer selection . A definite find<->1
My first experience with Afghan food . Loved it . Fast service and generous portions . I would highly recommend giving this place a try .<->1
The Mac and cheese burger was fantastic . I highly recommend it ! The service was attentive and the restaurant has a cool beachy vibe<->1
Best place in Leslieville . Creative food , wonderful drinks and great ambiance .<->1
You have to order the wagyu tartare . Awesome service , awesome ingredients , and the fusion aspect of their preparation make this a must try .<->1
Great place . Especially when they play music . Just often hard to get a decent place to sit , since its so popular .<->1
The food here is absolutely delicious ! I would highly recommend their thai green curry ( has a nice spicy kick to it ) , and the pad thai is worth a try as well . Unfortunately , the service is incredibly , incredibly slow .<->1
Clean store , nice staff , quick service and tasty slices ! I recommend this place to others and will definitely coming back<->1
Best ever of its kind the ambiance was nice the bisque was amazing as expected snd the mussels were Devine I love the house sauce they use i tasted it in both dishes<->1
They were very kind and kept checking on us throughout the entire meal ! The fried spam musubi is amazing , and their food is extremely delicious and filling .<->1
The cupcakes were so amazing . We had 6 total , 4 different flavors ... the Apple Pie was my favorite , followed by the Carrot cake . Highly recommended , and a huge boost for the area in terms of baked goods .<->1
Wow factor on flavor .. bigtime .. we had Reuben w / fresh cut fries ... and Lake Erie breaded fried perch on a delicious brioche bun w / fries .. oh , btw corned beef was super duper tender ... and again very flavorful . .<->1
I think this place is over - rated and you can get steaks just as good for alot cheaper . They did have an adorable little chocolate mousse filled in a rich chocolate shaped store front .<->2
Love this McDonald 's ! The staff is always very friendly and efficient and the food is always fresh ! The inside is always clean . If I am stopping at McDonald 's - I will go out of my way to go to this location ! !<->1
Yummy ! ! Well worth the drive ( we came from the East Valley ) . Clean inside and friendly staff . Big portions and super delish ! We will be back .<->1
Now called Hafez -- this is by far the best Persian restaurant in Nevada . Try their Tadig with two stews --- awesome ! Also their lamb chops are great !<->1
Great food . Randy and Tammy are the best servers ever , I 'd ask for them for an even better experience but all around a great restaurant regardless . Friendly staff , always clean :)<->1
Absolutely inedible . Wish zi could get my money back ! So expensive and so disappointing .<->0
Never again . Far too expensive for the small selection of sub - par food .<->0
Just realized upon check - in that MGM is now charging guests for self parking $ 8 a day and $ 13 for valet . This will be my last time ever staying at an MGM property .<->0
Had the Philly cheesy steak on a busy Sunday . Took awhile , it was good but not great . About 6 hours later the fun started . Woke up with food poisoning . Never eating here again .<->0
Thanks great food Superb sandwiches and friendly service . Quality meats and sides like this place<->1
We love Taco Bell . This location is great and easy to get in and out . We love ordering through the app .<->1
I love their cheese cake , .. to death . Most of what I have tried from the menu is very good as well , even tho it is a chain , certainly give it a try .<->1
What can I say ... I love Starbucks ! This location had a very large in door seating area . It is also located in a great little square of shops , attractions and even fountains ! What more could you want :)<->1
The great feature of this location is that it is open 24 hours a day . Contains most standard offerings as other Sobeys . It 's great in a pinch . 4/5 *<->1
Best Gluten Free Burger and fries we 've ever had ! ! Fast service & friendly . Delicious .<->1
Nice place overall . The ordering and staff can be a bit quirky , but the atmosphere is kind of fun .<->1
No management present . Cleanliness and repairs are not up to Fuddruckers standards . They do n't appear to be booking parties at this location .<->0
I had the Reuben it did n't come with a pickle and the bread was not toasted , the ingredients were good quality and tasted fine , the preparation was the opposite .<->0
Great addition to the Las Vegas food culture . Lomo Saltado on a bun , outstanding ! Salchipapas for the kids ( sausage and fries ) . Come check this place out !<->1
Great food in a spot that s easy to drive straight past such a great restaurant . Fab outdoor patio , too . Meatballs in particular were delicious !<->1
The Marlene Dietrich of restaurants : arrogant , overrated , more foam than substance . Should be called Toque ? Avoid<->0
The leafy green produce here is crap . The meats & chicken have lots of fat tucked underneath and very pricey .<->0
While the food was decent the lights went out . Ca n't afford to pay the power bills ? ! ? ! # cantpaytherent<->0
Everyone enjoyed their meals today ! We got burgers , chicken salad with grilled green chilies , chicken nuggets , fries and all kinds of crazy pops ! The nuggets are homemade . Felt like my Granny was cooking in the back ! Delicious !<->1
The French toast was the best I every had . Bacon thick crispy and delicious ! Service was good . We were a party of 5 satisfied customers<->1
My wife had the turkey dinner soup ... or something like that . She LOVED it , gravey broth , vegtables , a stuffing ball and cranberries . My chicken dish ... mulberry somoetjing ... sorry.was tasty and so filling . the staff was great .<->1
What a great find ! Huge value ! Fabulous food ! So glad we found this place ! We will be back for sure !<->1
Came to try their $ 5 buck lunch box ... I will sick to just their ice cream because the food was not good .<->0
Hands down THE BEST lattes in the city . Kawa you have ruined me for all other coffee joints . I 'm in love with your free wifi and your fun / chic environment .<->1
Chatime is finally open in Las Vegas ! ! The best thing is there are no line ups at this location . They have all sorts of flavors and toppings to choose from .<->1
Ordered to go , got the fried rice and beef and pork belly skewers . And maybe I ordered the wrong thing but the fried rice was very bland . The skewers we okay . Just not very flavorful . It was a miss for me .<->0
So tasty . I had the potato and cheese pierogies and a quart of haluski to go . So delish . Made 4 meals out of it ! Ca n't wait to try more flavors . And ! The staff was super friendly .<->1
Love this place ! I try to eat here every time I 'm in Vegas . The atmosphere is great , the drink selection is awesome , and the food is rediculously fantastic .<->1
Love this place for a breeze in lunch and go . the thom yum is amazing !<->1
French toast hard , had to use my knife with force . Never had scrambled eggs flat and perfectly round . They were not fluffy or tasty . Wo n't go back I 've had better<->0
Great service . The nachos were amazing . Everything you 'd expect Guy Fieri 's restaurant to be !<->1
Just a great place , with fun knowledgeable staff , and a fantastic selection ... say yes to the baked apple cider !<->1
The service was horrible , did n't bring refills at all did n't bring the check at all we had to hunt her down . Felt invisible frankly<->0
Always quick wait time , incredible pizza ! Length of line may scare you , but know it moves pretty quick ! And you get UNLIMITED toppings ! So Fresh , so good ! Best pizza joint in the Tukee in our opinion !<->1
Been going here for a while . Oliver runs an amazing café . Food is amazing . Employees are amazing . Coffee is illy , so ... you guessed it , amazing . Love this place . Try the quiche , you wo n't regret it . :)<->1
I love this place I go everyday for gas and fresh backwoods and once a week to wash my car .. good people good vibes ! !<->1
This place has amazing carne sada tacos . The salsa is exquisite and spicy ! A little pricy for a Mexican joint but well worthy our money<->1
Friendly staff , good food but a little on the expensive side for dinner . Try lunch instead .<->2
Loved the coconut soup . A must have ! ! ! Yummy . Just loved this place . Came to celebrate birthday and will definitely return .<->1
I like this place . The staff was very nice and friendly . The food was super fresh and very tasty . Overall , it was good experience . I would definitely come back there .<->1
We stopped for a drink at the upstairs bar and tried a couple specialty drinks that were delicious . Bartender was very friendly and we 'd stop there again . Did n't try any food , but it looked great coming out of the kitchen .<->1
Awesome beer selection ! Tons of rotating seasonals . The whole staff was great , especially our server , Denise . Ideal atmosphere to watch the fights .<->1
Food was what I expected at this type of establishment . Very kid friendly atmosphere and menu . Burger , fries , soups , shakes and traditional American meals make up the menu .<->2
This food court spot is probably the best you 'll find at pacific mall . The noodles are handmade and its amazing . For $ 5.99 there is n't anything else that compares . Must try !<->1
First time having Indian food , was a great first impression :) The lamb tikka masala was delicious<->1
Best Thai food hands down . They 're yummy and have good portions as well . The staff is always polite and ensure that you receive good service , whether it be ordering take or or dining in . Highly recommend them ! ! !<->1
Very friendly and courteous team at this location ! Try the cheesesteak with mushrooms onions and peppers ! The best ! And great convenient location ..<->1
Michael gave us exceptional service . We truly enjoyed our experience ! Thank you so much !<->1
Amazing service ! Our waitress heather was so helpful and friendly ! We will definitely be back soon ! !<->1
Excellent food and a always friendly staff . My personal favorite being the arizona burger . With cripsy jalapeños and lettuce and vibrant tomotoes and onion you can tell they are using high quality ingredients .<->1
Oh the pie who loved me ! Who in their right mind does not love cold stone creamery ? . the only problem I can see is that I can actually hear myself getting fatter . = - (<->1
Good stuff . Good wine . Great staff . Only wish they had small bites of every meal ... except salad cause that 's dumb . Just paninis and snacks . But seriously , always such a nice experience<->1
What I got : 12 " Cheesesteak with extra peppersPros : the sandwich was great . The mixture of cheese , peppers and steak worked well together . Cons : the beef steak was a tad bit dry . The cheese made up for the lack of moisture .<->1
Eh ... A TV dinner would have been more satisfying . Slow service and the food all seemed like it came out of a box I 'm the freezer . Not worth the price .<->0
Wow ! ! Great food and super nice staff . Great selection of drinks , great weekly specials and ample portions . I will definitely be a return customer !<->1
Diego Pops is a beautifully designed restaurant with amazing food that mixes traditional Mexican dishes with gourmet creativity and flare . Add beautifully crafted cocktails and excellent service and it is guaranteed to be a perfect experience .<->1
Good food . Nice atmosphere . I 've been here a couple of times . Tried their nachos , tacos and pomegranate salad . All very delicious .<->2
This place exciting to be with all my friends , especially with the music selection and the room sizes . They have very affordable prices so we will be coming here next time again !<->1
Ca n't beat a Nathan 's hot dog . :-) paid about $ 10.00 for a combo . Very good and split between two .<->1
The food was mediocre at best . The spinach dip was tasteless . The Bacon cheese fries had canned cheese . The patty melt was n't grilled . About the only thing they could n't ruin was the bottled beer , which was awesome . The service was excellent .<->0
The food and drinks are blah , but the service is always great ! Happy hour and trivia are always fun at Skip & Jan 's .<->2
Le Chalet was super good . The crepes are varied & filled with yummy deliciousness . And to top it off the waiter was oober cute .<->1
Best burrito place . My husband and I go there frequently . It 's the only place that makes their burritos spicy enough . Plus I think it 's much better then burrito boyz .<->1
Great service , wonderful food , and the nicest people working here ! Too bad there is not a place like this in Columbus . I would eat here everyday if I could ! !<->1
This place is AMAZING ! I 'm always in here grabbing a slice or a pie for dinner . also the WINGS ARE juicy and crispy ! All around the best pizzeria in Las Vegas !<->1
we got the vegan option delivered and it was excellent . fresh , tasty , definitely worth the price<->1
No complaints here . Groupon has a $ 79 deal for 2 pitchers of Sangria and 8 tapas . Ceviche apple salad and calamari were muy bueno .<->1
I love this place , they should open a location on the West side of Phoenix then I could enjoy their food on a more consistent basis ! I Love It !<->1
Good Eggs Benedict . Coffee not good - please clean the coffee maker ! Cinnamon roll was not good - it 's fried in too much butter and not enough sugar and cinnamon Also ladies restroom broken toilet and towel dispenser .<->2
Nice people , good customer service . A bit cramped dinning area , but great dogs . Really enjoyed it<->1
Excellent Hueos Rancheros .. Toast and Other Breakfast Specials . But the highlight was the Customer Service ! ! Absolutely floored by the Service .. 5 Stars ! Thank You People<->1
Now with their own roasted " Pig Iron " espresso and French pressed coffee ... Lit is still the best .<->1
The best kimchi place since i ve been here in america .. they have food the korean food that i really like . I will go back to this place .<->1
We went for lunch this Saturday and the sushi was delicious . Well made and all that we asked came to the table . Great AYCE sushi place ! Will definitely go back !<->1
1 . Too dark , had to use phone light to read the menu , could not see food while eating . 2 . Overpriced . 3 . Flier Mignon was super dry and bland .<->0
- Clean restaurant - Good food - Great prices - Nice serviceGreat place for breakfast ! I recommend : - Greek omelette with home fries , toast and coffee . ( $ 9 ) and - Saussages , scrambled eggs , toast and coffee ( $ 9 )<->1
The staff was nicely attentive . The sushi was well made and came at a nice pace . Unfortunately the cigarette smoke and noise from the nearby slots seriously detracted from our enjoyment of the meal and companionship<->2
Eleuterio , our beautiful bartender , made us custom drinks ! Service was awesome ... highly recommend heading to the outside area for dinner . Excellent atmosphere and great service !<->1
Best mexican in gastonia . We seem to eat here once a week . Great service , large portions and the food is delicious !<->1
One of my favorite places in Ballantyne ... I 'd highly recommend the corn bread and shrimp and grits . Great staff and nice bar and dining room .<->1
Not much to say since this is a standard super center with a large selection and a grocery store however the staff here is always helpful .<->1
Great service and sandwich . I love their bread and how fresh they are . I wish they had Pepper to put on the sandwich but other than that it was great .<->1
Go here now ! ! Best Mexican food in Vegas . Servers are very kind . They never screw my order . Food is the best .<->1
Wow ! Who knew Vegas had Malaysian food . We had been craving it and the Roti Canai and Rendangs satisfied those cravings . Very friendly service .<->1
Very polite and nice service . My first time thai foods experience so ca n't judge too much but ok .<->1
Always hot , always good and always delivered super fast . No mistakes on orders and portions are large !<->1
This place is tragic . Ordered / paid @ 6:48 . Now 7:17 still no food . Cashier said cook was busy & so was the manager . Unacceptable !<->0
One of the nicer places Tempe has to offer . They have a nice outside patio where you can bring your dogs . Food is good and unique . Nice vibe throughout the place .<->1
Delish ! ! ! Tried this place after doing some afternoon shopping and so glad I did ! The Gyros salad is so yummy . Love the gyro meat and the tizzikki sauce is awesome !<->1
One of the top sushi restaurants in the area . A little pricey but the rolls are big and delicious . Definitely worth it .<->1
Good food but much smaller portions than any other tapas restaurant I 've ever been to . So if you 're starving be prepared to order and spend lots . Our waiter Ernest was great too .<->1
Delicious ! ! And the staff was great ! Only negatives be is I wish I had a real fork and knife . But that 's just a preference will definitely go again .<->1
Pro : - A m a z i n g food and I 'm a snob - Zero wait time the four times I 've visited - Attractive finish / designCon : - Lil loud for my oldish ears - Very pleasant service , just slower than I fancyBottom line : Excellent<->1
I ordered a vegan burger and it taste so good , definitely going back for pancakes next time !<->1
The employees are always always so friendly ! Great service and food ! They can do a bunch of dishes gluten free which is a bonus considering I have celiac . 10/10 would recommend !<->1
Eyes rolling into the back of your head AMAZING . Literally every dish ordered was amazing , even from the most unassuming mushroom salad to the foie gras . ... can not WAIT to go back !<->1
Wow ! Customer service is amazing ! I see why they are so highly rated ! I will be back thanks again tony . I had a take out .<->1
We just tried their sausage , meatball and pepperoni Stromboli and it is by far our new favorite ! ! ! It 's a must try :) We also got an order of canolis , not a fan - we ended up throwing away .<->1
Cool vibe and excellent coffee in a great downtown Chandler location .<->1
The burgers are to die for ! I 've been here many times and never had a bad experience . Definitely try the galley boy .<->1
Great place for breakfast . They have a ton of waitresses running around to help you . Good food . Decent prices . Great atmosphere . Give them a try or keep coming back like us .<->1
Bravo ! ! ! Love this place ... Coffee , tea , and treats are delicious ! Every time we are in Las Vegas we always make several stops , It is worth the drive from the strip , tantalizing your taste buds !<->1
We went to Chutney 's for early dinner , they served very cold food and was not at all fresh . Even the service was slow .<->0
Really good ! Lamb tongue and gyro with hand made pita bread . Really good ! Hummus and dessert very good too ! Excellent service !<->1
Oh wolfpack , you beckon my return . Your crunchy / crisp hash browns just can not be replicated at home . One order supplies 2 - 3 meals for me . Freshly squeezed OJ mimosa is possible when desired .<->1
Love this place . I come here a lot in the mornings on my way to work . The staff are super friendly and fast . And totally love my smoothies !<->1
Came here with husband , he had pork balls , I had wanton soup , shrimp veggie fried rice , and a kiwi strawberry for drink . Wanton soup was amazing , fried rice a little bland but shrimp were great , will be back ! ! !<->2
I had a chicken kabob and gyro platter . Really good and Greek authentic . Nice customer service as well !<->1
Manchurian and Schezwan rice are really nice , that s what i have mostly had here so ca nt comment on other items lol<->1
I got their Vietnamese coffee and chocolate ice cream . Fantastic , would definitely stop by again<->1
I had a pancake there ... NEVER CAME SO MUCH IN MY YOUNG LIFE ! ! ! sorry the waiter had to clean up my huge load .<->1
Great taste and unique set up with a hip vibe and great wine , beer , and cocktail selection . Will be returning often !<->1
I had the blackened fish tacos ... fantastic . My wife had the chicken sliders ... fantastic . Mac & cheese balls were the best I 've ever had and the truffle fries were good , too .<->1
This place is certainly off the beaten path - we stumbled upon it after visiting Deer Lakes Park . Decent food , cozy environment and great conversation with " Beer Dave , " if you 're looking to try a new brew or two .<->1
One of the best mexican cantinas I 've been to and the service was fast ! The food was delicious and will visit again .<->1
Excellent , Excellent , Excellent ! If you want a true Philly Steak Sandwich THIS IS THE PLACE TO GO . Excellent customer service , very friendly and a clean facility .<->1
We got poor service : he would disappear for too long , my rice was room - temp , my entree was only slightly warmer , the carpets were dirty , the women 's restroom did n't have toilet paper and the men 's room had overflowing trashcans .<->0
Food was good service was bad . I liked our server Ashley nice girl , nice personality , but fails in priorities of work . She needs retraining . Other waitress I believe her name was Tara was very attentive .<->0
The only cheesesteak place I would eat , not a big cheesesteak fan but the Chipotle cheesesteak here is just awesome . :)<->1
I work at HENDERSON HYUNDAI its fast and easy.always at a great price , tastes great ... i will recommend this location to anyone .<->1
New Indian favorite in Madison ! That is saying a lot considering the surprisingly good Indian cuisine in the area . The food is perfectly spicy , varied , and flavorful . Best dosa I 've had in a while as well .<->1
Amazing tofu sandwich with an asian twist . Would have wanted it slightly bigger for the price but overall a must try sandwich shop . Flavors were excellent .<->1
Just too expensive , too rich , and it 's too bad because the cupcakes here are pretty awful . That being said , if you like Xanax and white wine , you 'll probably love Main Street Cupcakes .<->0
Lines are usually a bit long but the service is always great ! The salted caramel gelato is delish ( it 's a must try ! )<->1
It is a pricey ! But so good and guiltless in a way ! They truly get creative with their dishes and I am always satisfied . Love their juice selection as well !<->1
This is my new favourite shawarma joint . Their chicken on the rocks is delicious ! You have an option of the regular rice or spicy rice which other competitive restaurants do n't have . The taste , portion and price is unbeatable .<->1
Great thin crust Pizza , good service and great beer ... Pizza 's were not greasy and the tomatoes have a sweet taste to them . Cool interior too , a bit far for me but if I 'm downtown I generally stop here for a lie .<->1
Was not satisfied with my ice cream . It is very overpriced and definitely not worth the stop . It was well stocked I suppose . Convenient location .<->0
Delicious ! Do n't mind the drive for this place ! Had the tacos and they were so good with the red salsa !<->1
Was crowded today and waitresses were ignoring us but the host Matthew came to the rescue and gave us phenomenal service<->1
Went in Thursday for the chicken curry for dinner ... I got a stomach flu now . Which means the chicken was under cooked . Thanks .<->0
HANDS DOWN the best Pho in Phoenix ! Extremely affordable , the service is amazing . I crave this place and their spring rolls . The portions are huge and they have everything you need to customize your Pho yourself .<->1
This was an okay choice for a quick and inexpensive meal . Nothing great and some of the chicken was a little tough . But it was tasty and filling .<->2
Amazing service and even better food . The food was authentic Szechuan and I will definitely be back the next time I am in Vegas ! Totally worth the trip off the strip for this place !<->1
This place is to expensive I got a quesadilla and burritos of Asada the meat was all burn ! ! ! and I got 5 tacos of Asada 2 drinks spend over $ 50<->0
Just about the worst service ever . We took a good 10 min trying to flag someone down to give them our order . The waitresses were just standing there chatting with the kitchen staff and laughing the whole time .<->0
The food is amazing place is clean and great service ! We have been there few times for dinner always satisfied !<->1
What a surprise ! My students wanted to go here for lunch while at the AZ SkillUSA Championship . Imagine my delight when I discovered how good the food was . We were served by the owner , too .<->2
Quite gem hidden in China Town . Food is good and priced well for Vegas . Definitely on the list of must visit when in Vegas .<->1
I was n't a huge fan of the food , but this is one of my favorite places to watch football . You can see any game you want at any location in the place .<->1
Rude staff , great food , big location with lots of seating . Not much to say as I 've been to multiple bboyz locations but this one has the worst customer service .<->2
Great prices , great atmosphere , great prices on drinks and food and freshly renuvated . Wants to party ? Come here ! !<->1
I had a chocolate milk shake , houston burger , and bacon cheese fries . I thought I was going to have a stroke , but it was delicious .<->1
terrible brought half our order then tried to tell me to pay other half when it came spoke to manager and he was rude dismissive and did not care about what happened ! ! ! never will again order from them IGNORANT ! ! !<->0
The steaks here are excellent ! The service is good too . A great steak wo n't cost you $ 50 + here either . This is my Favorite Steakhouse in LV .<->1
If I could give 0 stars I would . ... Food not cooked right , not corrected , service poor ... Management duh !<->0
hig quality food for a bar ... this is an upscale palce , but prefect to get a drink and a bite before a game at the BOB or the basketball arena ... not too expensive for the quality of food you get .<->1
By far the BEST greek salad i have ever had ! Food is so fresh and tastes sooo good ! The waitress went above and beyond making my salad and serving me . Thank You !<->1
Awful experience with my family , the pizza and adult beverages at best 1 star . Very hostile servers , what a dump . DO NOT EAT HERE ! ! ! You would be sorry too .<->0
Fantastic place for breakfast . An assortment of items on the menu that male it tough to decide what to order . Candice is over the top with her service .<->1
Do n't do it ! Extremely harsh , not polite , Mean older male taking the orders at the front counter - could be the owner . Started off w the wrong order , Bland food , watery dipping sauce , who knows what s in the spring rolls .<->0
Awesome beer selection including decent beer hall food . Will definitely recommend going there ones in Toronto .<->1
awsome delicious food . great service.must try the strawberry lemonade it is like a slushie<->1
This place means business , strong smell of roasted coffee in the air , people eating late night snacks , a great selection of anything java or non java to tempt your senses !<->1
We stop in every morning when home for vaca . They take debit / credit just to correct the last review . Eggs Benedict , 3.99 ... Come on that 's a great price , especially for medina ! I love it ! ! !<->1
Just does n't get better than viva mercados . Best service , great ambiance , and amazing food .<->1
Teppan was just okay ... had to wait awhile for Teppan chef to come ... miso soup was nasty and dressing for salad which I normally love was just okay ... sushi order got mixed up and almost got someone else 's sushi ...<->0
Quality restaurant hidden here in Fort Mill / Indian Land . I enjoyed a fresh local seafood entree with seasonal vegetables . Very affordable with great service and local atmosphere . I will be back !<->1
BEST . STREET . TACOS . Great little hole in the wall authentic taco shop . The barbacoa beef is so delicious , juice , spicy , and tender . Definitely looking forward to returning and trying more !<->1
They are so kind here . And the food is so good . My favorite has to be the tacos de Camarón .<->1
3/5 ! Great place for birthdays or group gatherings ! I recommend the sliders and pouting spring rolls ! I am not a huge fan of pub food - but if that is your thing - definitely check this place out .<->2
Holy cow ! It was freezing cold in this place this morning ! One of the baristas was wearing a scarf .<->0
Grey Gardens is a terrific new restaurant in Toronto ! Delicious and creative food ! Loved sitting at the Chef 's Counter watching the dishes being prepared . Very lively atmosphere . Service was very friendly and attentive !<->1
Line sucks and can be long even late at night , but the pan roast is worth it .<->1
Wonderful food ! Great atmosphere . Great choices for dairy free and gluten free meals . Wonderful salads , soups , and steak !<->1
Favorite place to stop on my way home from downtown . Just like the tacos u get on the streets in mexico city . But better quality beef .<->1
Nice food , I love their chicken wings most , but pretty much everything taste nice .<->1
Great tasting pizza and affordable . Recommend you split the pie , with someone cause it 's huge ! ! !<->1
We can hardly avoid this place because of the kids . They know when we come to the drive thru sometimes twice on Saturdays . We get great service and the fries are always hot .<->1
Really good food , especially the Laksa with beef . Service okay , not a fancy place at all . Definitely worth it .<->1
I LOVE this place ! The turtle sundae is so so good . Every part of it tastes amazing . I love the saltiness of the pecans with the ice cream and sauce . I crave these and wish it was closer to home !<->1
Food was fine but the service was GREAT ! Thank you to Dwayne , the best server at Bone Fish Grille ! He was very attentive and engaging . We will be back !<->1
There hooka is not that good but their happy hour menu is cheap and good . I love the chicken finger , hummus and their calamari . The ambiance is great depending which server u have the service differers . I<->2
Happy hour is gold ... $ 10 each for s sushi platter for two , kobe beef sliders , dim sum , chicken lettuce wraps , and calamari ... yummm ! Plus I got to drink my girly drinks - strawberry caipirinha and purple haze :)<->1
It used to be a Port of Subs . The menu is similar and so is the sandwich prep counter . They also feature smoothies , coffee , and now rolling ice cream . Friendly staff . I recommend it .<->1
Okay food . Okay selection . Awful attitudes from the waitresses , almost as if we were an inconvenience . May go there again .<->0
Reasonably priced , authentic , Cantonese Chinese cuisine . Friendly service . Pictures of Hongkong decorate the walls . Noodles and chicken dishes always tasty . A midtown Phoenix find ! I 've never ordered the American - style dishes .<->1
Had Salmon with asparagus and capers . Fresh fish , lovely preparation . Pizza was good too . No complaints !<->1
Love to meet family here , it 's like A family picnic under the big huge trees . The outdoor grounds and gardening is beautiful . When the weather is nice in Arizona ... coming here is a must do ! !<->1
Absolutely the BEST Lobster Roll in Cleveland ! ! If you like lobster rolls you must try this place . It 's going to cost you but it 's with it .<->1
Visiting Red Rock Canyon today and thanks to all The great Yelp reviews we found this place . Best pizza I have ever eaten . Fresh basil , crispy crust , delicious !<->1
Drinks are well - crafted and much detail goes into each one . Perfection in a glass . The staff is very friendly , and the happy hour is a fantastic deal ! A must do in Scottsdale .<->1
Jonathan was awesome ! Best staff in town . Thanks for the soy sausage in my omelette .<->1
Check out Happy Hour . 3 - 5 Monday thru Friday . Barrio Bomba drink and White Sangria are amazing .<->1
The hands down slowest drive thru window in the known universe . Employees move at the speed of frozen syrup .<->0
Great place for breakfast . Good portion sizes and great prices for Vegas . Our waiter , Arnold , was very attentive and made sure we had everything we needed . Highly recommend .<->1
Consistently great service and good food . It is a bit loud but people have fun here<->1
This place is delicious . Great food and when they cook in front of you they do a lot of cool tricks and stuff . I would eat there everyday if I could afford it .<->1

Best place in Charlotte for authentic and delectable French treats ! ! ! Make sure to get some macaroons !<->1
The place was really cool . Ordered polenta fries , magic mushroom and a sambuca pizza . The mushroom was good . Both the pizza and fries were okay ( was nt very impressed ) . Three stars is for the ambience and service .<->2
This place is great ! Great tasting food . Spicy fried noodles with chicken is fantastic ! Try the cucumber ginger martini .<->1
Bon , frais et authentique . C'est de la bonne cuisine thai . Tenu par des thaïlandais ( c'est important :D )<->1
Love the bakery but the customer service sucks ! Maybe people need to find another job they are better at ...<->0
Nice happy hour specials . Ask the bartender for a suffering bastard ... a tasty , tasty adult beverage .<->1
Nouveau resto dans le quartier . C'est un apportez - votre - vin très honnête ( $ ) , avec une belle ambiance , qui est fréquenté par les de gens du quartier . La carte est simple et tout est bien maîtrisé .<->1
This review is n't based on anything more than the donuts . Simply put , they are the best in Phoenix . No major complaints on the coffee or other food items either . But , the donuts ... oh the donuts .<->1
the best ( and only ) " homemade ' pizza in Robinson Twp . , love the white pizza ! the red sauce is excellent also , and delivery is super fast , the people are pleasant . jus a good old local pizza place with good fresh food .<->1
Largest breakfast menu I 've ever seen and the staff are very friendly and remember us each time we go . Highly recommend this place !<->1
This place was really good . If you go , get the fried cauliflower , I crave it everyday ! We just had to wait a long time for a table , but it was still a great experience .<->1
Very friendly service . Had the grandpa skillet , which tasted bland for the most part . The chicken fried chicken was better and had much more flavor to it .<->2
great place . the decor is very modern i had the Banh - mi sandwich with pork bellit was great the bread was perfect the sandwich came with a cabbage type topping , carrots , cilantro , and jalapeño<->1
Great Fancy Bar . The service was amazing ! ! They offer some great unique food items - bone marrow for example . Their drink menu is on an ipad and is awesome . Pricey , but so is everything else in Las Vegas<->1
The food is always hot and fresh ... the service is excellent ... the only problem I have is when you order bacon on your pizza . .. they do n't put enough<->1
Luved it ! Everything we ordered was unique , bite size and tasty !<->1
I was quoted a slightly higher price for a product when cashier assumed I 'd pay cash . When I produced a credit card , the price miraculously went down . Not much of a difference but odd .<->0
OHMY GOSH IT IS SO GOOD ! ! My best Italian restaurant from now on ! Trust me and come to this place and you will be the winner<->1
To make this review authentic ... I'M SHOUTING.IT ' S TOO LOUD ! WHAT ? I CAN'T HEAR YOU IN THIS CLUB . THIS STEAK IS DELICIOUS ? WHAT DID YOU SAY ? THE OYSTERS ARE YUMMY ? HUH ? WHAT ? NEVERMIND ! ! !<->2
Cadre super sympa , idem pour le service . Un des meilleurs bars du quartier . La bouffe d'inspiration asiatique est bonne bien que pas ultra copieuse . Mon seul regret : la IPA Ste Ambroise ... ma préférence allant pour la boreale<->1
Excellent ! ! ! Excellent ! ! Service from our server Andrew . Guy was awesome , very polite and came to check on us often . Food was delicious and filling . Will be coming back real soon .<->1
The food is ok but not worth the wait , we were in line for 45 min and the line only moved half way . There ordering system is horrible , if your hungry do n't go there it will frustrate you !<->0
Best Beef Sate Pho in the south - end of Calgary . This place has become a favourite of my family 's . The food is better than the other Vietnamese restaurants in that area , the service and ambiance are average .<->1
# 34 Crispy spring roll dish was EXCELLENT ! It had little chopped up cucumbers under the noodles that were yummy . Crispy spring rolls delicious . First time here & really enjoyed it !<->1
Amazing food and great sports bar to watch games plenty of tv options . Breadsticks are the bomb and wings are good .<->1
First time on this restaurant . Inside looks clean . It 's a quiet place . This is just an ordinary Chinese restaurant so do n't expect too much .<->1
Had the tonkotsu ramen , and the broth was delicious . Prices were great as well . Service was a little below average , but it was busier than usual .<->1
High price for only so - so food . I did n't bother staying for the Flamenco dancer ... the poor atmosphere was a turn off ( large empty room , shabby decor ) . One positive : the service was friendly and responsive .<->0
Great place . Better than the more popular chain resto ( PJ ) next door .<->1
Lunch orders are 8.00 not 7.00 . Food is good ... really good . I will definitely be back .<->1
Food was really nice but quite a few empty serving bowls on the buffet , get the chicken soup made for you as it was DELICIOUS ! I thought the wine was expensive for the small thimble I got :-)<->2
This place is very authentic and SO GOOD ! I have gone twice now , and the food was very tasty both times . If you are in a big group , I recommend the Fiesta Taco platter , it comes with 16 filling tacos !<->1
Usually really good . Today I had the worst coffee I 've ever had . Tasted bitter and burnt . Might be a while before I can go back .<->0
Food was really good . They accepted the YELP discount without question . I will definately go back .<->1
Great beer selection , especially Belgian beer . I 've had better experience with the wait staff than some other reviewers . The food is only okay , but the happy hour is definitely worth it .<->1
Best wings I 've ever had . I love the mild but my sister and mom rave about the lemon pepper . Also the fried pickles are a must have !<->1
Small place , excellent food . The best food in montreal so far . Good price . Everything was fresh . I loved . Try to eat their mango cake for desert .<->1
Best hot sausage sub I have found so far . It 's a small place , family owned . Stop in .<->1
Nykki at Subway has exceptional attention to detail . She warmed up some components of my sandwich to make it more uniform and advised me of changes to available components . I have no complaints about the rest of the facility . :)<->1
If your in a hurry stay away ... Zinc burger ordered Medium well , came out Medium rare ... flat iron salad decent ... service horrible ...<->0
Awful service , food was not very appealing . Rude attitudes with the staff . Very long wait times .<->0
Kinda expensive , but the best on town , gone are Alaskan KING crab legs . :-( , crepes anyone ?<->1
Something , LoverSoul , Hurricane Rolls are delish ! Also te halibut is always good here !<->1
They fixed their bagels ! Oasis returns to its top tier bagel status . New ownership from people who really care . Believe me , it shows in their bagels and pastries . Their crumb cake in particular is incredible .<->1
Great italian food , great ambiance , great waitress / super nice services . We loved the entire experience there . The margarita pizza is quite something . Really taste like authentic italian food .<->1
Great place to get Pub food and not pay a premium . The fish and chips are huge . Chop salad had just the right amount of dressing . We liked it so much we came back three times in one week .<->1
Basic menu but food I 'd good . Restaurant can get noisy so make sure you do n't mind that type of atmosphere<->1
The coffee and scones are awesome . Sometimes you have to wait a little long because the staff is chatting .<->1
Was very disappointed . New management . One of worst pizzas I ever had . Way too much sauce . Unevenly spread . Was way cheaper on cheese than old owners . DO NOT GO . FROZEN PIZZA IS BETTER .<->0
Dropping for lunch . Food was so so at best . Tables needed to be wiped off . Overall impression was that this is a place I 'll drive past in the future .<->0
I was really impressed with the selection here . Seafood , Italian , American , Middle Eastern , salads , etc ...<->1
Authentic , local & loved by locals . Cadillac Margharita is a must - have here . We 've been going back to this place every yr during the wsop since 2010<->1
Not as good as the one in Hollywood , but it is still good in it 's own way ! Lots of hot dog choices - you pretty much ca n't go wrong !<->1
Been a fan of Rigatony 's since it opened up in it 's original location on Arizona ave , 24 years ago . Still a fan after all these years . Great authentic Italian dishes . They make you feel like family . Thank you !<->1
Needs better management .. number of staff behind the counter is usually higher than the people in line .. Need to clear out the ones who spend hours in the parking lot and even bring lawn chairs in the summer<->2
Best Thai food I 've ever had ! Love papaya salad and drunken noodle port and pineapple rice . Too bad we finished the food before we take pictures . We will come back with friends .<->1
Very stark atmosphere and a menu that 's all over the board . Not sure about this one . The Italian sausage sandwich seemed to have been microwave , chewy on the end . Service was fine .<->0
I 'm never disappointed with this spot . Food is always hot and fresh . Lord my order of bbq pork fried rice and salt n pepper wings minus the peppers are so damn good . China a go go eat your eyes out .<->1
I go a couple times a month and the spicy tofu soup is delicious ! ! The service is great and very welcoming !<->1
As a chain restaurant , the food here is decent and overall pretty good . The pizzas are freshly made and the highlight . I would recommend the Diavola and the mushroom pizza .<->2
Best . Mac . And . Cheese . EVER.No need to add bologna .<->1
Yummy jerk chicken pizza ! Good times and great food . Love coming here after church on Sundays !<->1
I think prison food is better then this placeThe food was stale and it felt like everything has been sitting for hrs<->0
Ok NY pizza . Nothing special and the service need to be updated . What kind of business does n't greet customers or say thank you . Grimaldi pizza is better and so is the service .<->2
One of the best burger stands in Las Vegas . Good service , food and atmosphere . Looking to stop in sometime soon .<->1
Nice little place tucked away in the back corner of cosmopolitan third floor .. nice pizza<->1
Meh ! Had the brunch and the limited food selection in each station is underwhelming . Quality is par at best . No impressive when vegas.com put it I . Their 10 ten :/<->0
An awesome place to kill a couple hours . I love Medievil Madness ! The local , retro pinball machines are also a fun throwback . Make sure to check out the floor when you enter .<->1
I 'm from Cali , this ish was alright but at least they had good service . Enchiladas were n't bad just was n't feeling the beans and rice . They 're chips and sauces are delicious .<->2
Food is reasonable and I love it that they 're fried rice has veggies not just fried rice and eggs very clean great service . I highly recommend this place .<->1
Excellent , family - owned business . Donuts made fresh every morning in a welcoming , hole - in - the - wall atmosphere that makes you feel at home . Great service , always with a smile !<->1
The food and atmosphere here were great . Good food to tempt every palate . I will most definitely come back . It was a delight to eat here .<->1
Fish sandwich was mushy , soggy and generally terrible . 10 minutes later had stomachache . Avoid the fish ! Lobster Roll was great .<->0
Worst Vegas buffet I 've ever eaten at for lunch . There 's hardly any desserts or side dishes . Half of the thier food was dry ( chicken , fish , turkey , etc . ) Definitely not coming back .<->0
Amazing ! ! ? ! Best food ever ! Got the snow crab and garlic butter and it was so perfect . Fun atmosphere - was packed for a Tuesday 4 pm . Definitely a new place to come to frequently ! !<->1
My boyfriend loves the sweet tea here ! Oh AND the Canes sauce is amazeballs ! ! ! Fair WARNING : it 's always busy .<->1
Nice service at the bar . Those happy hour sliders were good , but tiny ( as in 2 - 3 bites max ) . The PBJ Old Fashioned was smoothe and tasty . Their Sucker Punch drink was my fave .<->1
Unexpectedly poor experience given all the great reviews . Came in , ordered from the menu , then the kitchen took a very very long time with the food<->0
Wow they have a great hamburger now , even my wife is telling me so and she 's a salad person . I ordered mid - rare and it was perfect .<->1
What is there not to like about sauce . Our favorites are the chicken Caesar pizza and the caprese salad . Is a great option for either dine in or take out .<->1
really small portion size but it was good - fried calamari and okonomiyaki<->1
Outstanding pizza ! ! Complementi .. I 've lived in Italy and the pizza here is reminiscent . It 's way better than Grimaldis and Settebello .. Salads wonderful too . Staff was fab ! Wish I lived closer .<->1
Great awesome authentic mexican food . Great service , and very professional . Love this place .<->1
7 - 11 has better pizza and at a better price too . The sauce and cheese is n't too bad but the crust was like cardboard . Go eat at Johnie Rockets instead<->0
Amazing Taco Tuesday Deals ! ! ! The fish taco is $ 1.49 and hands down the best fish taco I have ever had ! And I LOVE tacos . Eat here ! ! !<->1
Love coming here for açaí bowls ( the best I 've tried anywhere ) and they 're fresche green juice !<->1
We go here at least once a week . The food is great , super fresh . Nice quiet atmosphere ( I hate having to yell over dinner ! ) , reasonable prices and portion sizes . Service is exemplary !<->1
Great pizza . Great location friensly staff . Def recommd to anyone by the strip . Different sizes depends on how hungry you are and the mozzarella sticks were fantastic .<->1
Good variety of European produces , I like it and I will go back , Anna makes the most delicious mici , and good in price .<->1
Pancakes were really good . Breakfast potatoes were just okay . Wouldn ' t go out of my way to eat here but it was n't bad either .<->2
This place has the best smothered pork chops in Charlotte . The customer service is great and the prices are not bad . I 've also had the fried chicken wings and they are to die for . I frequent this place often .<->1
Had a prescription called in for me . Three hours later I show up and it is n't filled . Use another pharmacy unless you enjoy waiting forever .<->0
No words . Have n't been back since they expanded , but the food is out of this world . The chimichurri sauces are unique , as is the concept . Treat yourself !<->1
Been here a couple of times now , And yes , I 'm a fan . Good food and great service .<->1
Categorically , the worst service ever . If you want to see a waiter more than once in two hours , do n't consider this joint !<->0
Good pizza but horrible service . Stopped ordering from them just because of their service . Otherwise pizza is good if you can get it delivered while it 's still hot<->2
Get the Garlic Chicken , the Red Curry , or the Tom Kha soup . Very good Thai place ( maybe the best ) in Tempe .<->1
The food was delicious ! The best meal I 've had while in Vegas ! My party had a grilled chicken salad , pulled pork sandwich , shrimp po'boy , and a burger with train wreck fries . AMAZING<->1
I love Chipotle ! Chipotle 's my life ! Every time I go to Chipotle , it 's this location . The service is excellent , the food is bomb , the place is always clean , and it 's close to my house . Good job Chipoopies !<->1
I have eaten here once and would never go back . Had breakfast ... The bacon was greasy , the potatoes were almost raw , and worst of all the coffee was COLDWould not recommend this restaurant<->0
Seriously amazing . was so completely impressed with food , service and ambiance . Truly is as good as it gets ! Getting takeout as I can ; t stop thinking about the pesto zuchinini noodles ! !<->1
the food was great , but they overcharge on delivery.they say it is free delivery , but constantly add 2.00- 3.00 $ . so enjoy the food , but check your receipt .<->0
I ordered the Cajun Combo not amazing but very tasteful it was beautifully cooked and was buttery smooth only thing I did not like was the saltiness of it but otherwise great atmosphere and wonderful crew .<->2
Awesome food . .. friendly atmosphere ... loved their Naan bread and lamb curry ... yummm<->1
Great little Thai delivery place . Fast and decent food . Usually go for beef pad kee mao and chicken pad see ew . As a bonus , they have awesome , thin shoestring fries .<->1
This place never disappoints with its great service and amazing food . Our server Victoria was amazing and so sweet . I will definitely be coming back ! :)<->1
Mon nouveau café de quartier que j'adore ! - Heures d'ouvertures intéressantes . - Belle ambiance décontractée - Très bon café - Personnel sympathique - Jolie déco - Coin " bureau " avec imprimante et autres accessoires utilesIl est possible de louer une salle privée pour travailler .<->1
Whoo ~ Hoo ! Selection : Check . Inventory : Check . Informative Staff : Check . Under - cut Prices : Check . HTF Bottles : Check . This is my new candy store - yesssssssssssssssssssssssss<->1
I was skeptical at first since this place is attached to a gas station but as life as taught me ... The hole in the wall places are the best . One of the best breakfast burritos I 've ever had .<->1
Ordered a cheese pizza and it was delicious ! ! Quick and friendly service ! ! Loved every slice I had ! Definitely a place I 'd go back to !<->1
Yum . Loved everything . So good and very reasonable , price wise ! Will eat here again every time I 'm in Vegas . The garlic prawns and crispy duck Penang are my favorite ! Great wine list too .<->1
Great ambience and killer martini . Steak was a little over done , but John was a fabulous server . On point service , and definitely knows his shit . Made dinner easy and fun . Thank you !<->1
30 minute wait on a take out order . Servers were not capable of following through with orders properly . Management team needs to step up their game and do a better job .<->0
Save yoursel time and go to the pet haircut place next door and ask them to box you up a dog treat .<->0
The gyros are genuine and the best around . Great service and the owner is an awesome guy who you can sit and talk to while you wait for your food or eat it . Does n't get better than Leena 's .<->1
Lots of portions and tastes like any other sbarro . staff was nt too friendly but they were really busy so I do nt blame them . The food is simple , but filling . mmm . I m going to eat my leftovers now . =)<->2
Great experience . The first time we came ( when it very first opened ) , it was n't great but we just wnt again and everything was deliciious ! Would definitely recommend it ! ! !<->1
Used to go here quite often as it was located at the bottom of my building . I recently checked out the location on Spadina , few menu changes and small changes to the dishes since I 've been but everything still delicious .<->1
Order Large Cheese Steak to go for some Sandwich craving and this will be the right place for it ! Got a Large free drink when I check in to the place nice very nice !<->1
Authentic homemade Mexican favorites . Tamales were outstanding and the chicken street tacos are worth coming back for .<->1
Sweet and soothing climate in location . Wonderful views of the pool from a glasshouse seating . Customer service was excellent , very helpful and attending . I would recommend the breakfast , lunch and dinner visits .<->1
Always loved the chicken from Chick - N - joy , way better than KFC<->1
I stop by and finaly try this ramen soup , is amazing :) my friend tell me about but never had time to come here and have this soup . I will come back for sure :)<->1
Best authentic Mexican restaurant on the west side of town hands down everything is delicious , another must try are the Micheladas give it a try you wo n't regret it<->1
As far as Walmart goes , this one is out dated with lackadaisical employees , and it seems to be always poorly stocked .<->0
Middle of the road . Had Chicken fried steak . It was good , hash browns cooked last week , tough and cold . Eggs warm but dry . Service good .<->2
Great Pho for super cheap . Quirky little hole - in - the - wall , with the family and kids hanging out . So cheap , I love it .<->1
First time coming here and loved the service and the food ! ! ! Salmon tacos were so good and flavorful ! ! My wife , who does n't like fish , enjoyed them . So overall super satisfied with my food !<->1
We stopped for breakfast , and had dosa and vada which my parents liked it , I 'm happy for that .<->1
Hot and ready ? Haha nope . 20 min wait . Every . Single . Time . Not to mention their crazy bread seemed a bit doughy ... I still ate it tho .<->0
The place was very clean and the cashier super friendly . She greeted me with a nice big friendly smile and took my order right away . My food arrived very quick and it was super fresh . 5 stars w / o a doubt .<->1
Love the selection . Yes it is a little disorganized but what Asian market is organized that is n't Japanese ? Smells better than some worse than others . Love the fresh made dishes at checkout . Only wish they had better / more fresh veggies .<->1
Sa ? l ? k için geldi ? i m bu otelde 45 in güleryüzlü ikramlar ? çok güzel yemekleri leziz hele ekmekleri Türkiyemin ekmeklerini hiç aratmad ? burdaki personele koçaman te ? ekkür ..<->1
Best nail salon in Las Vegas ! I get my nails done by Jackie . She 's the absolutely the best . The salon is so nice and comfortable . The nail color options seem endless . Go by and they will treat you very well .<->1
Kickass Mexican food and fun atmosphere .<->1
Small mom and pop restaurant , good service , and decent prices .<->1
Quick service and delicious food ! Ca n't beat that ! Also quaint little place with pretty authentic Japanese decor . Wished they played Japanese music tho instead of top 10 R & B - it would really transform the whole dining experience .<->1
This place is amazing ! Great food amazing service ! The staff treated my sister and I like family . Discovering this hidden gem on Mill made our night ! Had amazing hookah , food and people . If your out on Mill check it out !<->1
This is my favorite BWW to go to . Mike & Jessica are awesome . I love sitting by the bar during happy hour ( great deals ) & delicious food . They 're boneless teriyaki wings are so good omg , to die for ! ! !<->1
Iv been to all of them , and they are pretty much the same ... bomb but being open 24/7 gets 10/5 stars ! And service has always been good !<->1
My husband and mom really liked this place ! My mom commented on the creativity of the hotdogs . My husband found the hotdogs very tasty . The only real seating is outdoors , though , so be prepared for the weather .<->1
Great gyros and the combo platter is really good $ 3.00 gyro Tuesday 's love the skin on french fries<->1
Ordered take out from the vegetarian menu , everything was delicious and the service was so fast<->1
The interior is adorable ! There are so many good desserts to choose from and they 're all presented beautifully . I especially loved all of the unique ice cream flavors to choose from .<->1
This is my go to restaurant in the city ! I probably visit this restaurant once a month and without a doubt they never disappoint ! Also , the pricing is very very good for the quality of food .<->1
Great coffeeSuper helpful and cute staff great recommend coffee This was my first time here got the snickers . I will come back many times justNot from this side of town hopefully more will appear near Tempe and chandler .<->1
Expensive and very small portions . Thankfully , bread and butter were good and abundant . I will definitely not go back .<->0
Wide selection of good looking cupcakes . My daughter always gets something chocolate and fun . My wife loves the Vegan Red Velvet . Yumminess in her mouth ! ! The staff is knowledgeable and very friendly . Love coming here !<->1
Meh ... Would not come here on my own dime . If you do come the service is good and food is ok . Price is just a bit too high . Nice location<->2
This cafe is one of the first places we visited after moving to the neighbourhood . I love it ! The coffee drinks are glorious , prices are fair , seating is cozy , baristas friendly ... this place is the real deal .<->1
Absolutely excellent sushi ! The sushi chefs are super friendly and make great conversation with the people at the bar . Would highly recommend .<->1
I 'm hooked . The chicken is tender , the crinkle fries are amazing and the sauce is the best part . Definitely give this place a try if you 're in the area and looking for some food .<->1
when you have twenty open tables you should seat people . I know being in charge of seating is a very heady position , but you not so important . get over yourself .<->0
Food is Excellent , wait and bar staff top notch . I just do n't get the hostess team , horrible . A 20 min wait for a table outside when there are 8 tables available ? ? ?<->2
Good food , there seems that the employee 's were out on the outside deck and drinking . That would be a great place to work . I hope no one gets a Dui on the way home<->1
There is a bar ! ! ! The nicest bar tenders are there . You can sample new beers and wines or order full glasses . They even have a happy hour .<->1
Food and service was perfect . The wings are double dusted and really good . The ribs with apple butter sauce is amazing .<->1
Does not take Amex . Would help if this was on their website .<->0
I am a regular at this spot . Past two visits the food quality was poor . Yesterday their relish was stale . The quality and service has dropped significantly in past 6 months or so .<->0
Been coming here for years . The best Cuban food in the city . You ca n't go wrong with anything on the menu . My favorite is the Lechon Asado . The staff is very friendly and always nice . You wo n't be disappointed .<->1
Great food overall . The lady working there is extremely nice . I would have given them 5 stars however it did take them a while to get the sandwiches out to us .<->1
I have been to CC many times and have never been disappointed . The lobster bisque and steak christopher are fantastic . Great ambiance with attentive and pleasant wait staff .<->1
The red pozole is really good ! ! ! It comes with a piece of chicharrón on the side . The chilles rellenos are also really good . Authentic Mexican food is the best ! !<->1
I try to go here at least once every 2 weeks for lunch . Amazing food and customer service . Highly recommend the carnitas burrito !<->1
I love Little Caesars but do n't come to this location on Val Vista and Southern if you 're starving or in a hurry . It requires patience . If their cheese bread were n't so addicting I 'd probably just go somewhere else ...<->0
Great service from Swade and John . Helpful answering questions about the menu . Really yummy tacos and drinks .<->1
Quick stop on the road , really did nt want the usual chain restaurant fare . OMG , the food was awesome ! Fresh , quick , tasty , healthy , and inexpensive , does nt get any better !<->1
Came here twice for the chicken BLT poutine and have enjoyed it the two times . The poutines seem to be the thing to order , at this place . Do n't deviate poutine will not dissapoint .<->1
Very good quality Sushi for an all you can eat deal . Very much enjoyed my meal there ! Highly recommend !<->1
Love love love Rubios . All food is always fresh delicious . Best place for healthy alternatives quickly . Excellent service super friendly<->1
After 1600 reviews and a 4 1/2 star average rating , I 'm not sure what else I can add ... All I have to say is , this place is Legit .<->1
Good stop for a quick , relatively healthy lunch . The salad entree comes with guacamole but some entrees do not . Beware : small side of guacamole is $ 2.00 . This location is usually extremely busy on weekdays between 11 am and 1 pm .<->1
This place offers a goos variety of food at a decent price . I was underwhelmed by the greasy boneless rib appetizer and the pepper chicken entrée . But the fried dumplings and green beans are excellent !<->2
One of the best pizzas in the area . Traditional red or white pizzas are both excellent choices . Salads are good too .<->1
The best every time ... I order delivery every week and still no complaints just loving this Chinese food OMFG ...<->1
Great diner food and service . Fried okra , big waffle , iced coffee , and biscuits and gravy :)<->1
The lunch spicy pork bento box was excellent ! Surprised at the large quantity but pleased .<->1
My dad had the corned beef hash and i got the country fried steak skillet . They are both delicious . Will definitely come back here .<->1
My favorite BBQ joint in Charlotte . Excellent pulled pork , friendly staff . A great place to introduce your family / friends to some real Eastern NC BBQ .<->1
Open 24 hours ! Family friendly . The food my table ordered was good . Wish I had known it was there last night !<->1
Yum ! Love this new hangout at downtown Summerlin . The only thing I have n't really cared for was the French Fries ... Five Guys is my place for those '<->1
Where else can you pick your own cookies and ice cream combo for $ 2 . Amazing soft cookies and delicious ice cream !<->1
This is the worst supermarket in the Plateau . Terrible service , miserable employees , empty shelves , etc ... Just go elsewhere . ALL the employees look like they 'd rather be dead than helping customers . Why ca n't we rate ZERO on yelp ?<->0
Very nice brunch setting , I ordered the pancakes , felt like something was missing though ... Would have paired perfectly with 3 eggs and potatoesOverall good visit , would likely come back<->1
Love the purple rice , Philadelphia roll is superb , the seaweed salad is delectable , and the staff is very friendly !<->1
Very attentive service . Simple traditional food . The waiter noticed my Bills T Shirt and turned on the game for me . Very accommodating and we 're grateful .<->1
Great happy hour food and drinks ! ! love the prime rib ! ! Cozy cabin atmosphere makes you feel like you 're not in vegas !<->1
Really liked this place . Had a great wine selection and the food was fantastic . Had the sous vide pork flank , was delicious . Ambiance was very nice and staff were great . Would definitely go back if I was local .<->1
Everything was excellent and this is my first 5 star review ! I m usually a tough cookie . The food was excellent . Jose , our server , was attentive and pleasant . Coming here again soon . Every dish was outstanding .<->1
Delicious ! Boba is fresh and drinks are addicting . I love that you can customize the sweetness . Prices are also super reasonable . My new favorite boba place !<->1
Great place for after work drinks ! ! ! Went with my team last Friday for drinks and apps and will be going back again tomorrow !<->1
Worth the hype ! This is where you go to get quality Italian food ! There s not a thing on their menu that disappoints !<->1
Unbelievable ; have been waiting to find the right Thai , finally did . The Tom Ka Gai soup was over the top , the owner and staff were mingling and wonderful and great ambassadors of Downtown Scottsdale - - best Thai in the valley<->1
Lots of food , high quality , worth . Came here with a party of 3 and the premium meant for 2 served us well !<->1
The burger was pretty disappointing for the price . Coleslaw was tart , patties are paper thin , very greasy . Order was fast . Fries are good .<->0
Food was amazing ... server was on point and had the best personality ... came to checknon n us when we needed him to did n't have to wait long for anything ... strawberry lemonade is delicious fyi .<->1
The meat was great , but the servers made us feel uncomfortable . Constantly trying to upsell .<->1
Disappointed . Probably a comfort food place reminding of your mom 's omelet ? Sadly , it did n't appeal to me . But I would n't say it 's bad . Just an okay place . Truly believe this place is overrated .<->2
The online menu for this specific location has a gluten - friendly section which includes alfredo , yet when I ordered this , I was told that they could not make it gluten free . Very disappointed .<->0
The bartender tonight was a condescending prick . He talked down to everyone at the bar except for 2 girls that were poster children for plastic surgery . This guy needs to go<->0
We had a rest experience . The food was actually very good . My whitefish and wife 's salmon were tasty . Too bad we missed daylight to enjoy the scenery .<->1
Came here around noon on a Sunday . Pros : - Seating available - Quick service Cons : - Average pizza - Pricey<->2
Nicely decorated and comfortable seating . Servers very friendly and knowledgeable ! Really like their wine selection - common favourites that you would recognize . Meals were tasty and well prepared .<->1
Everything are over $ 20 , not worth it at all , my girlfriend were so disappointed by the food they offered . Worst spicy pork bone soup ever . And the bogo go is also really bad and it 's 17 dollars ! ! !<->0
Got a salmon bento box , salmon was paper thin ( see attached picture ) Tempura was soggy by the time we got home because they failed to puncture the box to prevent it from getting soggy . Amateurs ...<->0
It was fast they had great customer service ! And it was so packed in their but everything came out so good and fresh<->1
This place is FANTASTIC . The food comes in big portions and the quality is amazing . The service is also some of the best I 've ever experienced ! 10/10 will come back again .<->1
Great fresh full of flavor chicken karahi -- full order was huge . Easily a whole chicken in it . loved the sauce . Great eggplant dish too . Kids loved the tikka massala . Cheap and tasty . Would come back anytime I 'm in the area .<->1
The lobster rolls were buttery , flavorful and there was no skimping on the lobster . The bread is incredible . The lobster bisque was also incredible .<->1
Kids loved seeing all the animals super fun for kids . Friendly service took a while for food to show up . I would go back .<->1
Loved my acorn squash stuffed with mushroom risotto entree . Wonderful mix of flavors and very filling dish . Service was great and ambiance was date worthy . Would definitely come back next trip to Cleveland .<->1
Amazing pizza . Great crust . Best crust taste I 've had . The wings are small though . Service was good . Atmosphere is really great .<->1
Disappointing . The " Maine " lobster bisque , is n't from Maine ( I doubted it would be ) . The " seafood Thursday " advertised on the website was canceled 6 months ago , now they have hamburger night ... so disappointed . 0 for 3 at this hotel .<->0
Went twice ... burritos and enchiladas . Both were mediocre at best . The staff is friendly and nice , just wish the food was better .<->0
The food did n't have any taste . We had the Tofu , ginger and basil and the Plaisir de Bouddha , both tasted like water . Service was just ok . I would n't recommend this place even for vegetarian / vegan .<->0
Amazing nihari , lamb chopsNaan is good , samosas are very tasty Chicken kabobs are nice too Ca n't go wrong with anything hereIt 's a little pricey and the service is a little slow , but it 's totally worth it<->1
My daughter was ( slightly intoxicated ) and SO excited for this cupcake ATM . It was so cute to make her smile and this giddy for $ 3 ( or whatever it cost ) .<->1
A vegetarian nightmare and a Carnivores dream . Large selection of Fresh cold cut , smoked meats and cheeses . The prices are lower then franchise supermarkets .<->1
This place never disappoints ! Been coming here since I was a kid and they 're awesome . Way better choice than senor taco .<->1
I have been going there for years . I always have the same things - Panzerotti , Pizza and their Abruzzo Salad . Why fix what is n't broken . Great Food !<->1
Parfait petit salon de thé à Verdun . Endroit relaxant ( sauf lorsque la porte du commerce voisin se ferme avec éclat ) et grand choix de thés .<->1
The food is not cheap and is not very good . The place is n't very clean . It 's been open for a long time . If you want to pay for nostalgia rather than quality , this is great .<->0
I had the Chickumm sandwich with Chicken Vegetable Soup . The wifey had the Buff Chix . We both enjoyed it very much . Fresh , healthy choices . Fun drink selection . Definitely worth going back .<->1
It 's perfect ! Golden dust is just the right amount of sweet without being overwheming ! The snow is perfect and it 's so beautifully arranged ! I jumped w joy when we walked past this , so glad they 're here !<->1
Great place to have Chinese food in SW Las Vegas . If you live in SW and do nt want to drive to Spring Mtn . This is the place to go .<->1
The food and service is OK , but the free Wi - Fi is a great bonus for those late night study / eat cravings .<->2
Best thing I 've had here is the shrimp molcajete ... amazing ! Other dishes are good but this is the only reason we return .<->1
Amazing burger .. had the Hell 's Kitchen burger with truffle fries .. best fries I have ever had , meat was very juicy and tender .. recommend to everyone<->1
I 've only had the Philly cheesesteaks and I honestly loved it . I just tryed four fathers and it was better but this is still good !<->2
Great food and service . We come out here once or twice a year and this is always a go - to . Best Bolognese I 've ever had .<->1
Worst McDonald 's I have ever been to ! Dirty and order was messed up the fries were cold and limp . Horrible experience .<->0
A little pricey but its in Boca Park , so expected . Best brick oven pizza ever and for the quality DAMN the price !<->1
This place has always been a big obsession of mine ! The cupcakes are huge and delicious ! They sparkle from the inside to the outside ( literally some of the frostings contain edible sparkles ) ! A must try !<->1
Good food , but no rancho de tia rosa . Miss the old place in Gilbert , wish I was still around . The new place more room but okay for fast lunch .<->2
Every time I call , they are rude ! Every time I go in , they are rude ! Just rude customer service<->0
The services is awesome , The food is great , takes a bit to be made but I look at it as its fresh ! ! No Complaints here ...<->1
Best Sushi in town . The quality is top notch , the " experience " is even better .<->1
A lot of flavors and very nice employees ! ! I think I tried like 10 flavors .. went with the butter pecan ! ! Delicious<->1
A very nice 1st visit . I like the set up . Well lit , good food , friendly people . Look forward to going back .<->2
Best bloody Mary 's in town and great service in the bar . I believe her name was Raquel .<->1
We frequently order pizza from this location . about a year ago the experience was n't so pleasant . However , in the past year it 's definitely turned around ! Very pleasant staff and our to go order is always correct and ready on time .<->1
Good food . Good prices . Good specialty bar drinks . One of the better ' chain ' steak joints , for the price .<->1
Love this place ! Its small , food is so so yummy . Make a rwservation or go early . Very clean and service great . My favorite is the beef sukiyaki .<->1
Rude , inconsiderate owners who have no business dealing with the public .<->0
Exceptional . Love the food , service , ambiance . Roy 's is hard to beat . Never a bad experience . Try the butterfish , you wo n't be sorry . And you can never go wrong with the chocolate soufle .<->1
One of my favorite places in Vegas , reminds me of back home in SoCal I got the matcha custard with nutella inside the waffle cone !<->1
This is a simple review : best place for breakfast period ! But you have to ask for Amber ... truly the best server here ... you have to have the best service with the best food ... just makes sense<->1
Whenever I 'm on mill ave i m going to always make sure I come to this spot . They got some real good drinks .<->1
Roast beef on an onion bun with a side of fries . Roast beef not as juicy as Katz 's . Fries better than McDonald 's .<->2
Looks like a really nice place but there food was n't the best . Oysters on the half shell were warm , steak was dry .. nice place but could use better food .<->2
Great pizza mainly because the crust is so good . Get clam and onion , trust me , this is n't a joke , you 'll love it .<->1
Tried the red chili dip , deep fried catfish ( our fav ) , crispy rice , crispy duck panang ( THANK YOU , yelpers ! ! ! ) , and some sort of street noodles . Still our favorite restaurant !<->1
Nice light sushi . Not overwhelmed with rice . Amazing service . Definitely will return .<->1
Outstanding adobo tacos ; breakfast quesadilla with chicken sausage was also great ! May come back tomorrow ...<->1
Exceptionally good donut that originated from san diego . My triple chocolate donut is so good for a bucks plus staff n store are cool .<->1
Wait time is CRAZY ! But if you have the time you 'll love it ! ! They have awesome drinks and amazing customer service .<->1
I love this place ! So cute & we went with about 11 people we each got the flights one did the entire right side & the other did the entire left side & we left so happy !<->1
The service was excellent and the place seems to be busy every time I visit . Have always gotten breakfast , and the food has been wonderful every time . I recommend Sam 's Cafe !<->1
Overall all great food ... Low cost but good . Parking is a little hard due to construction but overall great !<->1
The silk almond milk chocolate is divine and healthy ! You ca n't have enough of these fro - yo places around ! Love it !<->1
The second ( & 3rd ) time we came here we got the pastor tacos ( him ) and veggie quesadilla ( her ) . It will be extremely difficult for either of us to EVER order anything but these respective two dishes . Done .<->1
Plenty of variety . Quality of the food is above average and the price is excellent . Beware of the bathrooms . If they 're that nasty , how clean is the kitchen ?<->0
halibut pesto was excellent on ragout of vegetables . wine list is a chalenge yet we had a very good wine eventually<->1
Service was great considering they were busy . Really fast seating and our server was a great conversationalist . Had to leave early but will definitely be back .<->1
Good italian food . Definitely not fast food quality or prices . Just a little bit higher but well worth it . Try the " 3 choices " with gnocci , eggplant parm and chicken<->1
I have never been disappointed ! The food is always consistently good . The brunch is amazing<->1
Delicious desert crepes . If you 're staying in Paris hotel , this is a no brainer . Very berry crepe is probably the best of all . The two issues are big lines and hard to find a place to sit and eat .<->1
it is very good food but very very expensive . about $ 275 for a 5 course meal with wine pairings for 2 people .<->1
This is a legendary place in the local neighborhood , McDonalds is across the street and this place blows it out the water . Fries come on plates , burgers are always on point . Fish and chips or salads are excellent too .<->1
Had lunch here for the first time today . Wings were great and fresh from the fryer ( unlike Bdubs ! ) and fries were solid , though my husband thought his were too salty ( mine were Cajun ) . Earned a spot in the lunch rotation .<->1
We got into the city late and looked for a fast bite . Typical bar food and cheap beer . I had some 2 dollar drafts and had some nachos . The crowd got a bit rough later on through the night .<->2
I go their every tuesday and order 2 lbs chicken wings with fries and drink . Everything comes under $ 20 . One of my all time favourite is spicy gar par . They are open after midnight for a late night snack .<->1
We had brunch here . The coffee was amazing ! We all had the tractor driver combos . Everything was great , especially the sausage links . The server was very attentive . The flapjack was good but nothing particularly spectacular .<->1
Always crowded but good atmosphere . Drinks are pretty good .. A little pricey but what else is new . It 's Vegas !<->1
I stopped in here today . Josh was the gentleman behind the counter . Brilliant service , extremely personable , the food was excellent ! I could n't have been more pleased and will be stopping jn regularly as I work 20 steps away .<->1
Loved it ... friendly servers , great food , wonderful and imaginative menu . Omelette options include all the usual , plus applewood smoked sausage , scallions , goat cheese , pesto , andouille , and more . I highly recommend their special French toast .<->1
Best fish tacos EVER . Sorry , Rubio 's ! They 're available on door dash in my area , too . Delicious fish tacos right at my doorstep . Their other stuff is good too . I love the machaca burrito .<->1
Great happy hour prices and great food selections on their happy hour menu ! Yum yum ! Our new date night spot !<->1
Went there for winterlicious , nice decor , nice service , food is OK . Do not order the oysters even if they are on sale . They are too small .<->2
I loved their meat , the sides are also good . Overall thia is my current fave korean bbq in town . A bit expensive but for me its kinda worth it .<->1
One of the best waitress / waiter staffs in the area . Very friendly and knowledgeable . Great food . I will suggest my favorite , the Bison Burger and cajun tater tots .<->1
Came here a lot for breakfast and it 's always been a good one . Also tried their burger steak and gravy and it 's really yummy so came back the next day and ordered another one<->1
Depending on the time , claim a seat / table before you get in line . If you wait you may be sitting outside . It 's a popular hangout .<->1
We ordered Tom Yum soup and Orange Chicken . The lady who served us was so friendly and cute . Food came out quick and tasted really good . Especially the Orange Chicken ! Definitely recommend !<->1
Love this family - owned bar & grill . Lots of gluten - free options , including the best GF chicken tenders I 've had . Great wing deal on Mondays .<->1
Just ok . Overpriced , slow service and questionable portions .<->0
Looks like fast food , but the place and food are so much more ! The burrito and tacos were EXCELLENT , as was the salsa / chili bar . Prices were great , and the food was extremely fresh and tasty .<->1
My husband and I just went in and met one of the owners , Owen . He was so helpful ... explained and let us taste each of the nut milks and juices . Their flavors are amazing ... definitely coming back .<->1
Love it , been there several times now and will continue to return ! Sticky Toffee Pudding = AWESOME !<->1
Not a huge fan of the tacos here . The popsicles however ; they are amazing ! Try the pina colada and you will not regret it . :)<->2
Turkey panini plus fries or fruit ... excellent choice for a lazy Sunday afternoon brunch meal . $ 7.29<->1
Great flavor , great atmosphere ! Had the chicken bacon sandwich with the slaw side , DELICIOUS ! Glad I tried it . I will definitely go back .<->1
Still love coming here for lunch ! Fresh food , calm atmosphere , and friendly staff . Plus , I 'm never too weighed down when I head back to the office ( as in , not falling asleep at my computer ) . Big fan of Rachel 's chicken salad ! !<->1
This place is fantastic ! The boba is perfect , drinks spectacular and food is fantastic . This is a must see and try before you die kinda place !<->1
Worst Taco Bell . Waited in the drive thru line for 20 min for them to forget 2 out of 5 items . Never going back .<->0
Great experience . Surprisingly relaxing music in an Israeli restaurant . Service = 5 starsTime for food to come = 5 minutes Cleanliness = 5 stars , gloves , clean tables Price = very reasonable Food = tasty<->1
The $ 4 house margarita during happy hour is the strongest , freshest , most flavorful happy hour margarita I have ever had . Food is fresh and flavorful and even when very busy comes out quickly .<->1
Absolutely delicious . I ordered the chicken tikka masala . Fantastic is the only word . The history of cornish pastys is also quite interesting . worth a visit for sure .<->1
We have excellent food every time . There is a reason it is reserved months in advance . Very small place , if you are a " foodie " this will become one of your favorites .<->1
I 'm drunk , I come here and order a hot and spicy ( sub The mannaise with Mac sauce ) and 2 breakfast burritos . Tell me why I did n't get any hot and spicy ? ? ? What the fudge ? ? ?<->0
Recently had lunch here and Jose did an amazing job ! He was very attentive and made the best pizza I 've ever had here . I recommend coming here to anyone .<->1
Food is always consistent . Lobster spring rolls are a delicious appetizer . Favorite sushi roll is the Viva las Vegas . Pomegranate green tea is yummy . Not too pricey . Nice atmosphere and decor .<->1
This is definitely the place to go for excellent fresh meat and fish . I swear their Salmon is the very best in the area . You ca n't beat them . The staff is just as amazing . Always friendly welcoming and super helpful .<->1
I think you need to stick to pizza at this place . My pasta was beyond bland . Weak service . My friends enjoyed their pizzas though .<->0
Not the best in the valley , but definitely the best in Avondale . They have a large menu selection , excellent chicken tacos , and very good customer service . I always make it a point to recommend others .<->2
Had the pizza there tonight and quite a few stout beers got to say that was one hell of a great pizza .<->1
The food is just ok , but for the price it 's decent . Saturday 's champagne brunch is a good price , but the waitresses skimp on refills but If you tip the waitress nicely they will keep the mimosas coming<->2
They are a really cool bunch of people all the food has been good and they even delivered to my house at 3 and I was just outside the radius . Thank you .<->1
eh this place was nt to good but not terrible ... basically another run of the mill thai / chinese restaurant but a weird twist ... they had mexican hot sauce ... yea it was weird ...<->2
Terrible service and less than spectacular food / coffee . Chocolate chip cookies are the only thing they have going for them .<->0
It was ok . My burger was n't the best but this place has potential . The sauces are cool but I got boozled with some weird flavors . Thousand Island was good , French Onion & Siracha Ketchup tasted funky .<->2
The management totally ignored our reservation and basically told us we were not as important as walk ins . We had a party of 12 and we confirmed our reservation . Totally ridiculous . Will not be back .<->0
Superb decor and service . Ample vegan menu that is crazy - delicious . Highly recommended !<->1
The desert bar has a great selection of different things to choose from . I really enjoyed the red velvet cupcakes . The cupcakes are kinda pricey , two for nine bucks but the selling point is you can mix and match<->1
Try the homemade jams , marmalades , cookies , what an amazing treat and great gift for any housewarming parties . The Dulce spread and the apricot cookies are to die for .<->1
The best pizza ever ! Ask for extra sauce bottom . Their crust is light and fluffy but crispy . Please trust me and try it . You wo n't be disappointed .<->1
Really good sushi ... For some reason the korean / Japanese mix works here ... They are actually pretty good at both ... I had their sushi deluxe combo and was n't disappointed ... Had their bulgogi and spicy beef soup ... Not bad at all ...<->1
Best pancake I ever had . Had the corned beef hash and eggs . Everything was on point from the sourdough toast to the potatoes delicious ,<->1
Love this place ! Great pizza & staff and I never leave disappointed ( or hungry ) . Keep up the good work .<->1
I tried many others , and this # 1 Hawaiian Barbecue is just what their name say . Excellent food and beverage , friendly service .<->1
Great hidden coffee place especially with vegetarian options . The latte with almond milk is delicious and the vegan blueberry muffin is a must try . The staff was very helpful and patient even with all my questions . ...<->1
Great atmosphere amazing delicious food . Just a wonderful all - around Mexican restaurant ! ! !<->1
Here on vacation and the waitress seemed annoyed we wanted food . Who know we wanted food at a restaurant .<->0
Never had a bad meal here . Always greeted warmly by Raul or his staff . I prefer to eat ethnic food where the ethnics eat , from Italian to Greek to Mexican . This is THE Mexican Restaurant for me .<->1
We love this place . We drive all the way up from Goodyear for the pizza .<->1
Service ok but u usual for the wynn normally highly impressed with service so probably a busy day but good was better than average and served got<->1
Had a great dinner there a couple of weeks ago . My filet was fantastic , great service and lived the deserts . A little hard to find but do n't give up you wo n't be disappointed . Go to Serve .<->1
Went for . Real fast . It was cheaper than most spots but it was not very good . The service was really good and the only reason this place got any stars .<->0
So .. so pizza . The waiter was awesome .. Scott .. but I 've had better pizza . Need to try something else on their menu . ..<->0
This place is essentially the panda express of Mediterranean food . Lacking flavor , spices , etc . The price is a bit high , I paid almost $ 15 for a lamb combo plate and a drink . Is rather go to chipotle<->0
Best Breakfast Burritos ! They give you three eggs and lots of their tasty sausage and cheese .<->1
Everything was cold and veggies were also not that fresh . Pita breads were also not properly cooked<->0
Food was fantastic ! ! ! Would have given 5 stars but service was a bit slow ... Otherwise perfect !<->1
I 'll def be back . I really liked there coffee normally I do nt like breakfast joint coffee . I liked the breakfast nachos and my son enjoyed his kids meal large portion for only $ 5<->1
Very bland food . No flavors . Our table of 10 - the salt shaker was a popular item . Service was a bit slow on a not too busy night . The restaurant is nice and at excellent location . Great ambience .<->0
Great establishment ! I 've been going to this parlor for years ! Year after year they always take great care of me ! The pizza , the beer , the entertainment , you just ca n't beat it !<->1
We Love it here food is always good ! Fried Pickles and fried onion a must try ... I always order baby back ribs , never disappoints<->1
Great decor , fun staff food is good i love being able to see an open kitchen to see what is going on , if your ever at the jack check them out . Small menu selection but good choices .<->1
Fun place to hang out for your sugar rush . Quick service , close to my house . Great bookies !<->1
Crab cake sandwich today was great . Always pleased with the diner and the owners really care .<->1
What a cute place ! The woman in the store was very friendly and offered to let me try samples ! They have some odd flavors like cucumber and cantaloupe , which were both very refreshing ! I ca n't wait to bring my sister here .<->1
I love this restaurant ! ! ! It 's so yummy and it 's different type of Italian . It 's one of my husbands and my favorite date spots ! Definitely recommend !<->1
amazing view city lights menu is always different wich is plus for me i rather have something different every time its definitely and experience to remember staff is wonderful made sure everything was perfect<->1
It 's kinda hard to find the place . But it 's very delicious ! ! The peach cake is especially good !<->1
Authentic Thai food . Menu offers great varieties . Some of the dishes are really authentic and you ca n't find it in any other Thai restaurant in Toronto .<->1
Some of the best wings I have ever had ! Great atmosphere , friendly servers , good prices . We have been here twice in two days . We will return next time we 're in town !<->1
Best casual pizza place in Tempe . I grew up in New York and this is the closest thing to New York pizza I 've had in the Phoenix area .<->1
My friend and I ate here last week and both got severe food poisoning that lasted for three days . The food tasted great but I wo n't be eating here again .<->0
DON'T EAT HERE . My regular size gelato with 2 flavors cost $ 14 DOLLARS . Are you kidding me ? DON'T EAT HERE .<->0
Great crispy wings ! Good prices and cold beer . Numerous wing sauces as well . Skip the place next to it and go here for wings .<->1
Best restaurant to eat salvadorian food , Sopa de Patas and Pupusas are outta this world . Come visit and meet Lupita the waitress , she 's awesome . 1/11 / 17 @11am<->1
Best place for a steak or Philly cheese steak sandwich . Best food for comfortable price .<->1
I come here all the time pizza amazing and chicken fingers are top knotch I recommend this place to any locals that are looking for great place to eat<->1
Delicious coffee and snacks . Vegan options available .<->1
Good service and helpful recommendations . A little pricey , but they do have some unique options ! There are several items made with prickly pear , and you 've GOT to try the side of cheddar jalapeno potato pie ! !<->1
This pleace . Oh man , so good they use mesquite when cooking the steak . Ca nt be beaten . These are the best tacos this side of the border .<->1
Finally tried the much hyped bbt . Had to line up to the door - about 15 mins . Ordered the regular black milk tea . Not bad . Still prefer Ten Rens at Metro . Best BBT . :)<->1
I always go to this place during my university study , it 's very close to Ryerson.food is good but little expensive .<->1
Food was n't bad but the workers were rude and disinterested .<->0
This place is awesome . Great service and even better food . Best bread and cinnamon butter out there !<->1
I had to come home and clean both front and rear windshields . As I was also walking around the car . I noticed there was spots that were there when I took it in .<->0
Simple food done well . Good , friendly service . Recommended for a good old fashioned diner breakfast craving .<->1
I really like Pad Thai here . Red curry is also great . They are doing very good job for serving me Thai food . Authentic ! ! !<->1
I really enjoyed the experience ! What a way to boost your senses . I had the vegan menu selection . Obviously I ca n't post a photo ha ha !<->1
Simple awesome food . Ordered red curry vegetarian . The fried banana with ice cream was out of this world . Never had such good dessert !<->1
So they put craisins in their guacamole , that does n't justify the price . If you are going here for a meal for two with drinks , appetizers , and dessert , It 's going to be expensive and not worth it .<->0
Great atmosphere with amazing music to we it . The baristas were very friendly and helpful ! I loved my chai and my espresso . I definitely recommend !<->1
Definitely the best Carolina style burger for the $ in Charlotte . Fries just ok . Have n't tried anything else .<->1
The atmosphere is great and pleasant staff ! Disappointed by luke warm latte and a " too - dense " croissant though :(<->0
Burger was very underwhelming and they were n't very clear about which beers qualified for the Yelp offer . Perhaps my expectations were too high ( given the hype / reputation of the brand ) , but I would n't recommend the lackluster food and average service .<->0
Not exactly impressed . The Caprese salad had welded basil ... pizza was very good . They offer happy hour after 9 PM but close the kitchen at nine ... The server was ok , good forbid you are excited about your job ..<->0
Rose 's ca n't be beat for banh mi ! Flavourful , cheap , clean , fresh . Rose 's is the best in the GTA ! Thank you , Rose 's !<->1
Terrible service , I do n't know if they 're understaffed or they just do n't care . A lot of open tables with long wait<->0
Amazing ! Friendly and super affordable .. ca n't believe after all these years I have never been here till now .<->1
Service was good , great prime rib and the cream corn was exceptional .<->1
The express line got me coffee when I needed it very badly . What more do you need ?<->1
I rate it a three because although the crab Mac n cheese is fantastic , the prices are insane . $ 12 for a martini . Really ? The food is n't worth the prices .<->2
They take forever and I think I heard one the employees say a racial slur . I am black so you can imagine how upset I was .<->0
Garlic cauliflower - wow ! The goat curry was fantastic . Just the right amount of spice . Loved the flavors of naan and the mango ice cream .<->1
Amazing place . They have catered our events and offer the best customer service . Highly recommend this place .<->1
Iberico ham from Spain was exquisite ! Paella was beautiful ! And all the sinful drinks were perfect !<->1
This location was renovated . Much narrower . Less seating space . Perhaps they intend to use this location to move traffic and not have lazy oafs reading their books like before ?<->2
The best Mediterranean food , ever ! Authentic definitely the real thing . But even if you feel like you might be ready for authentic Mediterranean food , their selection is broad enough for children / novice and those who might want to try something adventurous !<->1
The best tacos in the world ... Love this place .. Quick nice and clean food .. Never got any problems after eating her Mexican food .. No need to say to much just go and try ..<->1
Just had the - New Shrimp tacos - even Chillis makes and serves them better . Terrible food . Disappointed , used to be my go to place in Vegas with all daily meals . No more in 2015 ! Detiorated .<->0
Waited and waited . Two people working . Standing at counter like dead meat . Walked out as I walked out sir can help you now . NO THANKS . Wo n't be back DQ across the street<->0
The burgers are always dry and flavorless . The employees are nice here , but the food just is n't worth the price .<->0
Awesome place , fresh food . They focus on the taste of the tongue . A little expensive . U wo n't regret it . They have 25 to 31 different kind of sushi . Do n't compare the American style with kabuto . that 's a traditional place !<->1
I 've enjoyed this bar for years . The staff is friendly and the outdoor sitting area makes a great summer day of drinking . Plus I 've never had a bad meal from there , love those sexy fries .<->1
Great fun . Great food . Best food in cave creek . Ask any local . I bring lots of visitors to Harold 's and they all love the food and experience . Amanda the manager is . Very nice and accommodating . Real sweetheart<->1
Some pretty good tacos . Closest to Cali tacos so far in Phoenix .<->1
My first time at these events , started us off w an excellent Pinto Noir Going to be a wonderful evening<->1
They just can not get scrambled eggs right , I specifically requested eggs scrambled very soft , and I got bricks .<->2
Super dumpy environment . BUT the wings are out of this world . Love Long Wong 's wings :D<->1
Amazing Italian food , the restaurant itself is nice , the service is fast and the food is great . I ordered the Penne Moscovitch and I 10/10 recommend !<->1
Wonderful Tuna salad sandwich , great coleslaw , pleasant staff , fast service in a clean welcoming restaurant !<->1
Had the lasagna and it was really tasty . Also , the bacon and onion flat bread was great too . Service was awesome . Never had an empty glass .<->1
Good food , friendly staff , pleasant ambient . nice place for groups and families . desserts are awesome .<->1
Always dependable - excellent green corn tamales and cheese crisps . They have several locations and I 've found them to be consistent .<->1
This place has a great selection and great roasted chicken ... Also try the churro 's<->1
The frozen fries ( still stuck together ) I do n't care for . Cut your own potatoes and make some real fries ! The steak and cheese was lacking seasoning and flavor ! You can do better / first time in today .<->0
Good Gyro sandwich and the pricing was also reasonable . Paid under $ 25 for myself and two kids . Pretty good for a quick stop .<->2
Yuuuummmm ! ! ! I am soooooo glad I ran into this pizzeria on Yelp ! I decided to check it out and am glad i did ! ! Their pizza slices are HUGE and delicious . They have great lunch specials<->1
Elmers is great mexican made old style . it 's a little place and not very pretty but the food is the so so so good and the beans are the best I have ever had . go to elmers .<->1
If I could give this place a negative star or none at all I would . First off the food is mediocre at best , and they put less effort into their customer service than I did writing this review .<->0
This was a great place when Marsha worked her . New management is ruining the vibe . Marsha embodied the feel of the era , but now just power hungry management .<->0
Heard about this place and had to visit ... Excellent food , service and laid back atmosphere ... My son and I will be back soon ! It was just what we craved .<->1
This place is so yummy love the dole whip just like Disneyland since I have n't been to Hawaii .<->1
Best Thai food I 've had in a long time . Get the crispy duck ! ! !<->1
Continuously a great place to have a meal in Vegas . Thank you for the continued service and fresh quality food .<->1
The viewThe foodThe ServiceAll greatWhat else do you want in Vegas ! ! Had breakfast ... Eggs Benedict , Salmon bagel well worthHad Lunch : awesome Sandwich Sangria ... freshService was fast always , plenty of aids<->1
Restaurant week . Crowded , waited 10 mins for reserve tableFood was excellent ( Salad , Filet , Salmon , dessert ) Wine prices fair , cocktails were strong . I will definitely return<->1
Decent wings . Had the corned beef boxty and it 's was actually good . Very poor service however<->2
We came in 10 minutes after close and the crew member still served us drinks ! We did n't feel rushed ordering 4 drinks as our server patiently waited and even suggested some popular flavors . Super friendly and helpful staff !<->1
I was at distill tonight and had a great time the bartenders were awesome Corrin mike and Jay provided great service . Love this place .<->1
Talk about the best tasting burritos I 've had so far . ( sorry burrito Boyz but you 're still my # 1 2 am fix :-) ) I definitely plan on coming here again !<->1
Moved here from NY 5 years ago and this is GREAT Chinese Food . Even made me Shrip with Lobster Sauce NY Style with peas and white sauce . Will definately be back for more .<->1
Had a great meal in flag had to try it 's sister restaurant closer to where I live and was not let down at all great food and Service<->1
Hidden Gem ! I have been here twice , and while the service is not always the best the food was wonderful ! The prices were good and the portions generous . I would go definitely go back .<->1
Hands down the best spot in town . Our go to spot for dinner out in the neighborhood . Recommend any of their fresh fish dishes and veal parm is not to be missed ! ! !<->1
Have ate here numerous times , expensive but very juicy burgers . They dump a whole bunch of extra fries in each order too . Sometimes be prepared for a long lineup .<->1
A welcome addition to the neighborhood ! The options for premium coffee in the area were limited to the usual over roasted selections . I will be a frequent visitor .<->1
This place was really awesome , they had amazing food and extremely amazing margaritas . Are waiter was really nice and helpful also and the atmosphere was great ! ! =) )<->1
Hostess in the front was adorable but that 's about it . Ramen was probably the weakest attempt at cuisine . Waited 50 minutes to eat . I 've never been to a restaurant where they do n't have any type of hot sauce ! ! Pitiful .<->0
Patio for Sunday brunch , if you do n't mind ignoring the traffic , very reasonable prices , the food was fine ( it 's not Joel Robuchon so do n't get yer hopes up ) , the service was fine , the setting was outstanding .<->1
Osco busco is awesome . Also had the veal stuff in red pepper as an appetizer . Compliments of the house . Amazing flavor . Thanks for a good dinner .<->1
I do n't get this place . Servers and management do n't speak English so if they make a mistake or screw up your food they still let you pay for it . Very average sushi with lots of creams to cover the flavor .<->0
A definite must ! The food was great and prices were too . Called ahead for a group and they treated us like VIPs . As a Mac & cheese expert , make sure to have theirs , DELICIOUS . Wonderful .<->1
Their teenage cashiers require more training when dealing with customers . Rude and disrespectful to regular customers . I used spend in the range of 2 - 3 hundred dlls a month here . Not anymore .<->0
Porc Banh Mi , Papas Grumman et Horchata ; Succulent et frais ! Un must à Montréal ...<->1
We LOVE this place ! ! Excellent food at reasonable prices ! ! ! It is clean and the service is outstanding . Worth a drive from anywhere in the valley . Goodbye Churches and hello Rocket Burger & Subs ! ! ! May your stay be a long one ! ! !<->1
Six of us and the most exciting dish was for my vegan friend who ordered the risotto . Everything else was just okay .<->2
Do n't be in a hurry . We 're at 45 minutes waiting on an egg . Not even sure how it tastes !<->0
This is by far one of my favorite places , try the crispy basil chicken with a signature malees drink . yum .<->1
Good drinks . Great food . Great crowd . Amazing bar tenders . Favorites are the montzerella sticks , burgers and foccatia . Lots of tvs . Juke box . Pool tables .<->1
Stopped here for breakfast on the way to the airport . The staff was very kind and attentive , food was very yummy and came quickly .<->1
Omg meatloaf and mash potatoes . They were n't hot , sent back , and the returned plate the plate was hotter than the food . Truly disappointed .<->2
These carne asada burritos are the best and totally worth breaking my diet for . Me gusta !<->1
We shop here at least once a month or more . I will never be able to buy produce from anywhere else the prices can not be beat . Plus lunch for me and the hubs under $ 10 !<->1
This is a super cute themed diner that is a little off the beaten path from the strip . The food was good and the prices very reasonable . I had the Portuguese omelet which was good .<->2
Beau ! Bon ! Pas cher ! Décor convivial . On y accueille bien les enfants ce qui crée une atmosphère enjouée . Menu varié et original autant pour les boissons que la bouffe . Personnel souriant aimable et vraiment engagé à rendre votre expérience agréable .<->1
Ordered delivery from amazon prime . Pad Thai and wonton soup . Here 's the pics . Overall pretty damn fast and yummy .<->1
Breakfast was delicious . The sausage gravy and biscuits were very good . The owner , Nick , made our visit exceptional .<->1
here once again but my 2nd time on this trip . The Turkey Holiday SUB OMGGGGG<->1
Great service , but the food is just meh ... I ordered club sandwich with home fries , surprisingly the fries are cold .<->1
Incredibly tasty food and for the price ? ! I mean come on , what is there to think about ? ? Also , added Bonus - great customer service . Will be returning . Thanks guys !<->1
I love there chocolate covered strawberries .. they are the best . Will be back for birthday cakes<->1
Wow .. Never thought I 'd see a Korean fusion joint that had REALLY tasty food & a friendly staff where NO ONE was Korean . The Kimchi fried rice in the burritos are ingenious .<->1
I went to have lunch today , Sunday , and was told they do n't allow ordering from main menu until 1:00 . I left because this info is not displayed on any menu . Either display it or allow ordering from main menu .<->0
Bloody Mary is n't great and costs $ 15 . Save your money ! ! !<->0
Delicious Thai food and great service . Started with the Fresh Rolls . I had the devil noodles " Thai hot " my Mum had the Panang Beef . Yummy ! !<->1
Delivery has been good in past , but the deals including fries or wedges have for last few orders been underwhelming portions . Left with feeling of buyers remorse .<->0
I do n't like it here , but my bf does . I was n't going to review at all but twice now they 've messed up our to go order . The girl I talked to could care less about it too .<->0
Based on management 's poor , unprofessional , & rude response to my initial yelp review ( which clearly indicated that folks should try the Pho ) , I would not recommend this restaurant ... Please read ...<->0
Terrible ! Cold food . Loud . Bad service . Honestly I do n't expect much from a Boston Pizza but this is just unacceptable . Too bad there is n't much choice in Chestermere . Also , stop letting people smoke right outside the door , staff included .<->0
Waited about 8 minutes for some acknowledgement from the staff . The store was n't very busy and now we understand why . We walked out and added it to our do not eat there list .<->0
Freshly made pretzels and hot dog / pretzels prepared right in front of you . Tastes fresh and hot like it should . Get some and eat while gambling or go to the food court .<->1
This is a cozy , local coffee house that boasts of going from crop to cup ! I got a cold brew with their simple syrup and almond milk . It was simply AMAZING ! ! ! I highly recommend getting the empanadas too !<->1
Snooze is a fantastic breakfast place ! The Benedicts are to die for . I like to go here at least once a month<->1
I had the Lamb Dumplings & they are amazing & there homemade chili oil with soy is also really good . Service is fast & friendly OH YA to OH Dumplings<->1
horrible experience . too expensive and rude waiter / waitress . they must think people are fools to put up with this non - sense .<->0
Just a shitty , bootleg version of Rolling Smoke ... with a 30 % surcharge for being next to a dismal pawn shop and having Rick 's fleshy mug posted on the walls . What a mistake to think it might be more ...<->0
so fun ! perfect night out drinking stop to fill your belly ! Watch out for the fireball shots :-p<->1
I always get super friendly service at Arbys , this location is no exception . Very happy staff that definitely works to please . I wish more places had service like Arbys . My dining experience ( s ) here are always pleasant .<->1
Rude and hateful . That is how I describe the manager and owner of Captain Steve 's on Monroe Rd in Charlotte . NEVER NEVER NEVER again will I eat there .<->0
The gotham grill burger tasted like yummy real meat ... i would order it with their special poutine next time again The cashier was very helpful as well<->1
First visit . I had the soft shell crab eggs Benedict ; it is incredible . Great menu selection and service is excellent . Great tasting coffee .<->1
What 's not to like ? Everything made fresh from scratch with many items grown on the property . Well thought out and well executed . I have n't found any item on the menu that I did n't enjoy .<->1
Great food , great service . FYI a reservation does not get a seat on the patio , only confirmed seat in the dining room . That was disappointing to find out .<->1
Cool atmosphere and design , meh sandwiches . I got a turkey sandwich and yes it was ok , the bread was really good but the flavor was bland .<->2
Great low key restaurant , not too busy . Food are fair , decent price and good quality . Fried soft shell crab are amazing .<->1
I 've always wanted to try the Canadian nanaimo bar and this place has a very good one !<->1
Always great food here . We try to eat only organic and gluten free so True Foods caters to that ! We are from out of town but always stop in here for quality tasty food .<->1
The oysters were incredible ! ! ! Atmosphere amazing ! ! ! And the staff was so friendly ! ! ! I love this place ... Definitely the cities best hidden gem ! ! ! Ca n't wait to come back again ! ! !<->1

Great place . Delicious Asian food ! My favorite is the pad thai . Will be back . My coworkers and I love it !<->1
Excellent pizza and cheese steaks . No need to go to NY for pizza or Tony Lukes in Philly - steaks are awesome .<->1
Have been back to this location several times since original review and have had consistently great experiences . Service and meals have been exceptional . I highly recommend a visit to this great establishment !<->1
Gordon Ramsay delivers on all fronts . From the hosts seating you , to the service , to the food , you are not disappointed . Of course it 's expensive , but you actually get a really great experience for your money . I recommend it totally . 5 stars .<->1
Great burger , only thing that was a downside was the price . 10 bucks for a burger without fries or a drink . 4 dollars for a beer . great taste made up for it .<->1
Poncheros never lets us down . We regularly come to this location and the staff is always so friendly and the food is always guaranteed delicious ! !<->1
Food was fantastic as was the service . Waiter recommendations were spot on . Try the fish tacos and the poblano chicken enchiladas .<->1
Best burger ? More like nope ! Their chili fries tasted awful and they use that cheap cheese liquid<->0
Go to this restaurant asap . It 's a great spot with seriously good food , and could use the support of the neighborhood . You wo n't be disappointed !<->1
? ? ? - - - ? ? ?<->0
Sandwich + Porchetta = estomac heureux . Le Porchetta c'est tout petit mais en 5 minutes vous aurez un succulent sandwich fait maison accompagné d'une sauce champignons , moutarde et oignons . Idéal pour manger sur le pouce .<->1
The pho and service here were exceptional . The place has a nice Vietnamese feel to it . I will dine here again !<->1
We were here for dinner and I have to say I was n't very impressed . The presentation was good but the quality of the food was below average for what we paid . I would n't come back .<->0
All I can say is , thirty minutes for three ice creams . I could 've milked a cow and made the ice cream from scratch faster .<->0
Hash House is a unique place with food mainly unlike other restaurants . Huge portions with generous use of quality ingredients keep me coming back ! I love their breakfast skillets and burgers - both loaded with avocado !<->1
The best sandwich place ! I love their sandwich ! Always fresh and customer service are excellent . I do n't have to wait forever for my order !<->1
Smoothie was ok , the staff was friendly and attentive at the counter , but all the tables definitely needed a wipe down as they were all covered in sticky smoothie and crumbs .<->2
Fun outside patio . Super friendly staff . Clam chowder bread bowl is delicious ! Ask for John ... fun and attentive server !<->1
Disappointing . Although the choices were plentiful , the hot food was cold and too greasy .<->0
Yummy in my tummy ! Went here for breakfast and almost licked my plate clean ! Food was delicious and service was great ! Everything on my plate looked picture perfect and the best part was that everything was so tasty !<->1
We got seated right away , cuz the place is huge ! Super service , amazing wine and menu ! We will be back and eat our way thru this great menu !<->1
Great service and excellent food . Try the Galee Gai curry you wo n't be sorry ! We will be back for sure .<->1
The decore and atmosphere is great ! The staff are friendly ! The food is very unique ! But unfortunately the wait time is too long ! And the shisha I had was nt all that good !<->2
Bel endroit , bonne variété . Repas chaud , buffet salade , coin casse - croûte , déjeuners , collations , boissons , café et thé . Produits dérivés . Le service est toujours sympa aussi . Pour un repas rapide , c'est l'idéal .<->1
Great fresh meals , juices , and smoothies . To avoid the lunch rush best to go before 11:30 . I prefer the sweet greens fresh juice .<->1
Great atmosphere , ideal place to go if you are looking for a quiet place with a nice decor and a relaxing music . The menu covers salads , paninis , hot and cold drinks .<->1
We dined here few times and if nothing else the food quality is pretty consistent . We tried spicy squid which is my favorite but spicy ginger is beef is the dish you got ta have .<->1
Enjoyed the atmosphere and our server Ben was great . The burger on the other hand come out well done when we ordered medium . Willing to give them another try .<->1
Food and service were both amazing . Loved the jalapeño fry sauce and my husband said that the fudge concrete shake was the best he ever had .<->1
Delicious food and fantastic service ! ! Very clean restaurant . Highly recommended if you are interested in trying authentic Korean food ! !<->1
This places blows ! Very slow service . Do n't know what the food is like waited an hr . Still no food . Manager had attitude when asked where our food was . At least the Coca - Cola was cold . Which they comped . Whoo - hoo ( sarcasm )<->0
Okay place for a late drink social . Right across from Marriott Hotel and within walking distance within Downtown Mesa . This is the first and only sports bar I visited that sells Arizona Lotteries , very unique .<->2
One of the drive thru supervisors here is super nice and great at what he does . Definitely knows how to value a customer . # LJ<->1
Damn , I love this place . Best gyro I 've ever had , anywhere . Everyone that works here is friendly . You 'll leave here stuffed for under $ 10 . What more to say ? If you have n't been , you 're missing out .<->1
Good food , some really good ... Very cool place . Outstanding buttermilk pie for dessert . I 've heard the brunch is great , but have n't been yet , but will soon . Had a great green chili burger the other day .<->1
Very nice staff and the donuts are absolutely amazing . I got the honey glazed and it 's by far the best donut I 've ever had .<->1
I was very disappointed with crepes had no flavor very plain no taste . The only thing I liked was the fruit . I was really excited to go but I will not going back .<->0
Service is awesome . The sushi is just OK . For AYCE , this place is on the high side of the price range . They really skimp on the portion size of the fish in the nigiri .<->0
Food is okay . I like the potatoes over the hashbrowns and the eggs were good . Service was quick but my server did n't keep my drink filled . Overall , okay place .<->2
Now closed - Used to enjoy Mabo Ramen<->1
This place never has any pizza ! They 're always out ! ! If you want pizza go to the food court !<->0
Excellent brunch ... lots of gluten free options and some well presented twists on standard breakfast fare .<->1
I 've had some pretty mixed experiences here ; it 's very hit or miss . Great place to surprise friends with their inventive vegan offerings . Good place to take kiddos as well .<->2
Was here only on Tuesday and Thursday ... other days its costlier ... shrimp is my favorite along with chicken ... loved the ambience the most ... best place to hangout with friends ... great service ... there is waiting time which I do nt like ...<->2
The BEST restaurant in Vegas ! The view is beautiful and the food is amazing ! ! Will definitely be back next time I 'm there . Very pricey but worth it 100 % . Especially the steak tartare omg it was sooo delicious !<->1
I wish I could recommend , but I did n't get a chance to try the food . I drove out there and they were closed . We 're talking 7:30 pm on a Friday .<->2
Pho Kim long took a pho Kim long time to bring us our food . Food was very ok . Nothing to write home to mom about ... Would come here again because of the name ...<->2
Really great food and atmosphere ! The cocktails are right on target ! Fun and comfortable place to hang out with friends . Great service and friendly staff . I will definitely be back !<->1
Fabulous , very delicious Carne Asada burros for Christmas lunch , with avocado salsa . Highly recommend ! This restaurant is wonderful ! Lee and Pat<->1
Tired décor , uninspired food , over - priced . Nice owner , but this is a last - resort restaurant for me .<->0
I come here all the time . Really disappointed with tonight 's visit . It seems like half the portion size as normal on all 3 bowls I ordered .<->0
The Happy Hour is n't quite as happy now . They took a lot of my favorite drafts off of the HH menu .<->1
This place is awful . Terrible service . Terrible manager Avoid this place . Waste of time and money .<->0
Horrible service ! We went in for drinks and were treated badly because we did n't want to order a meal . Management even came and spoke to us because we had cups of water with us that did n't come from that place .<->0
Seriously a great place for a quick bite at a low price . I 'm normally not a big fan of sandwich chains , but Jimmy John 's just does it right for me :) My favorite sandwich is the Italian night club .<->1
Save room for dessert . The creme brulee gelato and almond bars here were in - freaking - credible . A pretty ridiculous selection of foods from around the world .<->1
Wonderful urban winery . Nice blends , and nice varietals . The Bella Rosa and the Super Tuscan were fantastic . Loren was knowledgeable and extremely helpful .<->1
Oh my god their taiyaki is just amazing . I ca n't go to yonge and finch without getting it . Its honestly the best I 've ever had and I wish they had more locations ! !<->1
Thank you so much to Steve and family for catering my daughters wedding . It was great . Food was awesome . Thanks for making it so easy for us . The Pinkerton family .<->1
Had an amazing breakfast here . The fried apple rings , chicken and waffles , and mini donuts with local honey were all outstanding . Hangover burger was also excellent and service was fantastic . Coffee was also exceptional .<->1
Solid Thai menu and great service make this my favorite lunch place in Las Vegas . Their heat index is spot on .<->1
I just want to say this is the best Thai restaurant in the area ! Kate was very pleasant and warming not to mention kind . I would highly recommend this restaurant !<->1
Excellent customer service ! We came for the sunday brunch . Great deal with excellent food ! Our server was very efficient and friendly . Gave us great menu recommendations . We will return .<->1
Average breakfast and limited menu . Pancakes were dry . Waffle was good as was the bacon . Not sure it is worth the long wait<->2
cool , better then average coffee shop across the street from my company 's Toronto office in the fashion district ( I believe it was called ) . my visit ... roast beef sammich with spicy ass horseradish , awesome espresso<->1
Green Wrap was incredible -- so fresh tasting and the avocado and vegetable fillings were so flavourful ... with it being all raw you think it might not be filling , but I was more than filled . HIGHLY RECOMMEND<->1
Favorite place to go when you need a change of scenery . The food is different in every corner . From fresh meat at Sebastian 's Meats to fresh bread from Mediterranean Bakery .<->1
Awesome dinning experience . Happy hour menu allowed us to try several dishes and the food was wonderful . Rich in flavor and fresh ! Wait staff very attentive to our needs .<->1
These donuts are OG . Do n't mind going out of my way for a fresh and good tasting donut . A must stop ! !<->1
Wonderfull Sweet Bread and Catfish ! Nice little restaurant inside Bass Pro Shops with good food and cool atmosphere . Great for family or date nights . Prices are fair for what you are getting .<->1
They are disorganized . If you do nt wait right in front of them they will skip you over and make you wait an hour . Food is average . Gold Hawaiian has EXTREMELY better food and customer service .<->0
Seafood and tofu hotpot was very average at best . The broth was blend but worse the seafood was not fresh .<->2
Excellent as always . The service , crab cakes and key lime pie were wonderful as always ! ! !<->1
Un choix incroyable de bières ! En bouteilles ou en pression , il y en a pour tous les goûts . D'ici ou d'ailleurs , le serveur saura vous conseiller . Bonnes bières , bon service , bonne ambiance , quoi d'autre ? ...<->1
This location has really become much better in the past year . Delivery is always super quick , hot food and accurate orders delivered on a consistent basis . Keep it up !<->1
This place is AWESOME . I have eaten a lot of Japanese food and have seen every trick in the book on the grill . Our chief blow me away with all his tricks . Food was great .<->1
I love their fish tacos ! ! The customer service is amazing , the owner seems to really care about your preferences and how your experience was . It 's a small but homey restaurant . Would come here everyday if I could !<->1
Definitely try the pizza muffins ! The interior reminds me more of a family restaurant , say like a Denny 's , rather than an Italian restaurant .<->1
Walnut Grill has great daily happy hour and drink specials . This location has an awesome patio too . I 've never had a bad meal , but have had slow service when we went once on a busy Friday night .<->1
Spicy tonkatsu , add egg , extra pork and nori is my usual order . Love the pork belly bowl and kimchi fried rice here , as well . Place is small and there is always a wait . Well worth it though .<->1
Excellent home cooking , huge portions and great prices . Wish they had fried okra . We do lunch here a lot . Staff is very friendly & make you feel at home .<->1
One of the best places i ve eaten at ! Me and my wife go here so often and always have great service . I recommend here to eat for all of my friends and family !<->1
Best Mexican in Madison ! Awesome toastados and salsa / hot sauce . Really happy they changed this place to Mexican food<->1
Slow slow service . 19 minutes since we ordered and we 're still waiting on food yet . People were seated after us have their food<->0
portobello mushroom sandwich ! Yummmmmmm . Service can be a bit on the slow side but the food is always worth the wait . Fill the down time with drinks and conversation : 0 )<->1
Great service , very good food , nice layout ... I am a repeat diner who loves this local restaurant . The staff genuinely appreciates you being there ... wow ... no sales / food pitches , good recommendations .<->1
Been there twice and I 've only had the pho with chicken and its freaking delicious , great portion too and I always get the crispy egg rolls as appetizer . The service has always Ben great and quick .<->1
Pizza is good , but the delivery guy throws trash in driveway while leaving . $ 17 cost of pizza + $ 5 tip .<->0
Very delicious crepes . I do wish the staff smiled a bit more . Food is worth coming back though . Worth 4 stars def<->1
A good variety of food and drinks . Vibrant ambience . Good service .<->1
Very tasty donuts and friendly staff ! We went in and asked for a dozen of there most popular and we 're not let down . Cash only though which was a little inconvenient but worth it .<->1
My favorite spot for lunch in Oldtown . Wednesday is build your own burger . Also , the Mac and cheese is amazing .<->1
Food was fantastic , staff was friendly , they have plenty of TV to watch the game . New favorite spot to grab a beer and burger and watch a game . Highly recommended to give it a try . You wo n't be disappointed .<->1
My Dole Whip float was delicious . The employees were friendly . The dining room was clean . We ' ll be back next time we 're in Boulder City .<->1
awesome place ! Hawaiian turkey burger is a fave !<->1
The soups were spot on , the dumplings were very good . The service was n't worth tipping .<->1
If you want to try some exotic game ( I had kangaroo ) and drink some good brews ( I had a smoky - flavoured churck - key ) then this is your spot !<->1
The food was great and very inexpensive . They advertise happy hour 4 pm - 7 pm but were told there is no happy hour . That was the reason for missing star . I will go back .<->1
The Buffet at Bellagio has better prime rib and desserts ( flan and creme brulee ! ) than the Wicked Spoon in The Cosmopolitan , but the Wicked Spoon is a better value .<->1
Really really solid chinese food in Mississauga . Everything i 've had here is decent or good , nothing was horrible . Give this place a try ! ! and they re so clean / have nice decor compared to other chinese restaurants in Mississauga .<->1
Nice bar close to the airport . I like the outside seating viewing the airport and the strip . The bartenders are great . Good spot !<->1
The staff here is incredible , very kind and Courteous . Tara , Chelsea and Linda are my favorite employees always helpful and fast .<->1
The food is great also employees in costumers all know each other so it was fun , and welcoming . HAPPY new year 2017<->1
It 's Subway ... tastes the same everywhere you go ... at least this place is next to my gym and they get you in and out really quick ! nuff said !<->0
Great when you want good food on the go ! Love their Greek salad pita with chicken . Two meals under $ 20 is a bargain these days so I give it a thumbs up !<->1
Dined here a couple times for a casual lunch and dinner , service was great and tacos were good . If you 're looking for a casual place with good service I would recommend .<->1
Sliders and baby brats were extremely tasty . Marzen is a household beer and It sits right next to its partner in crime blonde bock .<->1
Great rolls . My favorite is the Tiger roll . Good seaweed salad . Most of the girls I worked with frequented this place for lunch !<->1
I used to be a big fan however the meat tends to be on the dry side and food overcooked<->2
Ate here at life is beautiful fest awesome food good price its all fresh and good quality and great portion size<->1
Great service for a large group ! Manager called in extra help for our large group and had fast service !<->1
I love their island BBQ combo ! Brought my family here while they were visiting from the east coast and they loved it too !<->1
Went there for dinner tonight . Ordered a margarita and they were out of limes . Inexcusable<->2
I was hesitant to go because I figured for its location it would be pricey and subpar food . But it was well priced , great view , and the food was delicious ! Totally recommend .<->1
Nice Outlet Mall but not so much fun in the middle of Summer ! I really enjoyed the mister fans ! I 've been here a few times and I 've found some pretty good deals .<->1
Wow . Really good , and different food . I like my kids experiencing foods from other cutures . The waitress was very polite and super friendly ! ! ! If you want something not run of the mill this is your place ! ! !<->1
I am deleting the less than ppsutive review because the owner apologized and was concerned about our experience . For that , I am pleased and deleted the " other " review .<->1
Frequently changing flavors ... Always delicious ! Love the atmosphere ... definitely family friendly .<->1
Ok food ... nothing great ... many better Thai restaurants in Pittsburgh !<->0
Great wieners and sausages . Their fries are almost as good as the great McDonald 's fries with lard . I miss fries fried in animal fat ! Bring it back America .<->1
Good food , service a little slow . Vodka pasta was good and the salmon was tasty . Angry shrimp also tasty , although they should use larger shrimp . Location is perfect next to the stadiums .<->1
cute place , good service and food was delicious ! !<->1
Ever since a co - worker turned me onto this restaurant , I have not been disappointed . The spring rolls and peanut sauce are addicting . They also have the best hot and sour soup , I 've ever had anywhere ! !<->1
Solid little breakfast joint . Not fancy , but the portions are large . Seating is limited .<->1
Its a tradition to hit the In and OUT in Vegas before going home . Whether you lost $ $ $ , lost your mind , or just got lost . These burgers make everything happy again . Thank You In and Out .<->1
This family american style breakfast restaurant . Hubby ordered country style and i ordered tuna sandwich . Quite good and huge portion . My portion is include soup of the day .<->1
Fantastic chicken kabobs -- incredibly tender and tasty . This is clearly a shop that takes pride in great food .<->1
Went there for dinner and a movie . Pizza was great and the theater is clean and comfortable with the reclining leather chairs .<->1
If it was n't for the excellent service this would be a 1 * review . The food was FLAVORLESS . I mean white bread FLAVORLESS . The beer selection was so - so for an Ameri - pub and the speakers were deafening . Wo n't go back .<->0
My boyfriend and I eat here often . I absolutely love the lemon pepper wings , not a huge wing eater , and their fries are amazing . I highly recommend this place if you are looking for some good , fresh BBQ .<->1
Wow ' O ' wow ... yummy pastries . I love this Bakery . I usually go to the one on Tropicana but was close to the Eastern location .. Same great quality ! Love the chocolate kiss thumb print cookies ! Hehe thumbs up for Freeds ! !<->1
So unimpressed . I just threw out $ 30 worth of horrible , horrible sushi . It was foul tasting , smelling and looking . The tuna nigiri had bloody veins running through it . Super confused how this establishment has 4 star average .<->0
I will definitely be returning to Luciano 's ! I loved the ambiance , antipasti board and the service .<->1
This was pretty good . Everything was good . Not great . Not bad . Definitely not horrible . Just good . If you need a place that you can sit down for a quick decent bite , not a bad place . Just my two cents .<->2
Do not get the house margarita ! ! Tastes like cheap tequila on ice .<->0
Loved the adult cheese sandwich . Great family and adult atmosphere . Large selection of craft beers . Reasonably priced .<->1
Always super quick in the drive through . I always get the toasted coconut cold brew . Usually there is 10 cars ahead of me but they go really fast<->1
The " kegged " cold brew coffee is delicious ! Especially if you like the flavor / texture of a good coffee stout .<->1
i love this place really good , really clean , not to expensive , and food taste great . come here all the time .<->1
This place is amazing . Prices are good , selection is amazing . I walked up and down the rows many times and there was so much to see . I was looking for Talavera and I found it .<->1
Was in Vegas visiting my sister . She took me here . Pleasantly surprised . I liked it . Service was great .<->1
The service is great ! Hardly any wait . The egg Foo yong is delicious and the house won ton soup is my favorite . We have been eating at King Wok at least twice a month . We love it !<->1
The food was excellent : super fresh and amazing presentation . The service was fast and courteous . The price was right for the food and service . I 'm definitely coming back .<->1
Pizza was a little spicy this time . The waiter was very good .. Will return on our next trip to Arizona .<->1
Order a side of the hot - sweet & sour sauce with anything you order . It is the BEST !<->1
Great service , fresh , good draught beer selection , the cowboy is way hotter than they say . Sweet potato fries are awesome and an all around great experience<->1
the best mexican food in las vegas . wow<->1
Could n't find a clean table out of 7 open tables . Pizza was n't bad but we wo n't be returning . Soda fountain was very sticky from old spilled soda .<->0
Best Gyros in Arizona . Dolmates are the Bomb . Great service always friendly . Cold beer and warm smiles .<->1
I think this place is being exagerated . The service is fast but unfriendly . The breeads were not fresh . Waste of money :(<->0
Have been here a couple of times . It is a great spot for relaxing after shopping in Downtown Summerlin . The service is always great and they have a variety of food , including sushi !<->1
South Beach Bake is the best of Italy without the pasta ! Great service . Chicken JoJo is a winner as well . Watch for them in their new location April 2018 - 627 W Bagley Rd in Berea<->1
What a great store to have so close to my house ! I love supporting small businesses - the couple that owns this was so helpful when I was going in multiple times to plan my daughters birthday ! They even inflate balloons !<->1
Worst service i ve ever had at a " fast food " place . Staff is slow , careless , ghetto . I m confident that this was not just a bad day ... everyday at this brueggers is the same disgraceful service . AVOID .<->0
We had the hamburger , hummus which they forgot to bring out . Tacos and sauce was really bad and cold , quesadillas and something else all cold but the Riesling wine was very good and the negroni was very good .<->0
It 's far from the strip but , the drive was worth it ! We got the Taro macaroons with lychee ice cream and iy was very good . Liked that the macaroons were chewy .<->1
Very yummy ! Victoria is super nice . I also like how they are open late I will come back :)<->1
The Don pizza was a bit overcooked , but the flavors were good . The spinach salad was perfect and the caprese was fresh and delicious . The service was excellent and the manager was super friendly .<->1
The vegan food here was gross . Bland , no flavor . The service was good . The beer was good . Good atmosphere<->0
This is not food it is complete junk . If you want to die soon eat this stuff otherwise avoid at all costs .<->0
Great food , awesome service ( thank you Chase ) and very reasonable pricing . Next time I 'm in the area I will definitely be stopping by again !<->1
Adorable place . Have n't tried the coffee yet but stop here for lunch for pizza & pastries . You can also get ice cream , and there are a few shelves of pantry goods you can buy on your way out .<->1
First time here - ordered the poke and fish tacos . Everything was fresh and fabulous . The tacos were enormous and the mango salsa was delicious . Would definitely come back .<->1
This place has nice service . The menu is limited . I did n't like their appetizer . Food is so so . Their price is good for the food . I would need to come back here to try their soondubu .<->2
My favourite stop on the way back to Mesquite . Good to excellent service , with a small , and no mistakes on my order .<->1
Probably the best gelato I 've had ! ! Tried the marscapone , lemon meringue , sticky toffee pudding - all were great . Unique flavors , great texture , and not too sweet . Plus the guy serving you is legit !<->1
Great food ! I had a lamb burger which was delicious . The vegie side was a mix of red peepers , squash , broccoli and onions sauteed in oil . Really great ! We definitely will go back .<->1
Had a great first experience at this place . I had been to the cedars on edmonton trail multiple times and this one is just as awesome . Reasonably priced , hot , fresh and delicious . 5 stars .<->1
Drove around Vegas looking for a pizza place and just happened to pull in here . EVEN IF THIS IS OIT OF YOUR WAY , GO ! ! ! The best pizza I have ever had ! Lots of regular customers here , definitely a good sign .<->1
Great food , with delicious house made sauces . And . . . A huge selection of great craft beers also draft wine !<->1

Friendly service ( 5 out of 5 ) and free soup is offered while you wait ! ! ! The food is GREAT . Will def go back .<->1
Wow ! My wife and I ate here for the first time today . The meal was awesome . BT has earned a revered place in our list of great dining spots .<->1
First eatery on our Vegas trip . Came at happy hour and it was pretty quiet . Has beat the clock pricing . $ 4 at 4:00 , $ 5 at 5:00 etc . Our server , Paige , was friendly and prompt .<->1
Best hotpot restaurant ever ! Great food at reasonable price ! Really enjoyed the environment and the service ! If you are looking for a nice place to eat tonight , where else to go !<->1

What a great place . Food was excellent as was the service . Nice outdoor location . Will definitely go back again next time I am in town .<->1
Great service . My breakfast was good except my hash browns were mostly cold and barely cooked . The eggs and toast were great and we were seated quickly even tho the restaurant was packed . Very nice waitresses and hostess .<->2
$ 3.05 each or 6 for $ 15.Bought a box of 6 and tried lime & coco , passion fruit and pistachio cream . All 3 were very good ... especially the passion fruit one ! Pistachio and maple bacon are only available on weekends .<->1
Loved the food and the people at Dhaba ! Fabulous and flavorful , true , rich and delicious Indian food , and I know Indian food , it is my favorite . This is one of the best .<->1
They always seem to get my order correct . And most of the time McDonalds never gets it correct . Plus it 's in close proximity to my home . So I like it very much .<->1
Amazing seafood by the pound place , I used to go to hot and juicy ... but this place has them beat . My go to any time I 'm in Vegas !<->1
fresh , rich , filling , juuuuuuicy burgers<->1
Best pho in town after trying golden turtle , tien thanh and all other pho place on Spadina . But only the pho are good , rice and apprentice were just ok .<->1
Fast service , mor a very wide selection of food , this place could have a better coffee quality<->2
One of the best values for your moneyIn Las VegasBeautifully the decored restaurantThe food great for the valueArshay ask for him as your waiter one of the best waiters in all las ' VegasTotally recommend this place<->1
Pas facile de lancer un commerce de gâteaux et biscuits . La réussite de ce commerce prouve qu'il offre des produits exceptionnels attirant une clientèle fidèle .<->1
Mimi 's has a good low calorie menu and solid service . The coffee is excellent . Muffins and coffee are free for waiting customers in the morning .<->1
The Greek cuisine is simply amazing . Fish could n't tats better in La . Cheers & salute ;)<->1
The best most friendly service . Great food . I love sitting at the bar and having a few margaritas .<->1
Great food and great service ! Street tacos were awesome , Fajita to die for and the place looks great with great views . 5 stars !<->1
terrible food , pad thia are tasteless , like a food court ...<->0
Awesome customer service ! The ice cream is handmade and they have a banana cream pie flavor that is amazing .<->1
Came here with my husband and in laws . We thought the food would n't be enough but it definitely filled us up . Everything was delicious .<->1
i am very ! ! very very upset ! ! i called 3 times and got no answer ! ! your mcdonalds ! how busy could you possibly be !<->0
I ordered a Bayou Chicken Salad from GrubHub for lunch . It was delicious and a generous portion . Lots of chicken , nice fresh greens , hard boiled eggs , bacon , and tomato .<->1
This place is amazing . Way cheaper than Korean barbecue and you will have a fantastic experience . The appetizers are fantastic , the soup is fantastic , and all the meat tastes premium and it wo nt run you over 20 dollars .<->1
The service was lavish and deferential . The entrees were wonderful , but the buffet kinda blew my socks off . Everything was new to me , but fresh and delicious .<->1
I just loved the food there ! The no . 9 spicy ramen , kimchi & sweet potato pizza , pork and beef hot pot ... I just have to go there once in a while to treat myself !<->1
Fresh seafood and fish . So many options for topping and a great kids meal ! ! ! Super clean and friendly staff<->1
Consistently had a great experience and great food here . We get takeout and it 's always ready quickly . Our typical order includes Kung Pao chicken and Kung Pao vegetable , both of which have been excellent with fresh vegetables .<->1
Best Mexican restaurant I 've been to and one of the best services we have received at any restaurant .<->1
Great Pho and boba smoothies . Owner was super friendly . Quick service . We ordered the beef Pho . Would recommend .<->1
Small Friendly Family owned and operated . The kind of breakfast place I look for . Wish I did n't live an hour away .<->2
I went there for a company event , and the food quality & services were way below my expectation ! ! ! And I believe that this may still be truth . http://www.thestar.com/news/canada/2016/01/15/reality-didnt-always-match-the-menu-at-toronto-restaurant.html<->0
Great service our waiter and busser were super nice and attentive . Food was delicious and portion sizes are great .<->1
Here for lunch . Great portions and great beer . Wonton nachos rocked ... burger was huge . Service was awesome 5 stars for sure !<->1
Simply put , the best that Vegas has to offer . Excellent food , drinks , entertainment , service by server Jeremy . Do not miss this place when in Vegas . Great bang for the bucks<->1
This was a great place to stumble upon for breakfast with a modern Mexican twist . Busy place , lively atmosphere and friendly wait staff . Will try this for dinner as the dinner menu looks very good .<->1
Great service Was waited on as soon as we sat down Great food Food came out very quick At a very fair price Try this place Thank you Mo !<->1
Very meh . It was fine . We wo n't be back though . Maybe the pizza is great ( we did n't have any ) but the assorted pasta dishes were very average . Pretty disappointing .<->2
Amazing burgers . Usually get the Brie short rib burger . One of the few places in town that grind their own meat so you can get burgers and a medium rare .<->1
Jeremiah and Emily were awesome ! The entire staff is , you can tell everyone working there loves what they do and gives great customer service ! ! I 've always loved Postinos ! ! Happy to welcome them to north Scottsdale at keirland ! !<->1
I like this place i go once a week and they make me feel like family , Manager Zach is awesome very helpful and nice . Burgers are juicy love the bouble mooyah burger .<->2
Pretty good pizza . Thin crust with lots of toppings . I like that the waitress advertised the beer special without me having to ask . I 'll be back .<->2
I have never been disappointed in this place . Friendly staff and reasonable prices , it 's usually crowded enough to be fun , but never too packed .<->1
The best Chinese food in the university area . Get the chicken fried rice .<->1
This is , without a doubt , the slowest Starbucks in the state of Arizona . Possibly the slowest in America . Unless you have an extra 20 - 30 minutes to wait for your drink , I do n't recommend this location .<->0
Delicious every time . The blue flame is the best . We usually come for happy hours and it does n't disappointz<->1
Great tataki salad . great use of fruit and interesting textures in rolls . Amazing quality fish<->1
Very good food and service . Jessica was our server and was super cool . I ordered the " hangover cure " and it was bomb ! !<->1
Second time in less than a month that we 've waited more than 20 minutes in the drive through and the fried rice is n't even cooked all the way . The food and staff here are awful<->0
Amazing ! ! ! I loved the lomo was off the charts and it came with a edible flower to add beutifull touch ! ! A MUST TRY ! ! !<->1
My husband and I tried this restaurant for the first time tonight . We both ordered burgers and shared an order of onion rings both were tasty ! Our service was great too !<->1
Flies everywhere , service was horrible and we started at dirty tables our entire meal . Do n't even give it a shot .<->0
Their specialty is the beef bone soup . It comes plain .. without any seasoning . They have seasalt ans green oniona on the side for you to add . Side dishes was average , except kimchi .<->1
Kind of quick - but not ideal . I definitely feel like chipotle is better in this regard . I got a bowl and despite seeing that the meat was being prepared separately I went home to a cold meal .<->0
We were welcomed even at the last 35 min of their lunch special , and they brought out fresh cooked pizza , friendly staff JJ was helpful , 7.99 AYCE of pizza , salad and drink<->1
This place has what I 'd call good pizza , but the lasagna was just awful so skip that completely .<->2
Awesome food , more authentic than anywhere else . The mushroom enchiladas and carne asada tacos are fantastic . Try the polo fundido as well<->1
Drive thru experience was Ok . People we 're nice . But ... How do you NOT have ketchup available ! ! ? ? You sell breakfast sandwiches and hash browns . Going to eat my sandwich ... NO NAPKINS . Not a one . Seriously WTH ! ! ? ?<->0
This place has a great quality sushi with great service . The only thing on the downside is that it is pretty on the pricey side of the sushi restaurants in Markham .<->2
Not a bad place to check out . Foods good , place is quiet , service is polite , but a bit slow . I m ok with it though , gives you tome to socialize without an interruption .<->1
Smoke a J , go to Rudy 's , get a big juicy tender made to perfection sub ... Enough to make anyone horny<->1
This has become a regular take out place for us . The Chicago style pizza is the best and the hot sandwiches are a great option too . Great neighborhood atmosphere , kid friendly place .<->1
The McDonalds of pizza . Skip it and walk half a block to the Big Slice .<->0
Great place . Good customer service . Not so much people when I came here . However , it 's a hard place to find because it 's behind everything . Food 's good . Mongolian Beef rocks !<->1
Had lunch here today . The salad I had was crisp and fresh . The chicken had a great taste . The portions were very good . The place was clean . The service was fine . For fast food and selection we will be back .<->1
My friends seem to love this place , but I just do n't get it . Tried it twice and I was never impressed .<->0
Hands down one of the best pizza places I have been to here and I am mad I did n't discover it sooner ! Such wonderful and attentive staff . The garlic knots and pepperoni pizza were absolutely delicious ! ! !<->1
Grabbed a cup of coffee but writing the review for the amazing orange cranberry muffins ! She bakes all her muffins on the spot , so good I will be taking some back home to Cincinnati with me .<->1
This is one of my favorite places to eat in Vegas . Not only is the curry awesome , but the owner personally greets every customer as they come and go . Very welcoming , great service and food ! !<->1
Good homemade food . Large portions , enough to share . Liked the cafeteria style with no waiting when you go early .<->1
Small family run restaurant . Great sushi . Always fresh and nicely prepared . Their bento box is great too . Always a family favourite .<->1
Had the cashew beef Spicey and it was outstanding we were a group of 13 so had a number of different dishes and they were all good - clean good atmosphere and excellent service<->1
They have the best egg drop soup I 've ever had . Their broccoli w / oyster sauce is good to .<->1
Best breakfast deal in Las Vegas $ 4,95 ... great customer service breakfast on table in less than 10 min .. delicious coffee too .. Skip Starbucks while in Vegas .. They are a rip off here .<->1
This is good for a subway . The food is good and the employees can be very nice & patient . Not all of the rolls are good @ subway . Find what you like & stick with it .<->2
I 've never had a bad experience here . If anything I have received a free drink when there was a mis - communication in who was going to make my Venti Iced Coffee . :)<->1
Every time I come here I leave feeling satisfied . The only downside - they ran out of the posole before we could get any . This place is the real deal for people seeking excellent Mexican food .<->1
Good solid breakfast , especially if you order before 6 am . Wife had steak and eggs for $ 4.95 . Nice variety of other breakfast items including pancakes waffles and grits . A definite go to at South Point Hotel .<->1
I really liked this place . Can anyone confirm that it actually closed down ?<->1
I traveled through Spain all last winter , so my expectations were high . They were met . Food , wine , and service were spot on . Make sure to order the cauliflower with roasted dates and the veal cheeks .<->1
Loooove Violettes . Food seems to be high quality and delish . I 'm not vegan but many friends are so this place is perfect for them . Great service and cute atmosphere also !<->1
They lost the order so the food came very late after we had to complain . The burger was undercooked despite requesting medium . They were only willing to comp a single beer . I would not recommend .<->0
Great home cooked food very authentic and I highly recommend . The prices are great too .<->1
It was better with old owners . But still pretty good . If you want some wings that taste home cooked this is the place together then . Brings back some childhood memories .<->1
First time customer . Wo n't be a repeat that 's for sure . Way too much to write , but I will say terrible service and incredibly overpriced . Payed $ 37 for 3 sandwiches . What the heck ? ! Easy on the mayo , guys . Sheesh .<->0
I absolutely love the wet burrito - the best I 've had in Charlotte<->1
I have been in 6 - 7 different shawarma restaurant and this one is the best I have ever eaten . So delicious and fulfilling .<->1
These are by far the best hot dogs in all of Phoenix ! The staff is very easy going and very friendly as well ! Memo is awesome ! I would recommend them to anybody !<->1
Donuts were n't worth the price . Waffles were terrible . Staff did n't know how to make the waffles . Ordered a waffle with strawberries and got about 6 pieces of a terrible strawberry on it . Wo n't go back !<->0
I 've been here several times and the food is always good . The service is excellent and they seem to have a pretty solid and stable staff .<->1
We stumbled upon a great authentic Persian place to eat . The food was fantastic and very fresh . We definitely will return<->1
The hotdog was dry and the bun so big yiu could nt taste the meat . Diaappointing food but good concept .<->0
Sticky tables ... Is the reason for my 3 star review . Other then that place is good and speedy service . Everyone 's very nice and drinks are awesome .<->2
Love love love this place . The poke stack yes the salmon yes and thank you The bread pudding hot damn<->1
At 12:45 pm , this place was packed . Some had to stay outside to wait for their seats . Good food , service and reasonable prices for a Thai restaurant . I would come back again next time when I am in town .<->1
Not just your typical plain tasting snowcone with some flavored syrup tossed on it . Great flavor and very generous sizes !<->1
I love this place . The food is really good and the atmosphere is great ! It 's located in City Center across from the Mandarin Oriental hotel .<->1
This place is a bit out of the way but they have The best jumbo shrimp egg foo young with sauce .<->1
Great food . Great service . Great hospitality . Food is always fresh and made - when - order . The staff take pride in the quality of their service and food .<->1
Overcooked CIOPPINO was terrible - returned that . Ordered the mushroom soup - bland bland bland . Disappointed in the food . Drinks and service were good but not sure if I will ever go back for food<->0
Great healthy place to go if you are in a hurry . Service is quick and food is great . Ca n't go wrong with the Lentil soup , any of the salads and the hummus is very good .<->1
This place is always Awesome . Thought that the other place on Ossignton was good , but this place is much much better . Its become my weekly stop for Pho on the way home from downtown ...<->1
I like this frys . Not busy , Isles are clearand clean . Not that busy either . Shelves are well stocked and workers are actually helpful if they see you wandering .<->1
Great casual restaurant with excellent pub food & drinks . The fried chicken special is to die for !<->1
Updating with an extra star because we went back today with a reservation at 6 and were sat immediately . The food was heaven and the korma was maybe even better than last time !<->1
Loved the onion rings ! They were thinly sliced red onions lightly dredged in flour and fried crisp . The Wallburger sauce is tasty too . Good burger with terrific pickles ! !<->1
Definately try this place ! We went with a large group and everything was delicious . They even gave us desserts because we mentioned Yelp .<->1
Beautiful place to rest and drink excellent beverages . They have almond milk . And their restrooms are GENDER NEUTRAL . good job , Cleveland .<->1
All I need to say is , get plain vanilla , almond roca and Andes mints . You will not regret it .<->1
Really good smoked turkey sand which . Sad fries not included for 11 bux . Happy they had many good beers on tap . Friendly staff .<->1
The food was excellent ! Great venue , and clean . Exceptional service , will definitely return !<->1
Truly great Coffee ! ! Love the comfy couches ! ! Very good ambiance , coffee has high quality as well as the staff are really friendly . It feels homey ! A great place to bring down your laptop and stay for a few hours<->1
The service was great . The newly designed steakhouse is gorgeous and the music was cool . The food was good . The lighting was nicely set . Just thought it was slightly over priced . I will return because I m close .<->1
The moco loco is the shit the fries are bomb and all the different ketchups ... the shit<->1
Order the bake pork rib rice.but the pork meat still pink in color . The food going more worse nowaday .<->2
Best chicken fried chicken with gravy , loved chicken pot pie I tried for first time . Save some space for dessert waffle wonders it was wonderful .<->1
The band , the bar , the atmosphere was the most fun we had in old town . Imagine country red neck band playing neil diamond covers . Too much fun ! !<->1
Craig was more than helpful when I was in there , wish I could give him 10 stars ! Thanks for taking the time and helping me out and being so friendly ! I will be back soon ! ! !<->1
This is a wonderful clean store with a fantastic selection of not only meats but a lot of food items . They bake bread fresh daily . The staff is friendly , efficient , and helpful .<->1
The alien burrito was amazing ! I got it vegan style and did n't expect it to be as good . This place sure does beat going to a Starbucks type of coffee shop . Vegan friendly . would deff go back again ! !<->1
Awesome . Food was great , service and atmosphere was great . We loved it . Parking is rough but everything else makes up for it .<->1
Absolutely delicious shawarma ! All sauces and deserts are home made and are scrumptious ! Definitely one of the best shawarma restaurants in Brampton . Very affordable prices , and portions are very generous . Definitely recommend to other shawarma lovers !<->1
Love this place wish we had these in cali energy drink with a shot of watermelon is awesome the 911 is my top drink also the white zombie<->1
Been coming to this store for years and I love the products they have . We come here for vitamins , food , and beauty products . It 's a great one stop shop .<->1
Love this place ! Coffee is great and pastries made fresh and yummy ! There 's outdoor seating great for when the weather is nice .<->1
There are not enough yummy words for how great this place is ... I had the crab puppies as a starter , they were delectable ! For my entree I ordered the pterodactyl burger dressed traditional with a side of the Pimpin ' fries ... YUMMERS !<->1
Great food nice beer and friendly faces :) Ca n't ask for much more , I add the Asada steak which was just great !<->1
This is a great Chipotle location . The staff were all friendly , and I was in and out in literally 3 minutes . Also the sofritas could make a grown meat eater cry from deliciousness .<->1
Gianna was the very best guide to our Wolfgang excursion . She is a doll . Hope you get her ! ! xxoxoxox<->1
At least for today ... broken grill ... waiting 45 for a chicken wrap ( still has n't arrived ) many empty tables ...<->0
The 3 course combo is a great deal ! ! ! Cheap filling and downtown . You even get chocolate chip cookies . Sundae bar is still in a BATHTUB - bring a party - there 's room for it and no one here .. people forget about it .<->1
The food is way overpriced and it 's not very good what I can say positively the service is better than the food . Do n't waste your money<->0
I come here at least every couple of months because it 's close to me and has great subs . It 's usually not very busy which is a plus , and my food usually comes out pretty quickly .<->1
Parking is not convenient , he restaurant has a Really cool atmosphere , but the food was n't very high quality . More than likely , I will not be back .<->0
Service is horrible the girls just throw the plates . They do n't care at all about the food , service or customer ! Do n't bother going to this location ! Get better experience and food at the Dysart location<->0
Microwave bagels ? ? What a joke very overrated bagel place I gave it one star because the coffee was ok they had real milk but frys bagels are better and Thai not saying much<->0
Their chocolate croissants and macaroons are delicious ! ! If you get the cupcakes - the one with bacon was a hit and I loved the strawberry shortcake cupcake !<->1
Went to eat , front door did n't work and said last call at 9 , arrived just before 9 to get yelled at by a short Asian woman<->0
The food was great as always . The oxtail chili cheese fries are a must . The drinks were awesome . Every time we visit Las Vegas we will be coming here .<->1
nice place they pay attention to freshness herei recommend the : MEATBALL SUB ( sooo juicy ) and their Chilli is the bomb ... gon na go back this week during my lunch break<->1
Went for X - mas even and the food made good left over but nothing to write home about . Also they had a whole list of food items they ran out of .<->0
Walked in randomly on a late afternoon looking for sichuan food . Not authentic Sichuan as marketed . Blah food .<->0
Ground beef tacos are amazing , beer is cold ! Our bartender has always been very kind and assertive ! Highly recommend coming out and trying the food and booze !<->1
Long wait ... When I have to wait 40 minutes for a bento box , something is seriously gone wrong . Food is pretty pedestrian , location is a plus .<->0
Amazing lettuce wraps and tiramisu ! Much better than the Mesa location .<->1
I only had the chicken pita and it was good . Not great but better than most of the food on mill . I would recommend it for a casual or quick bite .<->1
Terrible food inside a terrible hotel . Perfect combo , right ? Overpriced as well .<->0
Love this local restaurant . Good selection on menu . Fresh oysters . Wings are great . One of my go to places .<->1
Ca n't wait to come back ! Filet was excellent , atmosphere is perfect and staff was delightful ! ! Thanks Doug for a great meal !<->1
I love the turtle cookies so much that I buy them every time I come across the street .<->1
The short rib roast was heavenly ! Great mojitos , service , and atmosphere as well .<->1
One of my families favorite japanese restaurants . All you can eat lunch or evening buffets , the selection is great , we 've never been disappointed with the quality and taste , overall really great value for money .<->1
Pushy management uneducated regarding food allergies and cross contamination . Overly expensive . Mediocre product .<->0
Service was great - food delicious - view nice - a good way to spend an evening enjoying good company and great Italian .<->1
I was drunk by the time I got here visiting friends over Christmas break but the atmosphere was great and the staff was friendly dealing with my drunk behind ! I will go back once I 'm back in Ohio ..<->1
AMAZING food ! ! ! Always come here for the lobster rolls and they NEVER disappoint ! More so amazing service by Corey M ... He was absolutely fantastic ! Really nice and outgoing guy ! He made the experience here 10x better ! ! Thank you Corey ! ! !<->1
so there we go ... try and eat out instead of pick up ... we thought it was ok ... commercially acceptable ... we do n't like people much ... so maybe I should not say ... then the food could speak for itself ... commercially acceptable ... other places next ...<->0
Tried this the other day , and found it wanting . For the record I had the S'mores cupcake . I thought the chocolate frosting tasted overprocessed and the cake itself was very dense like foam rather than moist like cake . Pass .<->0
Great beer hall on the strip . Happy hour pricing was good they have a large open floor plan with lots of board games . We enjoyed some micro brews and pretzel with beer cheese and a hot dog .<->1
Average food and service . Kind of dirty and some flies going around . Was ignored by two staff members when I walked up to ask a question . Plastic cups , bowls , and chopsticks .<->0
I love island style ! ! The owner is super nice and the food is great every time .<->1
A little pricy for the size of paleta , but very good . Love that she uses fresh ingredients that are in season , so sometimes the favors will change depending on the time of year .<->1
I love their pork and vermicelli , it 's so delicious . I 've tried their beef and chicken but I love the pork the best . Their food has great flavor and its priced well for what you get .<->1
I went here on my lunch break as I work down the street , service was good , everyone was polite . Great tasting coffee and great location ! Will be returning soon .<->1
24 hours . This North York location has an extensive menu . Most everything is reliably tasty . BUT YOU MUST GO BBQ OUTSIDE . Out back . It opens after 5 pm . You . Must . Oh , btw , there 's free parking out back as well .. That is all .<->1
As always saravana bhavan does not fail to deliver . Delicious south indian fare at a reasonable price .<->1
Had a burrito bowl with cooked to order Chorizo per recommendation of order taker . Mango and pineapple salsa was fresh and tasted great . Guacamole was good as well . Not really located on Southdown . Right in front of Metro grocery .<->1
I spent $ 30 for a sloppy made order . Worst Jack I 've ever visited . No napkins . Food looked like it was smashed . Waist of $ $ $ .<->0
All the pastries I got were very very good . The chocolate chip cookies are so chewy and chocolaty ! I also loved my palmier , it had a nice texture and the sugar was perfect on top . Very quick service and ample seating .<->1
First time here it was the best ! I had the horchata Italian ice with vanilla custard it was delicious . Reviews for this place were right on point . We definitely be coming here again !<->1
Great friendly staff . Would defiantly come back the next time I 'm in NC . Good food and the ice tea was delicious .<->1
J'aime aller déjeuner à l'Avenue pour les belles brochettes de fruits . C'est tout le temps bon et le service est rapide . Victime de sa popularité , il y a souvent une file d'attente .<->1
Great service and amazing food . Try the cheese selection , especially the cheese made in Vegas . Simply the best ! ! !<->1
Very nice staff always clean when I go in here . Really good froyo and good flavor selection<->1
Holy mother of all true amazing mexican tacos ! ! ! The Asada was tender and slow cooked !<->1
Fantastic measl for our first night in Montreal . Had appetizer of seared ahi and asparagus , phenomenal !<->1
Delicious and very filling pasta . Dishes were decently priced . Staff were really friendly . If you 're really hungry and craving Italian , I recommend stopping by Nonna 's Oven .<->1
It 's the first time I came to Las Vegas , and this is the right choice . The food is delicious and all the waiters are very nice ! I 'm very satisfied .<->1
Waste of money and overrated ! ! ! Really expensive and food sucks ! Most of the dishes we bought was not good which surprised us coz Goldilocks food " used " to be so good ! ! Better to go to any other filipino restaurant .<->0
This einstein 's is mediocre . The workers are unmotivated and SUPER slow . They nearly forgot our order . Not worth coming at all .<->0
Went in for lunch , very quiet and comfortable . Got the sweet chili chicken wrap with fries and the chicken was very good , large portions of chicken within the wrap . Excellent fries , good service , friendly employees<->1
Sushi was fresh an tasty . One of the restaurants you can use your $ 20 food credit you receive at check - in . Nice atmosphere and staff .<->2
Went back recently , and it was just as good , if not better than I remembered . I was too long in Las Vegas . Price , portions and service are all excellent . I just wish I lived closer .<->1
Love the beer ... but the food is very average to below average . But who 's going there for the food ? ? ! ! Bumble Berry bear is incredible .<->2
A honest & worthwhile trip to guilty pleasure paradise ! So my amazing parents , B & B , brought me here for some guilty pleasure ! Amazing pizza ... a piece is a meal ! Better than Vincent 's !<->1
Great ambiance and friendly service . The savory crepe was incredibly tasty . Would definitely recommend this little place !<->1
Love the Girl Next Door ! My fav drink ! Burger are to die for with carmelized wine onions .<->1
Today my pizza was very good ! Lamar was very nice and made sure my pizza was how I like it ! Thank you so much !<->1
20 minutes at our reserved table without so much as a glance from anyone , much less a glass of water . Left and went to Flemings .<->0
Fanstastic food and Incredible service ! I got the superfood wrap and my boyfriend got the Vegas Heat sandwich . We were both extremely happy . It really felt like our food was made with love ^ . ^ We 're excited for our next visit !<->1
Amazing as always ! My family absolutely loves this place ! We appreciate the consistency of friendliness and incredible food ! Thanks so much !<->1
The food is awesome and the hostess was so pleasant when we went for brunch , ca n't wait to go back ! Atmosphere is also super cool !<->1
Jesses pizza is great ! Always satisfies my pizza cravings and their wings are delicious ! ! ! Will always order pizza and wings from them , they also have great ranch and fries . TWO THUMBS UP<->1
Amazing food , great breakfast specials , delicious cocktails , adorable venue and the most fantastic service from Allissa . Dog friendly patio , comfortable seating very trendy . I love this place !<->1
great home - style cooking . always fresh , hot , & extra - generous portions . prices are great too . taste of home ! ! !<->1
Great beef sandwiches and burritos . There is sometimes a long line , but it is worth the wait .<->1
I do n't understand why people love it so much , I think they 're just like a sandwich you could make in 2 minutes at your house . I guess it 's cheap semi - healthy fastfood , just not for me .<->0
Delicious mussels and sourdough bread ... We also tried the fondue and the Belgian Frites which were also pretty good . Beer flights were awesome and cheap . Cool atmosphere and decent service on a Friday night .<->1
I 'm vegetarian and they have one that is really delicious and FRESH , and , Good deal all of it ! ! !<->1
Do n't let the location fool you . The food , service and embience is fabulous . We are definitely going back - best Italian we 've had in a long time !<->1
Solid Italian food - great taste and generous portions . Grilled calamari was tender and flavorful as was the eggplant sandwich . A nice surprise in Phoenix .<->1
Delicious food , slow service . Dim sum , duck and short ribs that we ordered were very tasty . Yes , this is a pricy restaurant , but not out of line for fine dining in Las Vegas .<->1
Mahi Mahi we try was the only food that 's good there ... The rest is not very great ! Also , it 's not a very clean place too<->0
Good food , good price . But what made the difference for me was Wiley . He was enthusiastic , loving , helpful . Employee of the year I have to say .<->1
Disgusting . The cashier was wiping her nose and had open cuts on her hands while handling my food . Will not ever retur .<->0
Nothing special to say about William 's . Coffee is average at best and the food as well . It 's cute seeing pets walk in and out of this location though<->2
Awesome place to meet friends and family to have a great cup of coffee ... love the Butterfinger coffee , hot or iced . And the sandwich selections are tasty .<->1
Absolutely delicious ! ! ? Las Vegas strip ? , ? ? ?<->1
A great place to go if someone else is paying . Great sea food , excellent decor and if you reserve , a view of lake Monona .<->1
The portions are very generous and the food was pretty good but the place was super noisy and it was difficult to have a conversation .<->2
Awesome vegan food and a great setting . Was my first experience with the " vegan " experience and I found it quite enjoyable . Surprising how they<->1
Amazing place with great food and impeccable service . Order the catfish or the shrimp and grits , Hell , order anything . You wo n't be disappointed !<->1
We have been to the Arcadia North which was a great experience .. going to Kierland this Saturday .. hope this location lives up to my expectations as a 5 star<->1
Love this liquor store ! Best customer service and great selection ! I will drive 20 - 30 min to go here anytime I need something !<->1
The shrimp chimichanga is a one of my favorite Mexican dishes in town . That dish is surely a 5 . Everything else I have seen or tried in this restaurant seems very average . Get the shrimp chimichanga .<->2
We had an outstanding dinner last night . The food , service and ambiance was fantastic . Highly recommend this restaurant ! !<->1
Great diner and the ppl rude tho lmao ... Tbh they need better workers ... But tbh mcdonalds at this location there business been going for a min lmao tf<->1

Really great option for lunch takeout . A fixed price box , choose items from the buffet . The server will even load the box for you and give you fresh Naan . Food quality is good , can get very busy during lunch hours .<->1
Delicious food and attentive and efficient service . I had the smoked trout and scone , and it well - priced and portioned . As I visited on a Wednesday , the atmosphere was calm and comforting .<->1
used a travelzoo deal - $ 23 for 2 people and for that , it was great but not for full price . red wine sangria was awesome<->2
I 've been to this place twice , and those times I really loved it their pizza is really good , it 's thin but delicious<->1
So amazing to have delicious fresh plant based meals prepped for you ! Really makes leading a healthy and balanced vegan lifestyle so easy . These guys are great =)<->1
Punjabi cheese burger was AMAZING ! ! The masala fries that came with the combo was okay , nothing special . Taste like Costco fries with pepper . Next time i will probably just order the burger ^ ^<->1

Best Italian joint in Vegas . They serve the best Italian sandwich in Vegas ... " The Sicilian " . This is coming from an Italian guy from NY , so that 's saying something ; )<->1
Great food . Can be slow service but it allows you to enjoy your food without the constant bother . Make sure to make reservations !<->1
Service was very slow . Had to wait over 10minutes from the time we were seated to when we got a waiter for our drink order .<->0

The food here was great , the service was quick and friendly . But OMG the Garlic Edamame was FABULOUS !<->1

Good food , kind servers ... we always have a good time here ! And the churros are awesome . LOVE the spice of the house salsa ! ! !<->1
Cronuts with maple glaze & bacon bits ! ! ! Need I say more ? All of their donuts are very special & yummy ! !<->1
I love this place . It has incredible food and a wonderful atmosphere . The prices for drinks and food are reasonable and the staff is amazing . I love coming for a steaks but everything is top - notch .<->1
The food tasted great I ca n't lie , but the fact that they tried to serve us burnt dumplings and got my order wrong the second time pissed me off and was quite inconvenient .<->1
I loveee their chicken , extremely flavorful . The beef is tasty too , but a little rubbery and hard to chew .<->1
Whooooooo I have to say that 's the # 1 costumer service and the food was delicious Will keep coming over with family and friendsWe recommend that place to anyone that like good Food and healthy ...<->1
I love this place . The food is usually sublime and the service perfect . Afterwards you can go for a stroll around the grounds of the Royal Palms .<->1
The lounge fries . Oh god , god yes . That 's all you need to order , and that 's all you need to know . Oh , and the beer and the people are also both great .<->1
I 'm 15 minutes away but its worth the drive when i do drink coffee . Workers were inviting and vibe was good . Solid tea selection white lion .<->1
Great atmosphere , the staff is very friendly . The food is also good and the price is totally affordable . I definitely will come back .<->1
Great food and great customer service . One of the best sandwich shops around . I recommend either the Bobbie , the Capastrami ( my favorite ) , or a the cheesesteak .<->1

When there last night and had a great experience . It was busy and the food was fresh , They even brought fresh tandoori chicken and naan bread to the table .<->1
Horrible service ! Waited 50 minutes for a lobster omelet ! No complimentary drink was offered . Finally left the way we came hungry as hell without being served ! ! !<->1
Two stars ( even though I could n't be stranded too far from a bathroom for a couple of days after eating here ) for the lack of decent thai restaurants in Madison .<->0
Needs to be open in the evenings when people have dessert . We really wanted to try this place , but could n't with the limited timeframe on our trip .<->2
Terrific happy hour , amiable staff . New Clam chowder is scrumptious . A great place for an ice cold on beer and some calamari .<->1
I just wanted to confirm they have gross food . Customer service is n't terrrrible . BUT the soggy fries . ! Gyro meet was actually impressive . Soggy gyro tho .<->0
Excellent burgers fries pulled pork place was very busy atmosphere very good we would go back there in a minute<->1
Best pizza you can buy . I order GN every time I get the chance . I have been in love with this place since I moved to Madison a year ago . Service has been excellent every time .<->1
Great Place . Just NEVER have their falafel and hummus and Pita stuff that they sell around salad bar . It is the WORST tasting falafel and hummus I have ever had .<->2
This place is AWESOME ! ! ! Excellent Thai food , service , and atmosphere ! I started coming here recently and it 's now my favorite Thai food place in town . Eat here , you wo n't be disappointed !<->1
This was my first time dining here . I bought three salads to go and served them at a family event . The salads were a hit ! I plan to return for a 2nd experience when the area again .<->1
My friends and I go here weekly ! We do n't like the " club " scene so we come here ! The bartenders are friendly and the male ones are pretty attractive ;) You get your drinks quickly and they are nt too expensive .<->1
Their Taro Boba is Addicting ! The donuts are fresh and soft ! I recommend to anyone !<->1
The intro on the Drew Carey Show shows Carey with a dog in his hand in front of Steve 's . Carey knows a thing or two about food ! It is while they play " Cleveland Rocks "<->1
i enjoy the environment for the most part , it 's close to my house , and i do enjoy their ice cream ! i 'm just not a big beer fan and the good itself was okay<->2
boooooooo ! ! ! we are here for the frank reyes concert and they told us not to dance because this is a concert ! ! wtf ! ! ! never again !<->0

One of my favorite restaurants for quality in food , drink , people , staff , architecture , ambience , etc . love St Francis !<->1
Best AYCE sushi in Toronto . Food is high quality . But too crowded and could be cleaner . But overall ca n't complain bc food quality .<->1
So good . Love this place . So many choices ! 5 star for sure ! The poke bowls are fantastic . Will try there sushi burritos later . Great customer service .<->1
We LOVE having poppy seeds in the area and the food is awesome but ... we are hoping the service kinks get fixed ! The line moves SO slowly every time or we would be there every single day weekend !<->2
Mike was Awesome ! He made us feel at home at this restaurant ! The dim sum and soup was amazing ! We will be back for sure !<->1
Wow ... the absolute worst manger in Las Vegas have been hired by this location , apparently . she s power tripping<->0
The food is Okay but it 's not worth 44.00 dollars a plate . I feel it 's way overpriced for the quality of meats .<->0
Service was great , seafood is their main forte . So if you 're not a seafood person do n't do it . Lobster and sushi is amazing !<->1
Hands down one of the best lamb biryanis in town . Hard to find the real stuff in this city . Only 6.99 . Great service , amazing food , affordable prices . Ca n't go wrong<->1
LOVE this place ! Service = 5 starDecor = 5 starFood = 5 starSuch a hidden gem in the southwest valley . If you enjoy fresh Japanese food done right , do yourself a favor and check this place out . It 's phenomenal .<->1
This place is friendly and offers a great selection of gourmet cheeses . The bread is also to die for . Sesame cheese sticks are rich and have a little kick .<->1
Small place with only 3 tables , mainly for take out . Menu exactly the same as the other location . Recommend all of their rolls ! Good price and big portion .<->1
Cheap , fast and this location looks better and is bigger than the other 2 around . They serve drinks too .<->1
I ordered a salad and cheese sticks . Both were absolutely delicious . Will definitely be eating here again . The prices were reasonable . The food was delivered from Grubhub and it came with the hot food hot and the cold food cold .<->1
Waited forever for service . Was n't disappointed with the food though . The staff just needs to be provided with help during the busy times<->2
Just got put on hold for seven minutes before being hung up on while trying to place an order . We 'll go elsewhere .<->0
Great place . They 've definitely sped up the process . Does n't take 30 minutes anymore .<->1
My favourite sushis . If you feel adventurous try the combo for two :) a lot of specialties from the chef . Great staff . Worth the detour ! !<->1
Service is very slow for only 6 people in the entire restaurant ! It should n't take 30 min for pancakes and eggs .<->0
Love visiting Viet Kitchen ! Food is amazing and everything was perfect tonight . Stir fry and grilled plates are to die for . We will be back for sure ! !<->1
My new favorite place for breakfast . Friendly staff and great food . If you do n't try the deviled eggs your missing out . I ca n't wait to go back .<->1
Really delicious family owned and operated restaurant ! Traditional Mexican flavors and recipes !<->1
Really great environment in the Medina square . Food and service were both good . We will definitely go back !<->1
Nicest waitress . Worst service . Mediocre food . I understand we 're at an amusement park . My husband suggested we go elsewhere to eat but based on reviews assured him it would be fine ... I 'll never hear the end of it .<->0
Big portion but quality may vary . Staffs are nice . Must try Cantonese fried noodles and congee .<->1
food was excellent ! i would come back again of course . i had the mangolian beef and it was excellent . over all their food tasted and looked good !<->1
They have the best Egg Rolls in town . The Wonton Soup is also really good and do n't let me forget kung pao chicken<->2
This place food is over salted and the staff here are incometent . This is NOT a substitute to chipotle .<->0
Delicious and super fast tacos . Friendly staff too . I had the spicy jerk chicken with avocado cream sauce and cilantro and it was excellent . Tacos are small - one is great for a snack , but get multiple for a meal .<->1
Amazing burrito . The chicken is so good and the homemade habanero hot sauce is incredible . I just moved to the neighbourhood and tried this place right away and I am so glad I did .<->1
I love their signature drink with signature boba ! A touch of California to Arizona . Do n't have to go to CA for my boba anymore .<->1
No ambiance , over priced and food had no flavor Save your money and go to the food court in Caesars<->0
I love these guys they 're super friendly the food is omg absolutely great deal than panda and I love the orange chicken it 's super bomb thankS guys<->1
Try there Margherita gelato SOOO amazing<->1
I tried their grilled portobello mushroom thick burger and they were as good as it gets ! Nothing beats anything grilled if it 's grilled with charcoal anyways .<->1
I LOVE this place . LOVE IT . Go , you wo n't regret . In the summer , it 's even better , take a stroll in the Old Port afterwards , bread or whatever else in hand , this will be unforgettable .<->1
ummmmm ... bad food . for the money you pay , go somewhere else . = P<->0
Ok .. this is the real deal folks . If it 's Polish or Ukrainian food you need ... This us the place to go<->1
Flattened , soggy , pretzel breakfast sandwich - nothing like the ad . Just Nasty !<->0
Burnt ends , fresh lemonade and a pulled pork sandwich . I 'm in heaven .<->1
Excellent Indian cuisine . If your in the area you must stop by . Our waiter was also attentive and kind . - 1 star ... I would not say they are child friendly . * loved my coconut mojito mmm .<->1
Huge flavorless portions . Salsa is tomato purée basically . My can of diet coke was fantastic !<->0
Interesting menu ... went there several months back after visiting the Shelby museum and exotic cars across the road - and everything we ordered was great . Wife had the chai tea and loved it . Will definitely return when in the area .<->1
This place is absolutely filthy ! Sadly , the yogurt is good however , the lack of cleanliness in this store will stop us from returning ! It 's a shame !<->0
Service was quick and great .. Food was very good . I had the Cheeseburger Special which is just enough food for me . Atmosphere is pretty quiet despite the ongoing construction in Tryon . I definitely recommend this place for lunch so far .<->1
I have never had a bad experience here staff is always friendly and the gelato is always great . My recommendation is to get the pistachio it 's mine and my wife 's favorite !<->1
Now that they have a delivery service I love them even more ! Your great food delivered downtown Phoenix via BikeForceUS couriers is as " green " as it gets ! RideOn ! ! ! Love you guys :)<->1
Had dinner recently and discovered that it is just a bar . However the waitress did seem genuinely interested in our food and service . Will probably not visit again .<->2
This is an amazing place to eat if you are in Las Vegas strip . Melody the manager is Amazing person . Staff is great and they are super fast . Love the flavor their food and the high quality . Definitely come back .<->1
Food great here , for what you pay ... Diverse menu , attention to presentation , Etc . - - Only problem I had is that a server touched all glass rims with same water pitcher at all tables . Grosses me out I quit drinking the water .<->0
Literally only downloaded the yelp app so that I could rate them 5 stars . Best steak quesadilla I 've ever had , nicest waitress , and an awesome environment . Ca n't wait to go back !<->1
Another amazing Meal at Nora 's . Food was amazing and the staff was very attentive . We tried the rigatoni and it was perfectly cooked with the pasta sauce having an impeccable balance between sweetness and acidity<->1
I miss the Johnny 's of old great food reasonably priced in a funky restaurant . The food is very good and the service exceptional , the interior is stylish . You wo n't be disappointed .<->1
First timer : Jason was my server and he was great . I had the Buffalo chicken tacos with the jalapeño grits . Everything was delicious ... but lets linger on those grits ... they were scrumptious ! ! ! Thanks for the recommendation Jason !<->1
Pamela is a gem ! Zona ' sis my go - to location for essential oils , vape oils , and everything I could need to care for my family in a holistic natural manner .<->1
Best Chinese restaurant in town . We had business trip and stop by here . Really good long list of good choices . Good service . Good food .<->1
Perfect bison burgers ! ! ! Great place to eat . Me and my wife will definitely be going back to try something else .<->1
I know you should not except so much from this establishment but even with lowered standards I very disappointed . Service was slow and I was unable to decider if it was laziness or ignorance on the part of the staff<->0
Adorable space , best latte I have had in my life ( and I have had a lot of lattes ) . A lot of care and attention goes into each drink . Definitely worth going to .<->1
We had a great bartender and received excellent service today at all day happy hour . Margaritas , chips and guacamole , and sports on TV . Great atmosphere and customer service . ( We ca n't recall bartender 's name , but he was from Missouri . )<->1
Great little place in palazzo . The service was 5 stars . I ordered the crawfish pasta which was ok . But the truffle Mac and cheese was amazing . I ca n't eat a normal Mac n cheese anymore . Thx emeryl :D<->1
This place has mediocre food . The service was fine , but the waiter never offered us any Parmesan cheese or pepper for our pasta .<->2
It was alright but not seasoned well especially the fried chicken . I had the collard greens and macaroni and cheese both ok . The greens were good with hot sauce . I will go back again for the fried okra however .<->0
Love this place , it has the best potato cheese soup ever . And Erin that works the register was so sweet , she made sure I got the last bread bowl . The chocolate croissants are wicked good ,<->1
As promised by other Yelpers , this place rocks . Great sandwiches , soups and salads served fast . Prices are Vegas - strip level , so do n't think you will get by for $ 8.00 .<->1
Very authentic mexican , great service and lots of great stuff to take out too .<->1
Love this Greek place ! The gyros are awesome ! Glad to have found it and close to home . Very friendly service .<->1
I used to work here way back in the day they have some good food just the biscuits are very thick with dough laugh out loud . They got good food but with constipation afterwards<->2

Good ambience and neat place.small and enough portions of food servings . Taste was okay , with lot of options on the menu card . Try the inferno menu if you can .<->1
For being at the airport I have to say their food is fantastic . I am a taco freek and their beer battered shrimp tacos are the bomb ! I get them everytime I go to the tthis airport .<->1
Subs are pretty good . Have to eat in . If you take it to go it is still good but the sandwich will be soggy because they steam it and then instantly wrap it up .<->2
Espresso was incredibly sour . Quiche was still cold in the middle . Staff was very friendly .<->0
I ve been coming here for 15years When I 'm on this side of Phx ... Ted n his family will treat you as you are their own family ... very cute hidden Gem ... sandwiches are made when order . # TedThanksForAlwaysLookingOut # AlwaysPacked # GreatFamilyOwnBusiness<->1
I recommend this awesomeness wine / bar Restaurant ... The food is so delicious , I guarantee it ... New management and new Chef<->1

The best tacos in the valley .. Never have been a big fan of tacos until I had a work meeting at guedos ... Now I go weekly ! ! !<->1
Brunch was very good . Waitress was very good . Reasonably priced . Prompt service . Will definitely go back and try their dinner menu . Would recommend<->1
This place is amazing .<->1
A consistently delicious , authentic Mexican cantina - style place with a Dundas East kind of shabbiness to it . These guys do it right .<->1
Great atmosphere , very good coffee . Nice variety of seating areas , especially in the summer when they roll open the garage doors . Five stars because they have sparkling water on tap and free parking !<->1
Great combo of tacos and beer . Tacos for the most part were great . Service was awesome getting samples to try new beers that I had n't tried before . Sat at the bar during lunch .<->1
OK they read my review and improved their salads ! How can I not give them five stars ? Every friend we bring there loves it . They rock and I 'm so happy it 's in my neighbourhood !<->1
A fantastic place for all your fresh baked cakes , cookies , pizzas , loafs ... incredible ! Is my GO TO place ! ! ! ... Always fresh ! Thank you Aida and staff for all your wonderfully baked goods over the years ! ! ! Loyal customer and returning customer for 5 past years ! !<->1
Very poor service , unfriendly , inattentive , food was just barely fair . Once before we were there an never got waited on . This time it was about 10 minutes ..<->0
Surprisingly good food pretty small restaurant but enjoyed the potstickers and chicken fried rice my son really enjoyed the sushi decently priced great for families too .<->1
Five stars because although there was a small problem with our order regarding quality , the manager took care of everything ! Hey , bad things happen sometimes , but the way that first watch handled it more than made up for it .<->1
Good burgers and amazing beer selection . Really liked the live jazz band !<->1
My kids liked creating their own mini donuts but not impressed with the quality ! Nothing to write home about ! !<->2
Great atmosphere and good Japanese food ! Reasonably priced lunch specials . Dinner is a little more expensive . Sushi is surprisingly good for mid - Illinois , and the ramen and udon are rich and satisfying . Celebrate with Sakanaya :)<->1
How 's this they have a huge frigin sign that states BREAKFAST EVERY DAYE AT 8 am ... noose no breakfast . Idiots .<->0
The stars are for the food . Zero stars for the owners . Why do you have to be so unpleasant ? You are in the service industry remember ? If you are trying to be funny stick to baking .<->1
Stopped in for a quick dinner last week and though the wait staff was awesome , the food was just ok . The brisket was a little dry . Could have been a fluke . Will try again due to the great staff .<->2
Great little place off the beaten path . Great place to stop in to eat before a movie . Had the Flam - in - go chicken sandwich which was great . Server was courteous and attentive .<->1
I 'm so impressed with the customer service at this location . The staff is fantastic every time I come . The food is great , too ! I 'll definitely continue to give my business .<->1
They have a really good lunch buffet . Great customer service . The 2 guys working the day I was here were great .<->1
Je cherchais du cafe en grains . Ils ont différentes variétés , force , origine , bio . Personnel sympathique pour vous aider .<->1
I really like how different this grocery store feels . Their deli is amazing and this store seems to want to bring a little bit of every ones favorite hometown grocery item .<->1
Love the pizza and prices are a lot lower than some of the competition . My friends from Calgary love to dine here so make the trip quite often but they agree it could use a facelift .<->1
Amazing food ! Just do n't go when it 's super busy ( ie : occasions like Valentines Day ) - the kitchen is very slow .<->1
The rudest staff I have ever met ! ! ! Would n't have stayed but only tv around to watch football game . Skip this one if u can<->0
Update ... no update . 15 days later and I still have n't received a refund . What horrible management !<->0
By far my favorite sushi place in Henderson ! Never disappoints . Total fav 's are the Grand Canyon Roll , Crunchybug Roll , Screaming O and Tijuana Special . If you love sushi , you will adore Spicy Tuna ! !<->1
3.5 starsSo this place does one thing that is better than anyone else . The marinated duck ... Delicious . Would of gotten 5 stars . But I ca n't find anything else that is good or needs mentioning about<->2
Convenient place . If you want a quick stop to grab some food , its great . Plus on Saturdays , its tax free . Do n't forget to try their bread with meal its pretty nice !<->1
Enjoyed the burger very much . Chicken nuggets were GREASY and their drive thru was frustrating . Bad intercom . A little overpriced , but convenient for the meatless hunger . I 'll give ' em another try .<->2
great taste ? large special beef pho is good for two people . tried chicken roll today , it is great ! more tasty than shrimp roll !<->1
This will sound easier than it will be to execute when you dive into your pasty . Save room for dessert . The chocolate bread pudding ! Holy @ $ # t !<->1
Excellent food , great service that did n't feel snobby , beautiful atmosphere . Worth it !<->1
First time - excellent service & great food . Large portions and a very cute interior . We will be going back !<->1
Their BBQ sauce is on point , all of their meats are tender and delicious ! I want to try everything at SNS ! Next up - Smoked Meatloaf Sandwich ! :D<->1
I tried 3 indian restaurants in north oakland area and this is the best for me . Highly recommand curry and spicy dishes<->1
SO GOOD ! ! Cute place , kid friendly , perfect for a family outing and the food is delicious ! !<->1
They do n't have cinnamon twists , but you can get alcohol and beer that fills from the bottom so that 's a plus . U ique take on taco Bell for sure .<->2
The monkey crepe was worth the wait . Light fluffy batter made a great start to the meal .<->1
Great food and service ! ! The general manager ( Tyler ) and his staff at this location were very friendly and accommodating to my kids food allergies . Overall , the food tasted fresh and satisfying ! !<->1
Our first experience eating here was a great one . Zafran has hands down the best combo of Indian & Pakistani cuisine . The staff and owner were super nice and the food was reasonably priced ! We will be going back again !<->1
Frankly disappointed with this location . I immediately noticed upon walking in the dirty floors , and the fountain drink station ice dispenser was disgusting and covered in grime .<->0
Loved it here ! Beautiful and fun with excellent customer service . Cabanas are the best and you can walk to the outdoor mall . Much better than staying on the strip for sure . Would love to come here again !<->1
Although this is a ramen place , I 've been looking for more places where I can get more flavorful fried rice and this is the place ! I loved the fried rice , black garlic ramen , and potstickers ! So worth the wait !<->1
Just fine . A whole lot better than , say , anything I 'll get in an airport in the States . The son and me had lox and bagel . Yummy . CAD 11.38 - airport pricing , for sure .<->2
Nice lil spot ... Food was ok ... Staff was great and friendly ... But to me something was missing in the sense of what a deli has ... Overall not bad , I'dGo back<->2
SIMPLY the Best ! ! Old world charm and delicious food . HIGHLY recommended to anyone and every - DELICIOUS ! ! !<->1
Great Poke ! Awesome flavor combinations you wo n't be disappointed ! ! ! So good this place rocks . Thanks for the poke up north Scottsdale way ! ! !<->1
Great Sandwich shop , been to this location on the last 2 trips to Vegas . Great value . lots of meat on sandwiches , Excellent service both times , especially from Dawn . we Need Capriottis in Los Angeles ! ! !<->1
Wonderful sushi at buy 2 get one free . Alaska my favorite . Crab patty okay but hubby loved it ! Tempura bananas with ice cream are great .<->1
Quality food for the price . The staff is lively and the atmosphere is attractive for family . Would recommend if you are a burger person ! Santa Barbara burger was on point .<->1
Loved this spot ! All the variety of sauces . Great chicken . Perfect to stop before heading back to Phoenix .<->1
Some of the people that work there are rude and rude to customers of certain persuasions ... Very average food<->0
Best Indian food downtown ! ! ! I 'm a carnivore so the meat platter is what I get all the time . Great service as well . Only down side is that the place is small .<->1
I 've been here once for brunch , once for dinner , and once for lunch . I enjoy sharing it with people . Pros : - great wine list - breakfast is delicious - PB & J French Toast is a must - get - Farmer 's Choice quesadilla w / caramelized onions - friendly service - large portions<->2
Worst service ever . Did n't even get silverware or napkins for the table . Waited 15 minutes for a box . Food was ok atmosphere fun . Would n't waste my time or money again<->0
Great choice for a quick bite . Gyro was delicious . He had Beef and hot dog combo dipped . It was so so good .<->1
Decent food , great service ... pad Thai was solid , green curry was flavorful , would not go out of the way for it but good Thai spot and nice decor .<->1
Came in for Sunday Brunch and my service and the food was wonderful . Such a great staff that really make you feel at home . Thanks Sugar Jam for making our Sunday Brunch so memorable .<->1
Good service . Cool concept with the birds . I Loved the turkey club sandwich , it was by far one of my favorite !<->1
Great sandwiches ... an oasis in a desert of dining ... go here if you want a great meal at a reasonable price ...<->1
Great food and service . We had the spicy burger and roasted chicken and it was very good . A good place for a date , friday night out , or even work happy hour .<->1
Love the outdoor patio and the service is second to none ... Food is decent ; I recommended the Chicago burrito ! ! !<->1
Awesome place great ambiance ! Our waiter Lorenzo was amazing ! ! The green beans rock and so does creative drink menu !<->1
Went just for a Sundae . They are huge ! ! ! Unless you 're are Profesional eater plan on sharing one of there sundaes . Amazing quality in presentation to the ingredients .<->1
Nachos were bomb . Margaritas were strong ! Scorpion shot was interesting , got nice shot glass to take home .<->1
I had a buffalo burger on ciabatta , with swiss cheese , caramelized onions , avocado AND guacamole ( because that 's how I roll ) , jalapeno bacon , homemade dijon and cole slaw . With a side of beer . 5 stars .<->1
Easily one of the best sushi places I have been to . Always fresh , service is amazing and so reasonable . My favourite choice is the dynamite dragon roll , or the chicken fried rice .<->1
Great steaks and great service . A little on pricey side despite the $ $ $ signs , although it did come with a side . my wife and I split the 22 oz Ribeye and was plenty of food .<->1
Oh the pork Vermicelli , it 's the best . I tried different Phos , the only one worth eating was the veggie one . It 's a good place to try out .<->1
So happy since this moved to the Atwood neighborhood . Great service , very friendly staff . Plenty of wine tasting events . Enough space to sit . Definitely my favorite Barriques !<->1
Overrated ! The taste is good I do not like their lay out an their customer service needs more training . Not my type of tacos or environment .<->0
This place is intimate and modern . An upscale sushi place . Very fresh . Creative , great service . Small bar but friendly ( 4 or 5 people max ) . They have a full bar . Feels local and friendly .<->1
Excellent authentic middle eastern food . The vegetarian platter is my favorite . The falafel and hummus is outstanding .<->1
Food was good but service was terrible . Our server did n't do anything besides take our orders , and the place was empty ! Not at all the service that we had expected .<->2
Drinks are way underpriced for how delicious they are . The setting is casual , a little loud but perfect spot for late night drinks . Definitely ask for Tim . Bomb ass bartender . # drinkbetter<->1
Great atmosphere , the staff always remembers return customers , they could not be any nicer and the food , amazing . I could eat there every day !<->1
Stopped by for lunch today . Chose the moussaka and an espresso . The moussaka was incredible ! The owner , Dmitri , is very friendly . I will be back .<->1
New remodel . They are doing a great job but it 's just too big for me . I must just be getting lazy but it 's almost like going to Walmart . Nice staff .<->1
Delicious . Simply delicious . Loved the fried chicken , fried shrimp , fries and slaw we ordered . Nothing was too greasy even though it was fried . I definitely recommend this place if you need a fried chicken fix .<->1
Smiling Banana Leaf is Delicious ! Red Curry Noodles , Pumpkin Curry with Tofu , Mango Curry with vegetables , & Spicy Green Beans all are Fantastic ! When I get back into town this will be a definite stop ! ! !<->1
Phenomenal food ... I recommend the yellow tail fish tacos , Serrano Chicken Wings and lobster fried rice . The service was awesome . A must go when you 're in Las Vegas .<->1
Excellent service , and great atmosphere ! Fun Fun Fun ! Great family safe environment !<->1
your favorite Israeli food can be found here ... always fresh , can not go wrong . we always coming back while in Vegas<->1
Do nt go there early in morn . They do nt serve chicken till 10:30 . Good donuts . Maybe will try again but its long drive to find that out especially in rush hour<->2
Great dinner . Easily one of the best in my life . Great service , excellent food . Make sure you share . Get appetizers . Lobster tacos were to die for !<->1
Seaweed salad and mackerel nigiri were fantastic . Salmon nigiri was not the best cut of fish . Ponzu sauce was some of the best I 've had in a while . Would definitely come back next time I 'm in town .<->1
We love the pho at Pho King ! This place is clean and the food is really , really good . A must try<->1
I love this place . The custard is really great . I tried a chocolate sundae with caramel . Very filling ! I wish this place was closer to where I live .<->1
Awful service as we entered , we were told the only availability was at the bar in a rude manner ignored and shunned away . Very rude and will not return ..<->0
Awesome and my favorite place in Phoenix to eat sushi . The prices are just like any other sushi place which will run from 9 & up in each roll . The staff & chefs are amazing ! Great service and great food .<->1
The sushi were really great . The crunch lobster is my new favorite . I will be definitely be recommending friends and family here .<->1
Very friendly excellent food serenaded by a guitar player who is very good food was excellent price was right<->1
Love love love the Brew Kettle . Great beers , great food , great prices . Now that they have expanded they have lost a little of that hole in the wall charm , but still worth the visit .<->1
Fried twinkies and fried Oreos ! ! ! Do I need to say anything else ? I think not ! Ok , their hot dogs are pretty good . Tell the bartender that the drinks are weak and they 'll throw in more liquor ...<->1
Service is always great as could be ! Food is delicious ! ! I 'm such a picky person with my food they always accommodate to any changes I need :)<->1
Excellent is absolutely great staff and the food over the top be ready to take some home with you ! :)<->1
Tastes like chinese food in most restauants . Egg drop soup had no flavor too .<->0
I love love love this Japanese food restaurant ! Try okonomiyaki is so delish ! Also lots of menu to choose from ... my favorite is salmon avocado bowl with daikon oroshi with tempura and ikura ! Sooooooooo fresh and authentic yummy Japanese style food !<->1
So good ! Had the Mikey burger , sweet potato fries and fries with gravy . The burger was amazing . Fries were good , but I think I 'd try the onion rings next time - they looked amazing .<->1
Wish it was better ... how can a business stay open that has worse Mexican food than Taco Bell ... Cook was unfriendly . .. food was bland ... Margaritas were good .<->0
Great pizza and their delivery staff are really nice and very prompt . I 'm glad they are here .<->1
Really good atmosphere , very classy and nice for a date . The baseball top cut sirloin was amazing with the asian coleslaw . Match it with a Pinot Noir Mont Pellier , you will not regret it ! ! !<->1
The all you can eat is great for the price . I think they have a few good dishes along with decent sushi . My only complaint about this place is just slow service .<->1
Soda was ok . That s about it . I 'm not mad , just dissapointed . This brand carries a power that i do n't quite understand .<->0
Great service , food , and view . What more could you ask for ? We really had a terrific meal and enjoyed our view of the city . We enjoyed the Charcuterie and Fromage starter followed by crab cakes and Osso Bucco - all terrific .<->1
I ordered a regular Oreo blizzard and a royal oreo blizzard , the guy working repeated our order wrong so I corrected him and I still got the wrong blizzard<->0
LOVE THIS PLACE ! Me and my boyfriend try to come in about once a week . The food is amazing . We get the yellow curry and the chicken pad thai , YUM<->1
Great place for breakfast ! Frequented by locals and very popular . The Smoked Salmon Lox and Café con Leche were Excellent ! A bit of an Industrial atmosphere but still friendly . Highly recommend . This is a Second Amendment Friendly establishment .<->1
Miss Zen 32 so glad to be able to have their sushi still ! Beet salad is also yum in addition to some of their cocktails . I no longer drink beer , but they have a great list !<->1
Went here with some friends visiting from out of town and everything was great . The service was consistent , the food was great , sufficient and not small portions . Definitely recommend to others !<->1
Wonderful , professional experience with Sandra ! ! Highly recommend her and her staff . Food was delicious and presentation was exquisite . When back in Phoenix , I will call Sandra again ! thank you ! !<->1
Cool little barista . Original decor and friendly staff . Nice hangout to work or socialize .<->1
Had dinner here 3x in the past five weeks with my family ( 4 ppl total ) - wait time , service , drinks and food have been great each time !<->1
In from out of town . Great pizza ! ! ! Love the thin crust . Had the chicken Caesar also . Very good food .<->1
Incredible food . Amazing service . Informative employees who genuinely care and know what they 're doing . Do yourself a favor and fill up on all this goodness<->1
My banana walnut was stale and tasted like a cardboard box . The peanut butter cheese cake tasted spoiled and the lemonade was warm and bitter .<->0
The staff is very attentive and friendly ! Housekeeping was awesome and accommodating ! Love this stay !<->1
Delicious food and wonderful service ! I would say the cramped seating is the main downside . Also would n't recommend for deep conversation due to loudness but I feel that is expected in any place open til 11 .<->1
Rip off 100 % . No mention that they are inside Sunset Station . Ordered 2 pizzas and it came to 55.00 . Not happy with tgem . Nor YELP<->0
The french onion soup tasted burnt . The mussels were gritty . The bread was delicious . The service was great . Nice decor . Loud .<->1
It has been many years since we first tried - much much better - going to visit again - Tim sum that is close by is a plus<->1
Miso Salmon is simply amazzzing ! ! ! Do nt have to mention regarding cheescakes ! Always busy ! ! !<->1
We have tried every pizza place in Hampton / Gibsonia area . Bruno 's is the best . Family owned business - they are very nice and have a very nice place .<->1
After more than 5 minutes waiting for any servers we decided to leave . At least an acknowledgement would have been nice .<->0
Simply delectable . Just saw the owner on donut showdown and reminded me of how delicious the creme brûlée and salted caramel doughnuts are . I . Must . Have . One . Now .<->1
So far one of the best I have tasted , the inside was soft and outside was crunchy . Strongly recommended over any other egg waffle place .<->1
Great food and great ambiance ! Staff is knowledgeable of their menu options and on queue . Food is delicious and fresh - highly recommend this Steak and Seafood establishment !<->1
My go - to place for sushi in yorkville . Reasonably priced and fresh . Spicy salmon rolls are really yummy . Always really busy but do n't have to wait too long for a table .<->1
Excellent selection with knowledgeable staff ! Gorgonzola & apple flatbread was delicious - way better than you would expect from a bar ! Would definitely go again !<->1
Ordered Pho . It comes out piping hot as it should be ! The flavourful broth is a delight to the tastebuds and the prompt service keeps me going back for more .<->1
Probably the best Halal Location me and my boyfriend have been to . Super friendly staff and quick service !<->1
Awesome spot in Vegas . Meals are super cheap but are awesome quality . My favorite spot to chow down near the strip .<->1
Amazing service ! C . C . has a great personality and I come back because of her ... the foods a plus too !<->1
This is definitely in my top 5 favorite sushi restaurant for how fresh the food is and how fantastic the staff is .<->1
I vegan bites .. Even , I 'm a paleo eater .. Perfect place for me to go and get some sweets ..<->1
Great french food , chef is great ! The only thing I did n't really like was the place by itself , pretty cold and to quiet ... beside that , service was ok and food was amazing<->1
Food is great , been coming here since i discovered this place in middle school back in maybe 2002 ? it became a spot in high school for Durango students , only downside is they do nt have dr pepper like they used too<->1
They closed ! ! ! Nooooooooooo ! That 's so sad , they had such good food . Maybe open up again in a different place ?<->1
It 's a Vegas staple for me now . Food is incredible and the prices are more than fair for the volume you get . I 'll hit here every time I can .<->1
Always great service and food one of the best places to eat around the area great wings hoagies and sides<->1
Shannon is awesome , very attentive to her customers and makes the best drinks .<->1
Food is clean and portion size is reasonable . Food quality is equivalent to that of yonge and finch . Highly recommended .<->1
Wonderful gluten free menu . We 've ordered here quite a bit . Gf pizza is very good and the gluten free wings are GREAT . Hits the spot for gluten free fried chicken too .<->1
Best macaroons around period ... great selection . .. will be back here definitely make it a stop when ypur at arrowhead mall ...<->1
Nothing really fancy about this light rail stop . It was clean when I was there . No one really creepy . Machines worked just fine . All in all it had everything I wanted from a light rail stop .<->1
Whenever I 'm in town I always bring the family through here . The food is ono , the people are nice , and the price is not bad .<->1
Went there with the kids this morning again , we had Nicole as our server , excellent service , food always great , kids enjoy their breakfast , this place is always be our number choice for brunch<->1
Very good food ... Service is rather snotty . I 've had things thrown in bags and never a thank you . I 've waiting 10 minutes for soup with nobody in the place .<->0
This McDonald 's is pretty scary but for a cheap fish sandwhich I 'll go in . Currently they are doing a Lentin special of $ 1 fish on Fridays .<->2
Finally some great food at the RVH Glen site . They have noodles , pork , rice curry and more . It 's a great new spot . Speak to Frederick one of the co owners and he will give you great service !<->1
The shepherds pie , grilled cheese with Mac and cheese and the champ potatoes were very tasty . My son is still talking about the potatoes !<->1
Truly a poor level of service ... yes it was 2AM ... but regardless ... take pride in what you do . Step your game up ... change the WHOLE direction you are going in at this location Jack ... do better .<->0
Great pizza with plentiful and interesting combination options . Great all - around pizza place . Garlic fries are addicting ! So excited to get a location in the NW soon !<->1
FORGET PITA JUNGLE . I know i have 5 star reviews for the , but this is so much better ! Chicken Schwarma was BOMB ! ! I will be making this a weekly or biweekly thing with my Girlfriends daughter .<->1
I went looking for a puffy taco like I 'd find in San Antonio , TX . Close but not the same . Indian fry bread was a little breadier than I hoped for but still pretty darn good !<->1
They make some delicious cookies and deserts . I love Sweetcakes and occassionaly they will host local band shows there during the summer . I<->1
Had breakfast with friends and enjoyed food , service & venue . One downside is the nigh level of noise from the small area . I would definitely go back again .<->1
Not a fan . Go to Total Wine instead - much cheaper & great options .<->0
Took close to two hours for delivery . Multiple phone calls . Food taste was bad . pizza was lukewarm . Overall taste was bad . Never ordering again !<->0
Not that well stocked to be a real convenience store . A very very good craft beer and wine store . A tiny bar too . Dude at the counter was super friendly and helpful .<->1
Although the service was excellent , the prices were very high for the quality of food we received . Portions were small and my fish was bland and not very tasty . It was surprising and disappointing .<->0
Great food and atmosphere . Wait times are way too long . Get there early and prepare to wait . They also no longer have Coca Cola products but this cane sugar Cola . It is fine but left me dissatisfied .<->2
This place is a great Parkdale gem , freshly baked naan , the best tikka masala and the loveliest wait staff keep me going back .<->1
We are in town for the weekend , and went on another Yelp review . Fresh and excellent ! Great protein box . Delicious sushi . Must try !<->1
Very enjoyable experience at this location of Mint . Food is simply perfect and the service very friendly . A fun place for a great Indian food experience .<->1
No matter what time of day we 've gone to get donuts , they are delicious ! Employees are all so friendly !<->1
It is a little or if the way but well worth it . Fantastic gyros . Super friendly service . Decent prices . I 'm going to make this a regular place for lunch .<->1
By far the best breakfast place I have been to in a really long time ! The service , food and drinks were outstanding ! I highly recommend , great for big groups , families or just a girls brunch !<->1
I have been to many Denny 's and this location particularly has poor customer service and long wait time for your orders . Not sure what happen to them ... probably will never come back to this location .<->0
Everyone talks about their pizza 's , but they forget about the other wonderful things on the menu - like their salads ! They have seasonal salads that are heavenly . Go for either - and you 'll definately enjoy this place .<->1
Great location . Okay food . Kinda overpriced .<->2
The food served at China A Go Go is outstanding . The portions are large and the service is swift . My favorite is Honey Walnut Shrimp<->1
This place offers a really unique type of flavor for hot pot . My favorite is still seafood and be sure to utilize the sauce they have available at the back . And the customer service is always excellent .<->1
Mike was a great server . Fast service and great recommendations . The rooftop has an awesome view . Good beer selection and lots of things to do . Thanks again Mike !<->1
Charming old - fashioned soda fountain just north of downtown Phoenix . Fun atmosphere . Great place to take the family . Try the turtle sundae -- outstanding !<->1
Just had lunch at the sandbar . Luck was fresh and delicious . Like a favorite pair of old shoes , you just can not throw away . Familiar and comfortable !<->1
Good cofee and there s always something yummy to eat together<->1
just hit this place once , but prolly gon na go back , they have tequila offers or promo , clean space , a bit crowded , with lots of games to play , with patio , good music , and good staff ...<->2
The best Sonoran dogs in town ! Amazing flavor , quick service , and not too expensive .<->1
Tried two different kinds of rolls and both were good . They are bigger pieces than most places serve . Have half price sushi on We d and Fri . Would go back again .<->1
Speedy and professional service . I like the healthier menus . Quinoa Asparagus with Grilled Chicken was my fave .<->1
The Best Panzerotti in the world . Have been coming here for over 25 years and I ca n't say that I have ever had a bad meal . Everything is so fresh and you could feel the love of the food ! !<->1
Second time here and still great . I love that they offer a free drink while waiting . They really provide great service and a really good wash . Thanks .<->1
Totally indifferent food . Way too sweet and mostly little flavor . Poured wine way to much to pas check<->0
Wow , 2 lines . This McDonalds is efficient and got my order correct .<->1
Nice Belgian draft selection and decent food after a long travel day .<->2
I love shopping at this store because the employees are always very polite and happy to help . I got Starbucks and the barista was very nice and great at what she does ! I loved my drink ! Thank you Carigan !<->1
the worst Dosa and a terrible excuse for Indian food in a city that has many great options ...<->0
Centra is great . Simple clean Asian grocery store that saves me the trip down to Scarborough ... Great environment great service great selection . A great addition to the community<->1
If you can make good Pasta at Home , save your cash . If not this place is OK .<->2
Always great food , friendly service . Go for the ribs , come back to try something else ; trust me . Burgers and wings are amazing ! Little dining area , open kitchen . Can call ahead for pickup orders .<->1
There 's a reason this was voted as one of the best brewery in the us . The food is always fantastic and the rotating beers will always have me wanting to come back .<->1
Beef Roll very goodSalt and Pepper was SolidFish in Hot chili oil was home run Dumplings were goodCrispy Beef was deliciousService was spot on !<->1
For the price , quality , and location , you honestly ca n't beat Billy 's ! Absolutely on par with some of the " best " bbq places around town .<->1
What a disappointment . The food at brunch was average at best and the service was horrible . The mandatory tip they made me pay for a group of 6 was undeserved . I will never go here again .<->0
I loved this restaurant ! I was helped by a man named Joan and received great service and great food , what more would you ask for !<->1
Great Vegan food joint , much more flavorful than other spots . My wife loves it here ! .<->1
You just ca n't go wrong with a Dairy Queen chocolate dipped cone . I 'll confess , the special waffle cone bowl sundae with strawberry and hot fudge was pretty tempting , but ... call me a creature of habit ( go ahead , I dare ya ! )<->1
Presently surprised ! It 's not the easiest place to find but this is a gem . Food and service was excellent . This is must stop if you 're visiting Phoenix<->1
Me and my hunny love this place ! ! Food is amazing and the staff is amazing ! ! We come here at least once a week and have never been disappointed !<->1
Terrible service . My husband waited for + 20 minutes for 2 smoothies while another lady after my husband ordered received hers .<->0
I stopped in here Sunday for a beer . My friend wanted a gluten free beer but had to settle for a cider . I tried their orange blossom beer and it was just OK .<->2
Yum ! Great food ! I had the chicken burrito which was great ! Next time , I 'll ask for rice to be included in the burrito though . Our friends had green chile burritos and loved them !<->1
This is a must try . We eat here everytime we come to vegas . Their chicken fajitas are deelish and endless chips & salsa ensure that you end up in a food coma . It 's just that good .<->1
Very quaint neighborhood restaurant . Awesome wine and tapas . Definitely get the figs wrapped in prosciutto and smoked salmon panini . Our server Olivia was awesome .<->1
Pretty well executed Asian fusion burger . The pho soup goes do well with the burger . Yum !<->1
Lovely carne asada . I go for the breakfast carne asade burrito most often , as it has more of a kick to it than the regular . Close to ASU Tempe campus . Friendly people , who remember regulars !<->1
We love this place for the music , food , and events ... not to mention the football Sundays . Wear your colors .<->1
Great food . Fantastic service . Macaroni balls were to die for ! Wedge salad and philly sliders were fabulous ! ! Highly recommended ! !<->1
Craft , you 've redeemed yourself ! I 've been to Craft many times over the past several months , and have always had a great time . Excellent beer selection , and delicious food .<->1
Who is managing this place . , better get his head out of his butt . Went there today , no ice cream of any kind , , completely out of every flavor ? ? ?<->0
The food was amazing , however I had to clean my own seat and counter which was kinda like wtf .. the guy handed me a rag to clean my own seat .<->0
Just the best mexican food i have ever eaten . Not exactly inexpensive , but sometimes you get what you pay for . I will definitely be back !<->1
Worth EVERY penny ! ! ! the food & service are amazing ! ! The sandwiches are perfect the pickles are perfect & the cheesecake ohhhhh my ! ! !<->1
This is my favorite all you can eat sushi spot in Vegas ! The staff is nice , the sushi is fresh and they have such a great variety ! My husband and I love this place !<->1
Pretty good . Becareful , they will try very hard to upsell you big time , esp with water !<->2
Very nice restaurant . Food was fantastic . Forgot to take pictures of a lot of the items but everything i had was awesome . Everything from sushi to hot food from the kitchen was excellent . Highly recommend this spot .<->1
O stars ! ! ! too expensive . rice noodle - too small portion . ( where Is noodle ? ) Beef - very bad . charge $ 5 for extra rice noodle . Didn ' t order . Paid $ 19 for small pho . I like pho . The worst pho .. Soup - ok but it was warm . Not hot . :(<->0
Two great courses and of course the annual Waste Management Open . Probably the single rowdiest event on the PGA .<->1
Down Home in Phoenix ! Be prepared for some culture shock and forget about your diet for the day . Great southern cooking in a funky building ... interesting atmosphere , with customer graffiti on the walls . Worth a try for the experience !<->1
I go to Black Bear every time I 'm in California or Nevada . It 's my favorite diner . Great food and the portions are gigantic ! All with a very reasonable price .<->1
Food is just ok nothing really special so I am so surprised by all the great reviews . Restaurant is small and they do n't have proper ventilation so you leave smelling like fried food . Wo n't be coming back .<->0
Went to Karl 's Quality Bakery n bought a peach fruit tart ! DISCUSTING ! The crust was the color of Captain Crunch cereal n Mushyy ! Plus no custard between crust n fruit ! Threw the whole thing out ! * No pastry cream<->0
Great food . Great customer service . I even met with the General Manager who has such a wonderful perspective on the restaurant and the hospitality industry in general . With such a leader , it is no wonder Therapy is doing so well !<->1
Such an incredible experience . I have been twice now , both times doing the chef 's tasting ( highly recommend ! ) . Food was delicious , service was impeccable and I recommend this place to anyone I know when they are visiting Las Vegas !<->1
By far the fish sandwich in Pittsburgh . Cod on soft . Do it .<->1
Great for lunch or late night snacking . Smoked meat poutine is delicious and competes with the best in Montreal .<->1
Worst sound and hidden fee . Charged for 30 % service fee which was not shown on the bill .<->0
New to the area we took a party of twelve for a special family event . Petros and his team did a great job , and his Mom even made a special Greek dessert . A must visit in the Upper Beaches !<->1
If I feel like grabbing a good bar burger this is easily my first choice ! ! They are juice monsters and the bartender 's are always very nice ,<->1
Food is average at best and service is hit or miss . Been here a few times ... never walked away impressed .<->0
Met a friend here , for a quick cup of coffee . The cafe is located at a nice location . The interior is decent and basic . Coffee was excellent .<->2
The best Indian restaurant in charlotte by far . The food is authentic and flavorful . The service is very attentive and helpful in explaining everything . You have got to try this place if you appreciate the flavors of India .<->1
I come here every time I 'm in Cleveland ! We saw the reviews on yelp and knew we had to try the lemon ricotta pancakes . They 're just as amazing as everyone says they are !<->1
It takes 30 mins for my one drink . there is four people working there . it takes forever for my drink . Popcorn chicken is too dry .<->0
A very friendly service , fair prices for very good foods . We were 6 and we all said that they are the best omelet and best pancakes we 've ever had<->1
Great lil ' late night lounge with fabulous cocktail selections and fantastic DJ ! Love it !<->1
Love love love Lo Lo 's chicken and waffles . I 've been here multiple times and it 's great every time . You know a place is gon na be great when a place has kool aid especially when you can mix it with lemonade .<->1
My family and I had a late lunch here today it was terrific . The wait time was not that bad and the sweet tea was the best . If you go please get the banana pudding you love it !<->1
Awesome breakfast . Always order the stuffed shredded hashbrowns with my chorizo beni . I always order my chorizo beni on special corn bread . Taste greaaat !<->1
Every time I have gone there they have always been very nice I love their ice cream nutty coconut and bubblegum I recommend this place<->1
Best tea place in town . Service is amazing ; they never fuss when you want adjustments to your drink . A lot better than Tea Station ! ! ! The line gets long on the weekend but there 's always Kung fu clips to enjoy !<->1
Delicious empanadas and now they have arepas as well , authentic and great . Also they have guanabana juice , passion fruit juice , and guasacaca sauce ! To die for , highly recommended<->1
Excellent service and good food :) We will be coming back ( especially to try the fried ice cream ) .<->1
Highly over priced for Red Lodster style food . I paid $ 22.00 for 3 shrimp and 2 scallops . Serously better food Joes crab Shack .<->0
Amazing food ! ! I normally do n't enjoy eating gyros but something about this place makes it special . The atmosphere is amazing and the employees are all very friendly ! ! They 're open late which is amazing . I highly recommend eating here ! !<->1
irmas kitchen is a small little place but the service and food was unbelievable delicious will be back when passing through phoenix .<->1
My 20th time here . My favorite downtown . Watermelon salad and jerk turkey burger are my go to 's but there 's so many great items on the menu . Beer menu is far above average for a downtown lunch spot .<->1
Great little place . Been here a handful of times . Service and food get two thumbs up .<->1
Best Pies in Kensington market . The soups are really good too . Great<->1
One of the few gas stations in Vegas that does n't sell 40 oz beers or single tall cans . Everyone else in town does , why do n't you fools sell it ?<->0
If you want to receive terrible service , go here . Food is n't anything to write home about but the service was unreal ! They acted like we did n't exist . For Lebanese food , go somewhere else ! !<->0
Ordered the fried chicken for take out . Was great but I 'm sure even better in restaurant . Did the spicy and the green onion . Looking forward to going back .<->1
Incredible food and impeccable service . We had the Porterhouse and it was the best I have ever had .<->1
What an excellent little business . Christian ; the owner is a nice guy welcomed me into his store . He has a great product and I wo n't hesitate to come here next time I 'm in Vegas . I highly recommend it !<->1
From the service , Sherry , to the food , Chilean sea bass and the chocolate ball ... everything was excellent ! Definitely 5 stars !<->1
We had excellent service . The main dishes were delicious , yet not that large , but the superb desserts made up for that ! Their bread and pizza dough with beer in it are to die for .<->1
I eat here all the time ! The service and food are always consistent and the staff are friendly and upbeat . It 's always busy , making for a lively atmosphere .<->1
We love Zupas . The Lobster Bisque is awesome and my wife loves the tomato basil . This place is great , try it out !<->1
Their ice cream cookies are to die for . The coffee is pretty good too .<->1
Really good thai food with quick service . Portion sizes are decent . Average pricing .<->1
Really good salad and fresh ingredients . You can build your own salad too , nice for calorie counting ! !<->1
I so enjoyed my enchilada plate . Their salsa is so fresh and their chips are extra yummy as well . The server was very friendly and quick to take our order and refill our drinks !<->1
The steak and egg bagel is phenomenal ! I had it once on a whim and went back to get it again for myself and boyfriend 3 days later ! The vibes and overall aesthetic are also amazing !<->1
Love the vibe of the rooftop patio it is really nice in summer . Service is also always fast and nice . Food is delicious . And the sangria glasses are absolutely worth it ! ! ! Would definitely recommend !<->1
If you are looking for New York Spanish food here 's the place . And if you go around lunch time the price is right . I can eat here every day .<->1
Meh ... Not sure what all the fuss is about .. If you want a lot of fries go for it .. Burger was n't that special .. My bread was soggy too ..<->2
I really like their food , and they do n't whine about taking / delivering orders , even if it 's close to opening or closing time ! What more could you ask for from a pizza place ?<->1
Wonderful food ! We did take out . The food was fresh , hot and exactly the correct level of spice . The summer rolls were amazing !<->1
Rainy and amber are super sweet ! Have awesome salads and wings it 's got great home like feeling . Every time each persons is so nice to me and my daughter<->1
Great place to shop for Asian flair and cuisine . Prices are reasonable . Convenient location . Friendly staff .<->1
My new favorite spot ! Great pizza and the slices are huge ! I 've eaten here almost everyday for the past week<->1
Your new York location is much better . You worry about filling up your customers rather than having them savour your meals .<->0
Fantastic happy hour ! Ordered a cocktail , beer , two orders of sushi ( eight rolls in each order ) , and edamame all for under $ 20 . Server forgot our 2nd beer but otherwise service was very fast . Food was excellent .<->1
The prices ca n't be beat . For 3 dollars you can enjoy almost any sub on the menu . The bread is baked fresh and so is the other baked goods .<->1
Coca Cafe is my favorite brunch at Pittsburgh ! The special menu for Sunday brunch is worthy to try . I will suggest my friends try savory meals , because it 's really awesome !<->1
Been here multiple times ~ has the best ice - cream and cupcakes I 've ever tried . Nice vegan options and beautifully decorated cakes<->1
Hot beef dip sandwich became lukewarm by the time it got to the table . Grilled chicken sandwich tasted like reheat ! Nothing worse than that . Noisy place with bad acoustics so that even out server had trouble communicating with us .<->0
Raymond knows friendly atmosphere , awesome deco , and the food / specials just right to my taste Gracias ! ! !<->1
Staff is very nice . Greeted us when we entered iNside . The young man who took our order was friendly . It was n't busy considering this is a highway stopover place . We did n't wait too long for our order . Clean bathrooms .<->2
One of our GoTo 's whenever we are in Vegas . Shellfish platter is the bomb ! Ask for server Stacey . She 'll make your night enjoyable ! Great personality !<->1
Definitely my favorite sub shop . Excellent flavors and portions . I really need to eat at Fire House Subs more often .<->1
Came back here after a disappointing visit and my experience was much better . The pasta was cooked to perfection this time , and service was friendly . Glad I came back and gave this place another chance .<->1
If you 're looking to have a wildly overpriced lukewarm Japanese lunch , this place is for you . The disgust for the price is only matched by the lackluster service ! Ugh .<->0
Tasty crêpes .. but not amazing ... there is something " weird " about their texture of crêpes . . but pretty average in Toronto<->1
great food , quick service , a very comfortable setting , i 'd recommend to anyone in the area .<->1
There 's was n't much things on the menu . Went for my birthday dinner , ended up leaving and going to a different restaurant . Overall , the restaurant and lounge was very nice inside .<->2
Excellent Kerala food , especially fish curry and mutton fry .. Reminds me of my mom 's cooking . We live about 45 minutes from this place but it was worth the drive and we will be coming back often ..<->1
Not surprised bye how many reviews this place has .. This place is bomb ... I get the chicken burrito with rice and beans ... Love this place<->1
This place is amazing . Jeff the executive chef is ridiculous . My steak was beyond perfect . The shrimp was exceptional . Service was as expected , promptThis is the best !<->1
Carlito 's is crazy delicious . I really like their food . Eating it is great . Their hatch green chiles make things delicious and spicy .<->1
My favorite place for korean bbq ! The have a wide selection of meats , my favorites were the bulgogi and beef tongue . Their banchan is also better than tofu hut . The restaurant is very clean and modern .<->1
Whole foods makes me feel whole and I have forever grateful for their bakery especially<->1
First time there today they where friendly and fast and they have almond milk to make the drinks with big win o and the girls where cute .<->1
Went there on a Sunday night , hoping to grab a beer before calling it the night . Horrible service and no one bother to serve . Ruined my great impression of Montreal . Do n't waste time and money .<->0
As always AMAZING ! The service was Our meal was cooked to perfection my steak was mouth watering . The potato 's Are my favorite and they never disappoint ! ! !<->1
Ate here twice during vacation ! The Loco Moco is one of the best ! The Spam Musubi was perfect and at a good price ! Definetly coming back !<->1
This place has awesome food with unique flavors ! I definitely recommend that everybody come here and check it out ! !<->1
Pleasantly cozy but modern ... Good food and service ... Recommended highly for Friday Saturday night priming ...<->1
Customer Service is so so good . They treat you like family . Preparadas , pozole , mole , muchacha all amazing choices . Will definitely be back !<->1
Great place . Good TVs for games . Server was excellent . The food was much better than " bar food " and we enjoyed everything that we ordered . Would def go back .<->1
Great draft beer selection , wings are top notch and often on a daily special . Soft Pretzels also good along with burgers .<->1
Jennifer rocks ! ! ! She is awesome , very friendly , the best server ! ! The bottomless mimosas were the bomb ! ! And the hostesses Corine and Marissa are so nice and sweet , they 're the best hostesses ! !<->1
This place is alright for airport food . The brown rice was good and the kung pap chicken was pretty spicy . My order took a long time to receive , but they were busy .<->2
Everything you 've heard is true . Go , and go now . This one is also way less crowded than the Strip location , so it 's worth the Uber / cab fare .<->1
We are visiting from our of town . The food is fresh and healthy . Plenty of choices ! Great place !<->1
Friendly service and fresh amazing food make this gem stand out ... and the trendy container park is a welcome respite from the frenzied kitsch of Fremont Street and the Strip .<->1
Pizza was okay ! Went at 9:30 pm on a Friday night after leaving a movie at AMC ! I did not care for the $ 2 peanut butter cookie !<->0
Awesome food and service . Great music , food was delicious . Service was fast , drinks were great . Glad we stopped here . Marcus was an awesome server and made sure we had everything we needed .<->1
Lappert 's Ice Cream is a must when you 're downtown Vegas . $ 3 for a big scoop of ice cream ? Come on , what 's not to love ?<->1
Slightly better than Panera but just as overpriced .<->2
Best sushi we have eaten in a long time and the service was fast and excellent . The AZ caterpillar was awesome . Highly recommend this place .<->1
Best sushi in Pittsburgh ! They have great hibachi too ( it was unavailable for a while ) . The staff is very friendly . I go here regularly and it 's definitely one of my favorite places in the area .<->1
The lunch specials are so worth it . Yes the place is small and loud but it 's really worth it for their jerk chicken . The coslaw is to die for . Just try it .<->1
Great beer . Great food . Must get the pretzel ! Staff is super nice . Seating is limited but service is fast .<->1
Excellent service and delicious food ! Affordable prices . They adjusted my order just the way I wanted it , and gave us extra .<->1
Tried the beef brisket sandwich with the pepper and onions . Yum ... delish ! ! The staff was very friendly .<->1
They have student specials every day ... but the place is sooooo dirty and filthy that I would never go back again .<->0
Pizza was excellent . Charred crust typical of New York style pizza . We had the Gotham and added mushrooms which was delicious . The shakes were very good with the option to add liquor to .<->1
This is a great lunch option . The food is fresh and delicious . Location is clean and casual . I highly recommend .<->1
Enjoyed my shawarma tremendously . Cocktail could have been better though . Think the food overall would be tasty for people being introduced to this type of food .<->1
I 've been going to this Roberto 's for about 3 years now and I have n't been disappointed once . I usually order a regular bean and cheese burrito or the Carne Asada Nachos but everything I 've tried is still good !<->1
Phenomenal . Great food . Flapper era photos and dim lights gave it a speak easy and roaring 20s feel . Ma Barker and I right at home . Good food . New staff dialing in but did well . Inside 0lanet Hollywood . Homerun<->1
The best price for the quality and definitely the quantity . The decor is dated . But who cares when you get a great meal at a great price .<->1
I love Estacion Inka ! You get a lot for your money and the food is delicious . Highly recommend !<->1
Fantastic food ! ! ! I got the vegetarian pho with tofu . Got there 5 minutes before closing and they still sat us ! Incredible food and incredible people .<->1
Still excellent ! Three of us got the mudslide cupcakes recently and wow just wow . The hoho cheesecake from the Food Network was awesome too .<->1
I have n't had anything here besides pastries , the once I 've tried were all yummy . Go for the french macaroons and Napoleon .<->1
The food is good , however definitely nothing special . It lacks seasoning for sure . The pricing I can say is ridiculous especially with so many other middle eastern places in the area .<->2
Soooo good ... the customer service was awesome , definitely will be back ! ! ! I never eat all of anything , and I do n't , but I almost ate all of my pizza . The pesto sauce , fresh garlic ... yummmmmnn<->1
Seriously best sushi intown ! ! I am obsessed with the double spicy roll with fresh jalapenos on top ! ! Always a great meal here !<->1
We like it ! We are here for the first time tonight and my wife and I both really liked the sandwiches we ordered . We live right by it . Took the sandwiches home and enjoyed them . Awesome work you guys !<->1
Very good steak and wine pairing ! But just know that it 's super expensive ( that 's why I have to give it a 4 Star for value ) .<->1
Super yummy , great toppings and yogurt combinations that offered several additional flavors .<->1
Read the reviews , and they were right . This place is outstanding . Great service and the spaghetti calzone was delicious .<->1
Was hungry and yelped this and I 'm glad I did ! ! First time here and I 'm coming back ! Ordered the vegetarian sandwich and sides of the Israeli couscous salad and " Seasonal " salad with ahi and watermelon soooo delicious ! !<->1
Excellent food , decor , service all with a great view . Best food we have had in Vegas period .<->1
The food is the bomb ! My husband and I come in here quite frequently . The staff is super friendly , the rib tips are great and I love the atmosphere . I am always referring people to this restaurant .<->1
Ein Besuch bei Köpke ist i m Sommer immer Pflicht ! Große , leckere Auswahl die zu einem gerechtfertigten Preis angeboten wird . Leider sind die Wartezeiten in den Hochzeiten recht lange , was aber durchaus nachvollziehbar ist .<->1
This place is awesome . Try the steak sandwich . You wo nt regret it . Great place for a quick lunch . The food is awesome and the service is quick and friendly .<->1
OK , I have forgotten about Starbucks forever . The employees here are the happiest people on earth , they have a stellar loyalty program , awesome drinks and reasonable prices . I now get the hype .<->1
This Subway is convenient when you are in a hurry . It gets five stars for being in an awesome location and for being open 24 hours a day , everyday .<->1
First time here , great options ! High quality meat . Love how staff lets you know all the ingredients to what they are serving . Clean , large tables unlike most Korean spots . Highly recommend !<->1
Fresh rolls are good . I 've had better pho elsewhere , however prices are cheap .<->2
good place , patio seating in the summer is awesome , food is ok not gray though , good selection of drinks .<->1
Loved it ! Our server was so nice even though her manager was super annoying :) The food was good , and we actually had a nice meal despite that it was 1:00 am<->1
The food was not very good . We had terrible service . We will not be coming back . Do not recommend olives & peppers .<->0
Likes : I like the way the buffet is organized into different types and ethnicities of food . Alaska king crab legs are a plus . Dislikes :<->1
I had the Chicken Teriyaki Bento Box delivered . Very clearly imitation crab in the California rolls . Quality of the chicken and tempura was subpar . The rest was just bland . Good customer service and presentation but food needs some work .<->0
One word - AMAZING ! ! So happy with this place , always fresh & consistent . And the customer service is phenomenal . Obsessed with this place , I definitely recommend !<->1
M Sushi has changed ownership and now have soon dubu and bibimbap ! I was informed by the new owner that the name will be changing in the upcoming months .<->1
First time at this location great service got my quirky order right and the food at this particular chain is amazing<->1
Both food and service are improved under new management ! So far the best AYCE in southwest area .<->1
You will be lucky if you do n't leave annoyed from here . The line seems to always take forever and customer service is always below average . The Sheetz near Walmart in North Huntingdon seems to be better . Avoid if you can !<->0
All I can say is amazing , totally blown away by not only how it 's made ( my grand daughter loved watching her ice cream come to life ) but the end result flavor . We will def be back<->1
Very good food , and perfect portion size . Definitely worth more visits in the near future .<->1
Best BBQ in Charlotte ! ! Wonderful customer service ! Love them ! Highly recommend ! ! The restaurant is always clean and welcoming and the staff are so friendly and helpful ! The food is Amazing ! You will love it !<->1
Very efficient staff and very clean lobby . No problems to report , very good experience ! Wish they were available in MN !<->1
Just stopped in with family . Beer selection and service were excellent as was the food . Really enjoyed the special sandwich and sweet potato fries .<->1
I really ca n't say that I was impressed with this place . May have to try it another day .<->0
Friendly and fast ! great service ! Every time I have been to this location the staff is always great . I would recommend this place to anyone traveling to the north shore !<->1
close to Linq ? busy street . recently opened ? pricing high but taste so so ? salmon is a little hard and pasta is salty ? we three ordered too much with no reminder ? 80bucks with tip worse than buffet<->0
Seeing a lot of the same reviews . Been sitting in drive thru pharmacy for about 20 min . Supposedly they 're " almost ready " to see me and have n't forgotten about me . Pretty horrible customer service .<->0
Great place for eggs Benedict and there banana cream pie is the best pie I have ever had . I really liked Mary calander pies before , but they just do n't compare . A must try .<->1
I always order Tom Yum Noodle . It has many ingredients and the soup is good . If you like spicy food , try medium for the spicy .<->1
This place is the BOMB ! Best bread in town . The Dilly Club and the clam chowder are my go to . It 's tucked away in a strip mall , but do n't eat that keep you away .<->1
Our favorite Mexican place in the Madison area . Great for large parties and kid friendly . They have a band play on weekends and the margaritas are delicious !<->1
Fun little coffee shop ! ! Later hours would better for students who want to study later in the day .<->1
Love going to the vitamin shoppe ! ! ! The staff is always very welcoming , friendly , and knowledgeable .<->1
Worst experience I ever had , in terms of service it was not up to the mark . I also did n't like food taste wise .<->0
Stopped in for a quick lunch on a Saturday . The place was packed , but service was great . Food was super . We will be back .<->1
Just tried the restaurant . I love the environment there . People are really sweet and nice . The rice meal and desserts are my love even I do not like sweet food .<->1
The pork belly taco and nachos and delicious , as well as churros . Nice twist to authentic tacos . Only drawback was the carnitas taco tasted like there was some cinnamon in it , not sure if I liked that .<->1
Food was good , I was very impressed with the decor - clean , modern . not kid friendly and our waitress was completely clueless .<->1
Great food .. prices a bit high but nothing crazy .. service is awesome .. chicken karahi is my go to dish<->1
Sushi was pretty mediocre . Service was not good . Our waitress full on sat down at another customers table and had a 20 minute conversation with them ignoring us .<->0
Looked for good Salmon Lox and found it here ! ! There 's so much more to offer on the menu great for breakfast and lunch ! Will definitely be back ! YouTube.com / jencabardo<->1
Great Chicago style BBQ in AZ .. The pulled pork is a must ... And say yes to their spicy sauce ... It truly is just like Chicago ...<->1
Expensive . Chunks of meat hard to chew . Would 've been nice if meat was sliced instead . Not enough takasi sauce . Best part was pita and hummus . Do n't think I 'll return .<->0
Amazing BBQ at a good price for the quality of food . Drinks were well priced and very good . Wait staff was kind and prompt and did a great job overall .<->1
Go for the Pho and OMG soups . Amazing portion sizes filled with noodles , veg . and protein of your choice . Super fast service too<->1
Was n't the best food or service ever . Both meals were very bland . The house salad looked like it was out of a bag . The Marsala was wet and lacked any depth . The baked penne was also very boring .<->0
The egg flower soup was delicious , but the rest of the meal was fairly bland . Service was very friendly . Would have liked to see the whole menu other than just the lunch combos .<->2
The broth is the best part ! Everything was perfectly cool and balanced . Will be returning soon .<->1
This Zipps seems more welcoming and open than the one in Old Town . The bar staff has always been much nicer and more attentive than other locations . The bar food came out fast and was acceptable .<->1
Food taste really good and the price is super ! The gentle man owner was pleasant to talk to . I will definitely come back .<->1
Good deal on the Oysters , nice rolls . Nothing to write home about , but as Sushi bars go it was A - Ok . Probably the nicest Sushi Bar in the Avondale area .<->2
If your ever in Tempe Az this is a must . Cash only but awesome little hole in the wall restaurant .<->1
I 'm writing this review strictly for the coconut bread pudding . The food was nothing special , I 'd compare it to chevys honestly . But that fried ice cream and coconut bread pudding is killer ! Good service overall<->2
The food here is decent . It 's not bad at all but it 's also not amazing . It 's a good go - to place if you want something quick and cheap . For the prices they offer , the portions are pretty big .<->2
So . Good . Took my family from out of town here and we are all so full and satisfied . Kevin , the owner , is superb . Definitely will bring more family and friends here next time . Pictures included :) !<->1
This place is really cool and has some of the best beer you can find . I usually come in for a couple and take home a couple growlers . They do n't last long I should probably start taking home more .<->1
Very good south Indian food . Service is OK . Have been there for Dinner and food has been consistantly good .<->1
This is mine and my wife 's favorite seafood place . Very clean great menu , food taste great . if you visit try the steamed bucket w / lobster and crab legs delicious .<->1
Just visited this place . Nice big store with decent prices and selection . Will go again<->1
Basic wine tasting room but nice ambiance and wine . I really like the zinfandel . Very close to fountain .<->1
I love it Best places to eat . Services friendly . Thank you for Mr Chow . I love waitress her name Carley . She 's best service person<->1
We had been wanting to come by to try the legendary Orange Juice ! ! ! It was simple yet tasty and definitely worth a try ! Lineup was long but the service is fast so the wait was n't that long .<->1
Cozy place for grabbing a bite , a coffee , and working on your laptop . The outdoor terrasse is a haven . Their restrooms are clean , and the water jar next to the counter is a nice touch .<->1
Good burgers and even better milkshakes dangerously delicious shakes ! The lettuce bun could be more lettuce and they should use romaine lettuce instead not iceberg lettuce !<->1
We order delivery from here often . Our food always arrives on time and hot . Our favorites include the garlic Parmesan breaded wings and the cheese pizza . We have always received good food and good service !<->1
Aaron and Kenny are great at the bar and our server Leah was fantastic . Would recommend anyone that comes to Cleveland to visit .<->1
Great $ 2 taco Tuesday ! Meal was cooked just right ! The staff was friendly and aware of our needs . Clean environment ! Would recommend this place to others !<->1
This was a great place ! So many options ! Seriously ! Come here ! ! ! If you like sushi , try it ! ! ! The staff is so nice ! ! !<->1
Cute little 24 hour spot .. Love that they have a lot of teas to choose from . And the sizes were big it 's great ! Will definitely be back ! Thank you<->1
Quiet , little neighborhood spot . Food was great and portion sizes were large . I like the family owned atmosphere . Will definitely go back , i really want to try a pizza next time .<->1
great place for coffee and work :) The soup and sandwiches are tasty too . It 's too bad the hours are not longer ! I love the atmosphere , it 's great to come here and just chill with a friend .<->1
Excellent burgers . Blows 5 guys out of the water . This was our first time here , but not the last . Service was good too .<->1
The wing are pretty good . The lemon pepper i think was the best . It bit on the pricer side but well worth it .<->1
$ 14 for lunch + $ 2 drinks for mediocre selections and bland food . Not really worth the price for the quality of food .<->0
Un endroit qu'on gagne à découvrir . Ils ont changé d'administration et la nourriture est excellente à très bon prix . Pour mes diner d'affaire c'est un très bon endroit .<->1
They have some decent vegetarian options . You can get veggies & tofu as your protein choice . Plus the iced tea is great . I love that they have 2 different serving size options too .<->1
Pretty good gyro . Try the original gyro if unsure what to get . Everything has been good . Best price for gyro type food . Call and order since there seems to always be a line .<->1
This place is really consistent with their sushi and sashimi . It 's not the best but the cocktails , presentation , and ambiance make up for it .<->1
This place is good but nor great . The portions are large , ribs and tri tip are perhaps my top choices - oh and the biscuit and apple butter is tasty but not enough to give 4 stars .<->2
Worst service ever ! ! ! Took forever to get wings and it was n't even crowded . Wo n't ever go back !<->0
Portion size was good but Kalua pork was very dry . Keoki brand Lau Lau is always good .<->2
Been to Thailand many times and I can say , this place is the real deal ! Service and food both !<->1
Brisam 's is a great place for lunch . Whenever I 'm craving the best Philly cheese steak sandwich in town this is where you will find me . I always order my Philly cheese steak with chopped jalapeños and a side of fries .<->1
Wonderful staff and delicious food . I usually get a steak with fries and a salad with Thousand Island dressing . it is always cooked perfectly and delicious .<->1
I definitely believe this is the best boba tea cafe in Vegas . Much better than Brew or Kung Fu hands down<->1
Fresh tortillas make the great tacos outstanding I 've been twice and I have n't tried anything but the tacos they are that good maybe one day I 'll try something else<->1
Great food and friendly staff ! I had the Sun Devil Zone and it was tasty ! There are lots of different options and I would definitely come back .<->1
Not authentic but has a great variety and is pretty good . Seating is limited and lunch rush is busy . Parking is kind of messy as well .<->2
The one in Scottsdale Next to mall have always great music , staff superfriendly ! I just think is little expensive if not I will be always here ! ! My favorite nutella ! !<->1
Amazing fish tacos . I went to Coconut 's in Maui many years ago and fell in love . I am so thrilled that Coconut 's came to Scottsdale ! Always consistently delicious !<->1
Not impressed . Staff is oblivious to customer needs . Food is overpriced and bland . I will only return to shop in their store but will dine elsewhere .<->0
This place needs to be featured on an episode of Bar Rescue . Beyond terrible service .<->0
Everything was fresh ... lots of variety - - buffet , sushi and hibachi . Will definitely be back !<->1
Food was not good at all . For the price I 'd rather eat at other buffets . Should have known when there was no line to get in .<->0
Love ! Love ! Love this place ! But what 's with all the tattoos and facial piercings on the people behind the cash registers ? It appears as a requirement , if you want to work there . Not very professional .<->1
Love Firehouse Subs , switched things up and tried the Turkey Bacon Ranch , it was amazing !<->1
Best place to listen to J - Pop in Scottsdale .<->1
Great place to grab organic food in Phoenix . I loved the salads , and people behind the counter were friendly . It would have been a 5 star if food came out a bit quicker .<->1
I am not a fan of this store . the main reason is the hygiene concerns . I do n't know why many people like it .<->0
It 's one of my favourite places in the city . Great food great music great staff ( always so accommodating ) . They ll recognize you and know if you frequent the bar . I love this place always well taken care of here .<->1
Who does n't love lemon custard ? So refreshing ! And really great in a lemon chiffon snowstorm . The only negative is the long lines - but still worth it !<->1
So many flavors , so hard to chose a favorite . From standards to specialty flavors they 're all delicious . The blueberry lavender is amazing .<->1
Poor service . Always slow . Even ordering with online does n't help . Went to Wendy 's down the street instead .<->0
The best Fish ( Halibut ) & Chips I ve ever had . I also love their light choices , blackend salmon with ceasar salad .<->1
Great place ! Basically a local version of Panera . Tasty :-)<->1
So delicious and healthy . I love the chicken bowl with brown rice ... yum !<->1
Best restaurant ever ! Never had a bad dish and the staff is great . I 've been coming here for over 20 years and it still remains one of my favorites . I recommend everything !<->1
Mellow vibe well poured Guinness like nyc pricing but nicely done interior snd cordial service<->1
Really liked there combo . This restaurant was hard to find good luck finding it but , if u find place u wo n't b disappointed .<->1
Good place to get a nice smoothie during a very hot day and hang around with family & friends .<->1
It was not bad , but there are too many new ramen places better than Kinton . North York one is better .<->2
We really enjoyed this place . Great frozen / blended coffee , and fantastic crepe . We had the peach one , and would almost lick the plate . Ca n't wait to try a savory one , they look great too<->1
Pork belly baos = d elicious Duck rice = tasty Short rib grilled cheese = best grilled cheese ever ! ! ! Definitely a must . Although , I wish they had a better dessert menu . "<->1
Great place , great food , great service . My only suggestion would be to enhance the menu a little otherwise , great food . Cold beer on tap , modern decor . Another great place to enjoy happy hour or dinner .<->1
I like their queen creek location better as far as space , set up and friendlier staff but the food was delicious . I recommend the pollo fundito<->2
I thought this was a seafood restaurant . I was wrong . The steak was one of the best that I can remember . The appetizers were fantastic . The halloumi cheese was really wonderful . I ca n't wait to go back again !<->1
It 's worth the hype . Trust me . I tried the Fontina burger , I believe , featured in that TV show . It was quite tasty . My girlfriend had the chicken strips , also tasty . Their strawberry lemonade is amazing . The bathrooms are interesting , check them out .<->1
I had half a hawg and oh my gosh ... these were the best ribs i 've ever eaten . The ribs have a smoky sweet flavor , loved the fries ! ! ! I ca n't wait to come back<->1
I 'm in town for business and ordered delivery to my hotel ! Pizza arrived quick , hot and tasty ! ! ! I 'm glad I chose Pizza Parma ! ! The crust was nice and buttery ! !<->1
What a clean restaurant with great service and great food . The Caesar salad was deliciously simple and presented well . Not overly dressed . The soprasetta pizza was scrumptious too . A delicious sauce . Every bite was tasty . Thank You !<->1
New location Rocks . It 's very nice and new . Nice move ! Had # 5 great tasting . Fair prices . Go before the snowbirds get back .<->1
The selection is n't great , but the quality is great . I had the mascarpone cake and it was delicious . Light , fluffy . I finished the whole thing . Great little place . Must try more .<->1
Do n't bother . Poor execution and few items in the menu . For the same price you can easily find better all you can eat in downtown . Friendly staff .<->0
Cheeseburgers - great , though over - priced . Fries - plenty of them , but they are cold , greasy and limp . Blehh ...<->2
Discovered this new place . Had the Nuts & Honey made out Greek Yogurt and pink Grapefruit Sorbet . Just wow !<->1
Two of my best friends brought me here for my bday . It was one of my favorite meals ! Need to come back and try their brunch selections .<->1
Service was top notch , music was great , sushi was even better . Definitely coming back again .<->1
Ca n't even give one star . Lousy service . Had to leave after waiting 30 minutes for a simple breakfast .<->0
The food was excellent and reasonably priced . The service was great . The atmosphere , relaxing . So nice to get a great value for your money ! I will be back !<->1
Amazing ! staff is always helpful and organized . They are very knowledgeable about the products .<->1
Best brunch I had in Arizona hands down . Amazing food ( the honey bruschetta - - ca nt remember the name , is amazing ) and the bottomless drinks are to die for . Good ambiance too !<->1
Love love love the food ... best i ve had except my husbands ... love the ideas and thought put into their menu !<->1
Is very good , l'll come back again . The goid was AMAZING and the waitresses all were cheerfull .<->1
I really like the type of food that is served here . Mostly Mediterranean dishes which is my favorite cuisine . The only negative is that this place can get annoyingly crowded sometimes .<->1
It 's at a convenient location from where I live . Great people , great food , great service but not very clean . It 's almost as dirty as Jane and Wilson location .<->2
Perfect place to get most of the items I need to stay on track for my weight loss . They have a great selection of no fat no sugar salad dressing that actually tastes great .<->1
Great food Awesome service . plus free fried icecream with check in !<->1
We absolutely love the food here and that it has variety of options of crepes , smoothies , etc . The atmosphere is great for nearly almost all occasions and the service is wonderful ! !<->1
This place is such a hidden gem . We have been multiple times and are never disappointed . Try the nero chocolate with raspberry or stracciatella .<->1
i would return just for drinks , the atmosphere is very nice trendy , and bar selection great - However menu selection not the best<->2
Bad fucking service . Sat for 20 min and no drinks were served . Ruined my fiancée birthday dinner . Waited all day for us to walk out unhappy . Bad bad service . Do n't go . Rude ass people .<->0
Food was just plain , not of a lot of variety either . Not a place I 'd be eager to come back too .<->2
Sat down to eat at 7:30 did n't get our food till 9:30 and the food was n't even that great<->0
The tom Ka was AMAzing . Get the forbidden fried rice . Thai martini . I 'm really happy about how wonderful it is in person . First time to dine in and wayyyy better than take out . Yea . Great solo experience .<->1
Great location of the B Boyz chain . Service is quick and prices are good . I alwaysbget the veggie meat burrito . Really nice to have that option . Everything taste fresh and it 's a regular place for me to visit .<->1
Soooooooo good . Very clean inside and very polite . They 're food is just simply incredible !<->1
Solid arepas at an above - average price , but since it 's Vegas it probably gets another star .<->1
Great beer . Great atmosphere . Great burgers . Great breakfast . Order my burger cooked medium and they ACTUALLY cooked it medium !<->1
My 2nd Favourite Chinese Restaurant in Town . Be sure to eat outdoors on their patio . They have a nice outdoor fountain as well .<->1
Had a GREAT time sunday watching the game ! great atmosphere great service ! ! ! Ask for Tiffany if you go she was terrific ! ! !<->1
Love going here . It 's affordable with a great atmosphere and fantastic food ! Would go everyday if I could !<->1
Great local find ! ! ! Family owned business with quality food and ingredients . They make their own aguas frescas and ice cream too ! You can not go wrong with anything you order here ! ! !<->1
Endroit adorable et sympathique , superbe staff , mais café moyen .<->2
I love arabica ! Always have ! Their iced mochas are the best ! This location always is quick and friendly . The cookies are huge and amazinggg ! I love their muffins ! A great little convenient spot in Chesterland !<->1
Walked in for the first time they got The Roots playing . Ordered a huge and tasty chocolate chip cookie with a cappuccino . All good ! Cool spot ! ! Could use a few more seats .<->1
Slow and screwing up orders . Never should have added the second drive - thru . They are stupid and a waste of money .<->0
Great service ! But the food was SUPURB ! Everything was fresh , hot and fast . Will be a go to place .<->1
Best breakfast around . Fast , friendly service with a smile - these girls hustle ! Food and portion sizes are good , and you 'll never see the bottom of your coffee cup !<->1
Great salad , fast service and respectable pizza . The bar setting makes this a welcoming hangout .<->1
SO Good ! I got the fresh and meaty meal for $ 7 huge portion of fries , burger was amazing . Will def . make this a regular place !<->1
I did n't realize chorizo was supposed to be served burnt . It 's happened to us twice at this location now . So disappointing .<->0
Wow ! ! ! This place is absolutely incredible ! Healthy eats for an affordable price and excellent service . Try the buffalo chicken wrap as well as the orange ginger lyfe water ... Dummy fire ! ! !<->1
Most authentic Mexican food the west side has to offer . Reasonable price , great taste , and friendly / family service . I have been a loyal customer for 15 years . Simple surroundings , great food .<->1
Best wings I 've had in Phoenix ! I tried it for the first time today and loved it ! ! AWESOME customer service and great atmosphere !<->1
Superb . Had a very nice filet , cooked as I had asked ( medium - well ) and a very nice port to finish . It ' s not an inexpensive place , but well worth the money in my opinion .<->1
The Chicago deap dish pizza and meatball sandwich were above and beyond the ordinary .. Well worth it no doubt .<->2
Love the outdoor patio ! Their food is consistently good and it 's a great place for a group . I had the lamb shish and loved it .<->1
The food is not terrible , but the uneven service and tiny portions make this place very underwhelming . Finally , agree with earlier yelper that the wine list by the glass is tremendously overpriced .<->0
Food is great . Too bad the restaurant does n't seat comfortably and wait tines are often long .<->2
Great food and service ! We had the Hells Kitchen and Chanterelle burgers and shared a Just Fries . Excellent flavors ! Topped off with Guinness on draft ! Highly recommend for lunch .<->1
A little diff to find because it s upstairs . Just park and walk . Very large restaurant . Good ambience . Quick helpful waiter .<->1
I came here on a hot day and I was sweating throughout the meal . The AC was weak .. It was so hot that I could n't really taste my food to give a rating .<->0
The cupcake tasted fine . Kinda fell apart and was to sugary and fake ingredient tasting . Also small . Customer service was great . Place itself it super cute and fun .<->0
my favorite place to visit for a nice lunch , and my favorite place for a casual date . good food for a good price and a great atmosphere . worth it . the macaroni salad is to die for<->1
Decent food . Lots of regulars in the dining area . Seemed like a very relaxed dining experience but I would n't return since did n't wow me .<->2
Allez , une étoile en plus pour un meilleur café et un employé / proprio ? trop gentil . Déjà mieux que la dernière fois !<->2
What is all the hype about ? ? The burgers are greasy and fries not that great . Sorry In n Out only 2 stars from me .<->0
Cafe Rio is a clean restaurant that has a meal for around $ 8 . The sweet pulled pork is SO good ! I 've had the burritos & taco salad . They 're so good I have those two things all the time .<->1
Big guys pizza just keeps getting better and better . Been coming here for years as a south hills local and love this spot . So many creative pizza and Hoagie options to choose from . Highly recommend it .<->1
Great food . I have been there twice and the service was lacking . Tables ignored . Consider this a takeout spot until they train someone new .<->0
I normally do n't write reviews , but let me tell you I ordered the BBQ bacon burger and it was amazing ! My husband got the beast then ordered one to go . Amazing ! Ps you have to try the onion rings .<->1
I come down to mill all the time but this was the first time i stumbled into Munchies . The service was excellent . The food was okay , but I did n't order much . Its a definite must if you are down there .<->1
Great cone for a dollar no kidding Tasty shakes as well . Fun music and casual atmosphere . Great deal !<->1
My vegetarian daughter loves the foccacia pizza with just all veggies . The wings taste really fresh . Definitely will eat there again .<->1
Great environment & atmosphere . Excellent customer service and the food is delicious ! ! I 've been to the Honolulu location and I 'm pretty amazed that they have several locations in Vegas .<->1
The food is great and the service is like no other . They are constantly checking on you to make sure everything is okay . This is my new favorite deli . I love this place .<->1
The 50 ' s diner decor is a little weird , but the service is good and the food is a good value and tasty .<->2
Great service . Had the flip side eggs Benedict and it was very tasty and the perfect portion . It was n't too salty or heavy either . Waffle and fried chicken were n't greasy either . Only thing missing was a mimosa :)<->1
Consistently excellent food , always spectacular service . In my humble opinion , one of the best restaurants in Pittsburgh hands down .<->1
The service was fine , but the food was mediocre at best . Also , the overwhelming and unpleasant smell that hit me when I walked in sort of set a bad mark from the start of lunch . Overall it 's just ... meh .<->0
Bad ass sandwiches best sandwiches I 've ever had ... anyone that says this is not a five star sub restaurant is out of their mind ... , the bomb is exactly what it says the bomb ... Excellent service and even more excellent food<->1
I ordered the comeback burger & was exceptionally pleased . Very delicious and fresh ! ! If you are in little burgundy , this is the best place to take your friends .<->1
The 4.5 star rating is well deserved . The food and service were excellent . The apricot butter naan was especially delicious .<->1
ExquisiteFine wine and tasty appetizers Great place for evening get together with friends or a table for two with a special someone ! Highly recommended for people who enjoy the finer things in life .<->1
Yes it 's in a gas station but it 's really good food and a really low price $ 2 for seasoned french fries really good price and really good tasting .<->1
My favourite club / pub / patio / whatever in Toronto so far . Really enjoyed the food and the dance floor :)<->1
I 'm only writing this review to tell everyone to order the spicy coconut lobster soup and Thai iced tea . I just came here for a quick bite , so I ca n't speak to the rest of the menu , but try these !<->1
A great place for pizza and beer . Good happy hour prices . A nice place to watch the game .<->1
Clam chowder , gumbo , crystal gulf fried shrimp , & coconut curry mussels are a must for happy hour ! All drinks were great too . Do not recommend the alligator meatballs .<->1
Nothing really that makes it a Mexican bar ... ? Wings are good . Anything else is freezer burned and microwaved . Cheap booze . Attracting the dormonster crowd<->0
Disgusting inside . Usually a solid experience , but was deeply disappointed ... short - staffed and behind schedule which meant the theater did n't get cleaned between movies .<->0
This spec clean hot oven bakery at Royal York .. Is very , very good ! ! The best part is the impeccable service . only flaw is some missing var.iety in desserts ? ? great atmosphere and HAS wifi .<->1
Grabbed a apple - lychee soda and pork belly buns ... died and went to heaven ! ! ! I 'll be back ! Thus place was wonderful ! ! !<->1
Best lemon bars EVER . The bakery recently made cupcakes for my daughters birthday and they were a hit : moist and light with sweet and fluffy frosting . Everyone at the party was asking about them . One of my current local faves !<->1
My new sushi spot in Vegas . Been to many spots for sushi and this place is legit . Highly recommended<->1
I Loved this place . Great seafood , great appetizers , good wine . I highly recommend the Calamari platter , and the potatoe<->1
Probably the worst quesadilla i have ever had . Not very big and served on small corn tortillas . And , it was also super expensive . This place is not worth your time .<->0
Great food ! We had the Poutine and Spam slides for appetizers and beer . Cool vibes and great local selection .<->1
The food here is great and the staff is amazing . The restaurant can be a bit crowded at lunch time but it 's also worth the wait .<->1
This is a very nice place . The food was wonderful and the service was too ! I highly recommend it ! We did the English Tea and it was great !<->1
Service was very slow and bordered on surly . Plenty of other options in Vegas - take them .<->0
We 've shopped here for many years in the past but rarely anymore , they are getting too expensive compared to other Japanese / Korean markets in Vegas . Curious how they could stay in business .<->0
Food and atmosphere was very good , Kaj the manager made us feel very welcome and my wife and I will definitely be coming back !<->1
Not only was the Sushi amazing the service was too ... we had a great time here today ! Saki bombs ... Vegas Rolls ... Salmon Sushimi ... everything was 5 star ... we will be back ! !<->1
Vintage ambiance , good food and great service ( the waiters are actually so friendly here ) . Went for summerlicious . Quite an interesting menu .<->2
Brunch ends strictly at 2 pm , so do n't expect to get a menu at 130 & be served . Hostess will be rude about seating you as well . Go down the street to local .<->0
Wow , what a treat ! the fish and rolls were tasty and fresh and staff and owner is super nice . This place is run by actual Japanese sushi chef . Very authentic . Found my new favorite AYCE sushi place . YUM !<->1
Great customer service by older gentleman . He took time to explain the the special of month . He was training a young lady and was very patient and kind . Recommend .<->1
I had breakfast at this restaurant today based on location & the reviews from yelp . The food was very good , it was great value for the money spent . I really liked the coffee & highly recommend this place for breakfast !<->1
Not always easy to get a table but we 'll worth the wait . Everything I 've ever eaten has been phenomenal . After having a tipsy cow burger , All other burgers pale in comparison . The beer selection is great too !<->1
So many times I 've gotten free coffee here , I always come back and spend more money just to support this sweet cafe .<->1
Been here three times now and will continue to come back . Everything I ve tried so far has been really good . " The devil burger is hands down one of the best burgers I 've ever had ! "<->1
Loved the Wisconsin salad . Great pizza on thin crust . 3 stars bc there is no recycling and they use paper plates for every slice . Good staffers<->2
This is pretty much the only bar i go to . Small but drinks are good its an everyone knows your name kinda bar . Its pretty much locals . Good people .<->1
We came here for our wedding anniversary and everything was absolutely breathtaking ! From the food , to the view , and the service , there is no other place like this , we will definitely be back !<->1
Long wait and good food . I would go back . The menu was very interesting and not just traditional breakfast fare .<->1
The Rosh Lamb and the Tikki Masala were fantastic . The garlic naan as well . Will be back !<->1
I ca n't recommend this place enough . Great coffee , interesting drinks , and really friendly service . Plus , they have more Torani syrups than I have ever seen in any coffee establishment ever ! WiFi seemed reliable , and plenty of outlets . Check it out .<->1
I 'm get my breakfast to - go here about 2 times a week . The omelettes are fantastic , and they fill you up for hours . I 'd recommend this place for sure , just beware , the lines are long for a reason so plan a head .<->1
Hard to get in on weekends during prime time hours without a reservation . One of my favorite places at Caesars .<->1
The food comes out really fast . Beef was tender and tasteful . The rice noodles I ordered was really chewy This portion was great and the price was reasonable ! Nice place to take a quick lunch and dinner<->1
Stopped by during a brief trip to the area . The food here was very heavy of lard , or whatever they use to cook everything in . Made me slightly ill from sitting in my tummy undigested . Blah . I 'll pass next time .<->0
Been here twice . I really enjoy the food . Brought my kids here on the second visit and they really enjoyed their udon noodles . Service is friendly and prompt .<->1
Been here now 6 + times and have tried many burgers . Love the burgers , love the steamed buns and love the adult milkshakes . They combined with the Ramen place next door , which is nice as well .<->1
Great clean environment , nice drinks I happen to love their thai tea and tuna crossaint sandwiches . The sandwich was huge with crisp pickles , lettuce , tomato and swiss cheese . The thai tea was extra cold and creamy .<->1
Love this place ! A new discovery we went recently and they inadvertently put bacon on my salad but quickly rectified it and we even tried the creme brûlée cheesecake yum ! Definitely will go back !<->1
Great food , surprisingly fair prices , great service . Go now . Drop what you 're doing and just go now . NOW ! ( better bring cash though )<->1
Bartenders hate their jobs here at hickory tavern . I suggest if you 're out having a good time and in search for a drink you skip this joint .<->0
I ordered the western sandwich it was very good . The last time I went I ordered the eggs with corned beef hash ... it was tasty .<->2
Excellent food . Kind of off the beaten path . You can get there by taking light rail and walking about 9 min . It 's all worth it .<->1
Kayla was very friendly ! Great service , almost asks if everything was okay . Offered water . Kayla is the new owner of Nail Bar ! 5 stars<->1
Great food , great service . I was embarrassed for the city that we were the only ones in the place . This was the best Thai food I have had in years !<->1
Best sandwiches . also the kool - aid ... and friendliest service around ! ! ! I love the Kali Mist sandwich , and the pretzel nuggets with honey mustard are to die for .<->1
Their salad bar is the best ... And the pasta tasty !<->1
The manager of this store must have changed recently . I find that they never have enough cashiers ... while i get that is a typical Walmart thing , this store seems to be getting worse as time goes on .<->0
Always great service . The food is also good and well prepared . Prices are very reasonable too . I have been here many times with my wife . Chicken or beef enchiladas and flan for desert .<->1
Love this place ! Great pizza , wings and LOVE the garlic knots . The owner and employees are fantastic and super sweet .<->1
Damn good . Order the green or the red curry . The Sesame chicken was a hit and so was the Szechwan beef . Solid pick .<->1
5 stars for the tacos ! It 's ambiance meh , but you 'll be staring at your food so who cares !<->1
Very good food and even better service . Such nice people running the place . Will definitely be back .<->1
I love this restaurant it reminds me of one you will find in Chinatown with all authentic items on the menu .<->1
L accueil était effroyable l endroit était sale lA éviter<->0
Great dark roast coffee and breakfast sandwiches after my morning bike riding workout !<->1
Our go to pizza place . Love all the different pizza flavors as well as the salads . Service is usually pretty decent as wel<->1
This place is quite pricy but the servings are big . The menu is really big too ! A lot of choices from American to Asian .<->1
they forgot my avocado ! I clearly said I wanted some but they forgot and never PUT SOME . SMH I WAS LOOKING FORWARD TO MY FOOD !<->0
Was just ok could be better<->2
After eating here , I developed worst case of food poisoning that I can recall in my life . I doubt that I will ever return .<->0
This is a great place to get amazing sausages , smokies , pâté and ham . Another Old Brooklyn gem .<->1
Great restaurant . The food is good and the staff is friendly . The place is very clean and the pie is good . I like the Hamburgers as they are good and they have good fries as well .<->1
Great one man bbq . I had the pulled pork and spicy sausage sandwich . Great sauce and sides too . A fair price at 9.00<->1
Poor service , terrible food , overpriced . Why bother ?<->0
Great hole in the wall . Fast and friendly hard to find . But definitely worth try for breakfast<->1
Wow big size plates ... Very tasty food with actual flavor .. I had the basil chicken .. my other members in my family had the deep fried salmon .. and the steak ... mmmmmm good baby ..<->1
Expensive ! The pasta is not handmade , and the quality of food was not good at all .. Very Disappointed .. the antipasto and garlic bread are good ! !<->0
Wow ! Came due to high reviews . Do n't let outside appearance deter you ! These are the best wings I have had in Charlotte . The woman working the register was also very nice .<->1
you guys the french fries are life . ball is not life . in n out burger fries are life . i fucking love your fries . if i get fat it ll be off your fries i love you guys .<->1
The nagasaki milk tea is hands down one of the best milk teas I 've ever had . It 's not too sweet , yet full of milk tea flavor . Must try if you visit !<->1
Open area , really impressive cocktail menu , food is delicious . Beers and chilled wine for the patio . Live music and daily specials . Great new bar in the Kent area .<->1
The food is always consistent , have n't had a bad meal . The chocolate chips cookies are soooo yummy ! The staffs are very friendly .<->1
Great food ( try the specialty pizzas ) , great and quick service . My favorite neighborhood pizza place .<->1
The employees were very nice . I had the Chechen satay , wonton soup and the Thai basil chicken . The food was delicious .<->1
I wanted to like this place . The atmosphere is bright and busy . Came here Sunday around 12 noon . Waited an hour to get a table . Ended up full but my taste buds were craving for more .<->2
Bacado omelet was just ok . Service was certainly not the best . Had to flag down my waitress for hot coffee to many times .<->0
Awesome atmosphere ! ! ! ... great food ! ! ! .. very good noodles and pho ! ! ... great service and great menu ! ! ... very flavorful ! ! ... you should check it out and eat ! !<->1
Amazing staff amazing food always served fresh and with a smile . Makes my day every time I stop in . Keep up the great work , all businesses at the West Side Market should be this great !<->1
Gyros are great hot wing have way too much sauce and it is runny more like soup . To messy to eat<->1
One of the highest volume Chicks in the known universe , they move like a well - oiled machine . Not even the Stonecrest parking lot designed by M . C . Escher can put a dent in their ops .<->1
i love this place best late night drunk food and cheap been going to this joint for more than 10 years best hot tea in town , first choice for me hands down<->1
My family and I go here fairly often . I would recommend getting their Malay curry or their laksa . Not a bad place overall .<->2
Went to Steak and Shake last week . The hamburgers , fries and chili were as good as I remembered some 40 years ago . Did n't have to salt or pepper anything . Wish they 'd expand in the East Valley .<->1
Worst shit ever combining the price and shitty ass food , fuck this place , fuuuuuuuuuuuuuuuuuuuuuuuuuuuuuuuuuuuuuuuuuuuuuuuuuuk<->0
If you like good healthy food on a budget , look no further . This place really taps my toe on every level .<->1
The food was okay but the service was terrible . We waited two hours for our meal and some of the children were served last to be served . Some of our favorite meals were discontinued from the menu .<->0
My family and I love this place . Good deal on breakfast and awesome fish and chips with a big onion ring on top .<->1
First time here ? All you need to know is the folllowing : 1 . Spicy salmon sashimi 2 . East end maki roll with soft shell crab 3 . Gyoza 4 . CheesecakeEnjoy , and have a wonderful time .<->1
So early in the afternoon and out of snacks already so if you 're there just for coffee who knows we did n't stay to try it<->2
Excellent food and service . I would recommend it to a friend in a heart beat . Momos are are one of the best I 've had and chilli fries are scrumptious . 5 Stars !<->1
Love the curry recipes , the pad Thai was a tad too sweet . The lemongrass tea was very nice .<->1
Main security line was long . Airport staff informed folks of a second security checkpoint that had almost no wait . This was very helpful . Airport not crowded . Sufficient charging stations . Overall good experience .<->1
Love their Tapa 's bogo special ( chix skewers , yum ) and enjoy eating outside on their patio is great ! Service is good and staff is personable .<->2
Changed ownership , give it a shot ! Would have to say that the customer service has improved drastically and the food is on par with other Vietnamese restaurants in south Calgary .<->2
This is by far the best pizza I 've had . I love the atmosphere and the customer service is outstanding ! My go to place in AZ ! !<->1
Cheap drinks , cheap food . Good music seems to always be playing . Cool vibes . I recommend it .<->1
Worst ihop in the line of ihops . Bathroom was disgusting . Hoodlums hang out front ... Pretty sure a drug deal went down with a chef . Bugs on the table , big ones , with 6 legs . Never going back<->0
Good place in downtown for Dim Sum . Overall pretty standard experience , nothing to complain about .<->1
Even though this is a McDonald 's and already held to an extremely low standard . This one is pretty terrible . The food always seems to be cold and the service sucks .<->0
This place is amazing ! The owners are so nice and explain everything if you tell them it 's your first time . I got the taro tea slush with crystal boba ! Delicious . Definitely recommend<->1
Best falafel I 've had in Pittsburgh . Right on Murray Ave near Jerry 's records and Dobra tea . Very friendly wait staff that seem to be getting better and faster . Check out their YELP checkin special for a free soda .<->1
Great service and atmosphere . Has games to play with much like boba places ! ! ! Must stop by ! ! !<->1
Service was great everyone was nice .. I had fried chicken sand which vehicles was a bit tough to bite into . Other the that no complaints food was hot when it came out .<->1
Good service , food , variety & prices . Do not miss this place<->1
The best sandwich shop I 've ever been to . Highly recommend the Julius Caesar , on their signature bread . Just tremendous .<->1
The food here is great , custom drinks are really good and the service ( Bethany ) is pretty amazing ! There was a hiccup with the computer system but they took care of us accordingly ! Will be back .<->1
Best Mexican food in all of Vegas in my opinion ! ! The service is impeccable and the experience is completely authentic . AMAZING ! ! I 've been coming here for years now ! ! Thank you all ! !<->1
Food was great , service was okay . Veggie burger was amazing as well as the atomic fries . Took about 10 minutes to be seated and about 15 for the food . Love this place . Would definitely go back .<->1
This place was quick but delicious . Great for on the go sushi and the kids can enjoy cooked food .<->1
Always a pleasure eating at O - Ku . The food is above par and the sushi is some of the best in Charlotte in my opinion . The Truffle Oil Edamame is delicious !<->1
I 've been here twice now for a quick lunch . Both times the place was pretty quiet ( it was a weekday ) and the service was great and the food was delicious . Edit : spelling<->1
Awesome staff ! ! Bartenders off the charts ! Had the smoked wings that make you drool ! Great location ! Special shout out to j - money ! Love you guys ! Thanks so much Cadillac Eddie 's for my drinkable Mexican rice ! Delicious ! !<->1
Hearing my wife vomit all night is NOT A PLEASANT evening . She had the swiss steak " special " Sunday night before closing ... Maybe it had been out for a few days . I 'm calling county health department to report this .<->0
Lovely brunch ! More than expectation ! The only drawback is the ugly font on menu !<->1
They give you good portions of delicious Mexican food and good prices . Only bad part is there are only 2 tables and they are in constant use and never seem to be clean .<->1
Excellent food and service - - a rare combination these days . The staff was courteous and the food arrived on time . Strongly recommend you try it !<->1
+ Their smoothies are DELICIOUS ! I love the green smoothie ( kale , avocado , yogurt ) - Rice bowls are OK ... the noodle bowls are a horrible , clumpy mess .<->2
The frozen custard has over 69 years of history of family owned business . My family has lived near and visited for over 50 years . So tasty love it ! ! !<->1
Great variety of toppings for hot dogs ! ! Make sure you get the loaded tots ! Great service and 100 % all beef hotdogs .<->1
I 've been here once and really enjoyed it . Our server was n't very friendly . The selection is decent and the buffet part is good . I would visit again .<->1
The food was okay . Overpriced , but at least there 's unlimited soda refills .<->0
Great food and beer , ownership cares and responds quickly to any and all feedback !<->1
The coffee is amazing ! It is fresh does n't have that bitter aftertaste . I will definitely be coming back !<->1
This place is so good ! I 'm a vegetarian and they are very vegetarian friendly . They have vegetarian pho , vegetable broth , vegetarian potstickers and egg rolls ! Super good , definitely recommend it this place .<->1
I go eat there at least once a week . Love the food & the staff is great they are usually slammed because it 's only two people working<->1
Tried this place for the first time yesterday ! Its delicious ! They make the sushi right there or you can get a noodle bowl made to order . Its quick easy and fresh . Definitely a place to check out !<->1
3.5 starsGreat for take out . The carne asada burrito was doused in awesome sauce which made the flavor pop along with the meat , cheese and guacamole .<->2
food is always fresh and delicious . coach special and greek chicken salad are on the must - try list . they also have good burgers . i went their once a week and it is such a good time .<->1
My girlfriend sent me a cake and breakfast for my birthday . Both were absolutely delicious ! Cake is 3 days old and kept in the fridge . It just gets better and better each time I eat another slice !<->1
The food was good they have some unique items on the menu , the service was okay they took a long time .<->2
Convenient and rapid delivery . The insalata is relatively fresh , penne marinara savory though a little bit oily with mediocre desert of strawberry cheese cake . Overall about average .<->1
Went in for lunch , fast service and amazing food ! It was a hot a day and we where crushing waters and the server was on point the entire time .<->1
Had a great time here the other night with a few friends ! Fantastic live music & food ! Best nachos I have had in a long time . Will be returning :)<->1
I love this place . It 's a grocery store and sells hot food .<->1
Delicious food ! Highly recommend the chef special with the three rolls ! The Japanese lasagna roll is amazing as well as Drago and kamikaze !<->1
A neighborhood staple . Ca n't say enough about McFate . Always have the best beer , amazing customer service , upbeat atmosphere , and some of the best food I 've ever come across at a brewery . Try the Grape Escape pizza you wo n't be disappointed !<->1
Heritage is a beautiful , smart space with a warm , welcoming staff celebrating creative , delicious food and drink . Madison is growing up fast thanks to establishments like this . Great work . Ca n't wait to go back .<->1
Pretty good food , not terrible pricing , at least for being inside a casino hotel . If you 're looking for about $ 65 meal for two and are having trouble finding that in the casino , this is a pretty good option ...<->1
A must for anyone looking for the best ambiance in Vegas . Right on the strip and across from the Bellagio fountains . The food is consistently on point ! Do n't miss out on this one !<->1
Everything that we ordered was excellent . I 'd definitely recommend the spiked mango lassi and the chicken pie . Service was top notch as . well<->1
Service was laughable ... simple breakfast took 30 minutes ... for the first person , then another 15 minutes for the other 3 . The timing was completely off , everyone around us was ticked off . Will never go back .<->0
Best BBQ sandwich and sauce I ever bought . The guys were very nice to talk too . They cater events . I ca n't wait to eat there again . Great , Great , Great<->1
Modern setting . Nice classic rock soundtrack . Professional staff . Excellent steaks . Try the Baked Alaska for dessert . I like this place over other steakhouses on the Strip . Would like to visit again .<->1
This place is awesome . All the food was really good . The Kobe Ssam actually comes with real wasabi - first time I ever tried that . Be careful with it ! Stuff is stronger than you would believe .<->1
Dead and went to heaven cheeeeeeeeese and fudge my goodness how can you go wrong , a must if you 're in da area . USA all da way !<->1
My husband says " Yelp reviews are great at this coffee shop " . Let 's Go - so glad we did . Good food , comfortable atmosphere - awesome .<->1
Very good food ! I was not disappointed . I will be returning and telling my friends . I passed by here everyday I and had to try it . The Bier brat was great . Nice quiet place , nice pictures and atmoshere<->1
The vegan sandwiches are out of this world ! I love having great food while supporting a local business AND a great cause . The staff is friendly and helpful and it 's a great place to hang out after you eat , too .<->1
Been coming here for 8 years ! ! ! Love the food and service ! ! ! Bring my family every time they come to town guaranteed to be great .<->1
1st time here . Great service . Pho was very tasty ! Spring rolls are wrapped really tightly , I like that . Large portions . Would definitely come back when I 'm in this area .<->1
Great food , fast service , clean , just remember to take a knife and fork . First time customer and I highly recommend this place .<->1
It was the best Tapas in Vegas and for the price , would probably still be ( even with the addition of serrano and Jaleo ) . I miss this place !<->1
Nice place ... Food was delish ! We had the softshell crab , arctic char and steak hache .. everything was perfect ! The sticky ginger cake was simply amazing ! We 'll definitely be back !<->1
Regular KFC . Quick service this weekend . Easy , greasy dinner .<->2
Incredibly slow Drive - through service at midnight on Saturday ! I 'll get back to you if I ever get my food .<->1
On y va ppour la paella ( poêlon dans lequel on prépare le mets du même nom ) , les ramequins à crème brulée mais moi j'y vais pour le Turron , un nougat espagnol . Excellent service , vraiment<->1
Wow wow wow wow wowI'm a ice cream / milk shake fan . E here with my son , he got a natural strawberry stick he dipped it in chocolate and candies . I got the best milkshake ever , Orgasim foe the mouth<->1
We had the Dixie breakfast meatloaf and it was fantastic ! Plus the service was friendly and fast !<->1
Great service super friendly workers ! ! Lots and lots of flavors and the taste is FANTASTIC ! ! Definitely taking the family on a regular basis ! !<->1
THis place was so so , nothing great to go out of your way for . I ordered a breakfast burrito , my husband got a Torta and chicken and fries for the kids . The price was fair<->2
Awesome salads and wraps . First time I walked in I was a Lil intimidated by the huge chalk board ! Kinda have to study the thing before u order ! Love the ranch dressing<->1
I ordered about 5 dishes and everything was really fresh and good . love the wasabi sauce . i will love to come back and try the udon soup .<->1
Their happy hour is delicious ! $ 2 margs ca n't be beat ! Service was fast and attentive !<->1
Eww they found a rat in the watercress ! ! ! They took it away discretely , did n't bother to sanitize the area and carried on as if nothing happened .<->0
Raising Cane 's is simply amazing . Best fast food joint and will definitely satisfied your chicken strip craving .<->1
Blaaaahh ! ! This place is so expensive makes the froyo taste like crap . If you need to waste some money just because then this is your place . Spoon " half " ful cost me 8 dollars .<->0
Very grateful to have this place close to where I live ! The food is fantastic , this is my type of restaurant : organic food , gluten free options , fresh , delicious ... The staff is great , courteous and friendlyThankful<->1
Good food , just the right spice on my fra diavlo . Ravioli was ok , nothing special . Service was a little slow but was busy .<->2
Got a large rare beef special . Soup was n't very special and there was n't a lot of beef for a large size but there is enough noodle to get you full .<->2
basic food , nothing special , but all tasted good . Limited menu , funny wine selection , no multipuciano , or other usual italian wines . Just the popular basics . Right next to Goodwill , but better than you 'd expect<->2
Always great service , and the food is excellent ! The shrimp louie sandwich is my go - to , but everything is great :)<->1
Great food , drink and service . Had the fish tacos , chicken tinga , jicama salad & beetroot ceviche . Would order everything again , except the beetroot ( which was fine , but not amazing ) . Overall , super cozy and great experience .<->1
Went here for a company luncheon and was so surprised at how absolutely DELICIOUS everything was ! ! ! Tuna Poke and the Cauliflower appetizers were amazing ! ! ! Sweet staff and funky decor . Will definitely be back !<->1
This place is great . The donuts are excellent and the employees are very nice .<->1
Best cakes ever ! ! ! I ve used them a few times for a few different occasions and always went over and beyond my expectations ! ! ! Not only do the cakes look good but the taste even better ! ! ! Thanks Ash ! ! !<->1
The food was average , regular chain restaurant food . Our waitress was wonderful , and super helpful - always available when we needed her . Unfortunately they got my daughter 's order wrong so we had to wait for her food .<->2
Best pizza in town we always go there my friends family we enjoy # 1 place I do recommend that place to anybody would like good enjoy .<->1
I would never recommend this place . Expensive and got nothing on Bolsa . Over priced and Bo Luc Loc was horrible . Not marinated and served no lettuce or seasoning and lemon was offered . Pho was not any better .<->0
Very good fish and chips . Never had to wait . Prices were reasonable .<->1
Solid little burger place . Quick service . Clean restaurant . Food was good , no real complaints . Just probably would n't go out of my way to go there again .<->1
Oh my goodness ... jammie wearing , smiling , friendly servers ... a Cup of Bread ... java ... delicious and now my new fave place<->1
The wife and I stopped by to pick up a few groceries .. It appears that they mainly stock snacks and chips . Sea food city is clear across town but it is a trip we are now willing to make ..<->2
I 've been here a few times . Everything I 've had here is pretty good . My favourite is the lemon chicken and the soups are pretty good ( tom yum & chicken corn )<->1
Really good food but make sure you check your drive thru bag before you leave because they always forget stuff .<->1
This is a fun little store . The one inside of Flamingo is tiny . It 's hard to walk around between the merchandise , staff and other customers . We avoid that location . Mandalay bay store is nice and big .<->1
Good food , affordable , open late and the chef will make adjustments for your spice level .<->1
We ordered fish and chips and enchiladas . The enchiladas were made with the wrong sauce and the fish had a really strong taste and was not well seasoned . I ended up eating only the fries :/<->0
Best sweet potatoe tots I have had . The PB & J plus bacon burger is infamously delightful .<->1
Killer coffee and great staff . A quintessential coffee shop . It 's my shop of choice whether I am on the go or looking to settle in for a moment to enjoy my coffee with a book , some work , or a friend .<->1
Rocks , paper , scissors ... choose rocks .. cuz thier jynormous tortillas rock ! Not to mention their machaca ... plus every other thing I have ever had there ... I like the South location the best , but Cactus will do when heading North .<->1
Great , friendly staff . Food is was great I got the tonkatsu curry . The pork was a little dry but over all great dinning experience .<->1
Loveeeee the pink flamingo ! Great for their smoothies and juices . All nekters run different promotions .<->1
I usually get the BBQ mix plate and its good , however the spicy chicken and pulled pork were very dry and not much flavor .<->0
Nekter is life . It keeps me healthy . It keeps my poops regular . And it makes my skin glow like a healthy 11 year old girl . Nekter<->1
Fresh and hospitality . The build is old and crowed it needs restoration and a bigger place . Employees are nice and the place is family oriented . The prices are a little bit high for breakfast .<->1
Beautifull place with excelent food , great service and ambience . I strongly recommend it if you want to try anything out of the ordinary .<->1
Been here a couple of times , and it always a good time . Good music . Nice crowd . Not much beer on tap , but you wo n't go thirsty .<->1
In Cod we Trust is best fish taco I 've ever tasted ... So good especially when jamming to some old school hip hop . The cocktails delicious and the staff friendly and attentive<->1
The Carne Asada burrito was probably the best burrito I 've ever had . No need for sauced or anything ! Staff was extremely helpful , courteous , and happy . Definitely recommend giving this place a try !<->1
I had the rolled tacos . Heavenly ! ! ! With ample guacamole and sour cream and shredded cheese . And the price ca n't be beat .<->1
Great place and atmosphere . Our waitress Hailey was very good and attentive . Food was good and fast service .<->1
Good healthy food . Good prices . Good service . Love the Kung pow chicken . Take out is popular .<->1
I jumped in for a quick bite to eat . Quick and easy . The sauces were hot ( a little too hot for me , but hey I am white ) but good . Would definitely come back . Felt authentic as well . + 5<->1
Great place . A little loud on Friday night but feels like a great dining / social spot . Appetizers and waitress were very good and timely . Bison burger was good , not so much the Jidori chicken .<->1
Crepes were delicious . We chose both sweet and savory . The Nutella and strawberry crêpe was our favorite . Small space inside and some nice outside tables .<->1
This place . Just adorable . The atmosphere is amazing and the company is even better . Everyone is so friendly and the coffee is very good .<->1
I ca n't say much about this bar since I had only been here for a couple of times . It was recommended by a friend of mine and I went there one night . Drinks were great though .<->2
I really love Tiffany 's pizza . We order for work frequently and it 's always been very satisfying ! !<->1
We travel here . We walked by this place and decided to try it after we already had a bad japanese restaurant for dinner . I read their sign " Best ramen in town # 1 " I ordered Tom Yum BBQ pork . It was good .<->1
First time here at district one and I 'm glad we came . Ask the Chef to do a tasting menu for you and you wo n't be disappointed . A must try restaurant here in Vegas .<->1
My family and I really enjoyed our lunch ! Everything we ordered tasted delicious , and my husband thought they had the best chicken & waffles !<->1
Nice place with good and simple menu . Service was really good as well . Try their eggs Benedict or Goldilocks<->1
Love this place the best hot sandwiches in Vegas and the place is open 24 hours a place we will always visit .<->1
Amazing food and service ! With quality authentic Mexican taste and great vibes from Kensington market ! The service felt like you were sitting in a Mexican home ! Beautiful ! You got ta eat here !<->1
The pesto hummus is amazing ! Also love the Date Me pizza . Great atmosphere and music add to a fun , chill vibe . Will definitely be back !<->1
Sushi is good . Prices are decent . Service is a bit slow , super slow if you order take out . Expect to wait about 40 minutes for your take - out order . Happy hour is a great deal .<->1
Food was good but an incident involving a guest and a cook through everything off balance . To bad because the waitress was awesome .<->2
This place is amazing ! The food is great , and the employees are very friendly and helpful . The employee who helped me was named Tay , and he is a great and friendly employee . Will define rely be back 110 % .<->1
Their Shwarma is fantastic . Tastes pretty good . Can make it better with cooking it little more and it is little pricey .<->1
Love this place ! It 's especially nice in the summer on the outdoor patio . The chips , cheese dip , and fajita quesadillas are the best and the service is super fast !<->1
We 've always gone to another well know sushi place around the same area but we decided to try this place & we 're so glad we did . Definitely our new sushi spot . Great food & even better service .<->1
I love everything about it . Great college dive . I get it every time I return to Kent .<->1
Not too bad . It 's dive with a nice touch . Went there for lunch and a beer . Food was average , beer was cold , and sports were on . Ca n't complain too much .<->1
Loved this place ! ! ! Everything we tried was amazing . Salsas , guac , quest , multiple tacos ... def have to go here ! You 'll be glad you did . And the restaurant is very large so you should n't have to wait !<->1
el mejor retauant que he comido y disfutado de la misica y la vaca a las tarascas muy delicios<->1
Terrible - How would you like to bite into your sandwich and have HAIR in it ? ? Disgusting .<->0
Our favorite place to visit when in LV ! Highly recommend the truffle fries or the gooey fries !<->1
Absolutely the BEST pizza I have had ! Sal and the staff are awesome and friendly .<->1
Stopped in here for the tour with a big group of guys during my bachelor party . Great tour , great beers , and great pretzels . Only one critique , " Beverly " needs a sister about half way through .<->1
Sophie was crude rude and charged us for hot water will never return .. No wonder there was no line and no cover<->0
Bonne qualité avec ambiance agréable et authentique ! Seul bémol : l'assiette n'est pas bien garnie ... outre le met principal , il n'y a pas d'accompagnement , ce qui est assez décevant .<->2
Not a huge sushi eater but found several items to love . Spicy crab roll , garlic chicken , Lobster roll , Popcorn Lobster roll ... worth the AYCE price .<->1
I 've always liked this place . The service is great and I 've always been taken care of very well . The only reason for 4 stars is that it 's a small place and tends to get packed and have long waiting lines .<->1
Holy cheese buns ! The Florentine cookies are pretty outta this world too ! So happy someone recommended this place to me . I 'll drive there from the SE anytime . So so good .<->1
Going to La Gourmandine makes me truly , genuinely , sincerely happy . That is all you need to know .<->1
Small bites , good food ... Bring friends and conquer each station . Street taco in Vegas achievement unlocked .<->1
Not as outstanding as reviews led me to believe but so much better for breakfast than something like iHop or Denny 's .<->1
Worst buffet I have ever eaten in my life . They were literally running out of food . I left the place still hungry .<->0
Its amazingly awesome food man .. ! ! ! My wife is obsessed with it and she loves to have it after a stressful day at work !<->1
Pretty good bubble tea ! Ordered a Thai tea along with w coconut milk tea . Both good but found the Thai tea to be somewhat too sweet for my taste and the boba was slightly over cooked ; a smidge too mushy .<->1
The wing flavors are good although I have had better . Expensive for bar food . A great sports bar atmosphere that is for sure .<->2
Amber is the pint to get . Tacos were delicious but meats could have been chopped more finer . Overall a very good experience and a great vibe .<->1
Overpriced . Decent food . Unimaginative . Not worth the premium dollar . The shrimp appetizer is excellent . Been twice , unimpressed for the cost . Better value elsewhere .<->0
My fave dishes are spaghetti with meat sauce and extra cheese , and steak with spaghetti . Their drinks always seem to be a bit small tho . Good price . Not noisy .<->1
This is the best breakfast place ever ! The food is sooooo good , you have to try the hash .<->1
I 've ordered from them many times and it 's always been great . Delivery is super fast . Probably the best value for the money from any place I order from .<->1
Excellent food and reasonably priced . No bathroom or ice . Other than that its great . Definitely going on my lunch spot list .<->1
best of the station casino buffets.check out the desserts at the front of the cafe , if you just want a rad quick sweet for 2 $<->1
The ambience is great and the food is amazing . The rye bread in duck fat dish is really good . Hazar was our server and he 's awesome ! Will definitely be returning .<->1
Exceptional establishment , service was outstanding Michelle AKA Chuck was phenomenal ! Polite , knowledgeable and pretty easy on the eyes ! The lasagna was amazing and the bruschetta was out of this world ! I highly recommend<->1
Great service and great waiters and waitresses every time we come . They know our orders by heart .<->1
Food was just okay . It was cooked properly just not real tasty . The portion size is good and the service was solid .<->2
We love the harp great food and great service . 4th of July to see the fire works every year<->1
Black bean soup and bone in Prime Rib = Awesome . One of the top 3 prime ribs in my lifetime - highly recommended ! !<->1
Best burger in town ! ! ! Amazing service , delicious food ! ! This is a must try if you are in the mood for a burger ! Go right now ! ! !<->1
Got the Chille Relleno Burrito , enchilada style it was busy , but worth the wait , call in advance if you are in a rush for lunch .<->1
Cute clean place . The service was excellent . The food is very very average . I would only eat there again if the prices were equal to their food .<->0
Pretty good meal , older crowd and would go back for easy italian . Orders caesar salad ( very good and fresh ) , penne with chicken / asparagus ( ok ) and flour less chocolate cake ( amazing )<->2
Excellent . Food is outstanding , fresh and oh so tasty . New waitstaff , just as excellent as my last visit .<->1
Late lunch with my love . Came due to the great reviews . Reviews did n't do it justice . Food was excellent , service fantastic , and very affordable . We will be back !<->1
I came here last October . Love their lobster soup . The service is good . Will take my parents here again this month .<->1
Omg ! This place rocks . Delicious and fresh magaritas , none of that syrupy crap . The happy hour $ 3 tacos and $ 5 margaritas are amazing . Definitely get the Baja fish taco , small but packed with tons of flavor !<->1
Absolutely amazing Vietnamese food . Fresh , clean ingredients . Complex flavors . Nice staff . Reasonably priced .<->1
Worst Dunkin ever terrible management . Slow slow slow . Done with the incompetence and terrible coffee . ( love Dunkin coffee . They just butcher it here )<->0
This is a great , friendly spot I stumbled upon while attending a training . The espresso is great - not bitter at all ! Definitely would visit again !<->1
It 's like Mediterranean chipotle ! Food is delicious and fresh . The only reason it did n't get 5 stars is the dressing situation on salad . They need oil and vinegar or something like that before yogurt sauce .<->1
Perfect place for a treat - everything 's amazing especially the brioche , croissants and salads . A little pricey for some , but makes for a special visit .<->1
Decent food terrible service practically have to beg the staff to wait on you in the bar area<->0
Awesome pizza and a really well run establishment ! Yum !<->1
Not a fan of this place . Looks run down and the drinks / food are very average . Also , the place has the feel of a diner , not a coffee shop , and has a weird vibe in general .<->0
This is place serves the worst Indian Food . The food is tasteless and Naan was very hard to eat .<->0
Coconut Black Tie Coffee was GREAT ! A nice little drink before 6.5 hours on a plane to Kauai ! Takes a bit to get your drink because this place is slammed with travelers but worth the stop .<->1
I went to here few times , this is my favorite Chinese restaurant in the town ! A very great place to stay with family . The favor here is different to other restaurants and the price is cheaper .<->1
Loved the place . Excellent subs , clean place , quick and friendly service , reasonable prices ... What more can you ask for ? Try it !<->1
The food was amazing ! I really liked it even tho you had to go to the counter to order your food<->1
Such a great place . New and amazing ways of types of banh mi . I love it ! Such a friendly environment as well !<->1
Nice coffee place . WiFi with cozy couches . Has a large selection of expresso machines for purchase .<->2
what a BURRITO ! the best of the best of the best ( outside Texas ) The BIGGEST problem is they have 2 - 3 seating places , so during winter you have to eat outside or standing up with the crowd , that 's waiting for their order .<->1
Quality sushi that uses top of the line nori for their rolls and it makes a big difference . The spicy tuna roll has a nice kick to it and the katana roll is tasty as well .<->1
Frozen veggies inside my omelette , sent it back and got a new one . Same result . Have n't been back .<->0
D'z dogs is the best . All the employees seem to want to be here . Nothing is better then when your food provider is excited about what he / she is doing . Come try a scorpion dog . ! ! !<->1
Great variety of beer and food . Love how you can bring your dog outside and it 's totally acceptable if your dog climbs on the table and no one thinks it 's weird ! Awesome place for lovers of dogs and beer .<->1
This place sucks bad they have horrible customer service just so who ever knows if they plan on making a delivery they took always 2 hours telling me it would take 45 mins bullshit ! ! !<->0
Terrible ... bitter cookies , flavorless cakes ... and EXPENSIVE . Paid $ 7 for 2 cookies that were bitter and meh . Avoid . Disappointed !<->0
Love this place so much ! The staff is great and the overall atmosphere is the best of any Chinese restaurant I 've ever been to . Very authentic and aesthetically pleasing . Oh , and the food is amazing , too !<->1
Nothing to rave about . It was good , not great . Lacks meat portion in burritos . It 's a little hole in the wall place . Indoor and outdoor seating . Not open all day .<->2
" I wish I could convince myself that pa is incapable of making a chicken wing that is worth buying " - me , tonight . Overcooked , impressively LOW quality raw product , good sauce . A shame , really , but definitely a pass for this place .<->0
My girlfriend and I came here one late night for reverse happy hour and it did not disappoint ! Food was excellent , service was great and you ca n't beat the prices . Will be coming here a lot ! !<->1
The food here is so good ! They could use a bigger building , every time I go in the place is busy and packed .<->1
Good drinks , but there tends to be a bit of a wait for your drink . That said , it has a nice atmosphere and is in a good place to go for a walk with you coffee .<->2
Nothing to get overly excited about . Good sandwich . The bobby is a unique idea , but I wish it was toasted .<->2
I ordered take out from them , the maki rolls had way too much sauce and the portions were small compared to the price . It was way too expensive for what they offered . I wo n't be coming back to this restaurant .<->0
All I can say is that I was nt happy with my dining experience , and they should look into getting rid if the waiting area in the middle of the restaurant . Such an odd and uncomfortable spot .<->0
Food and service was great ! The snow crabs were perfect in size and we loved the seasoned Cajun fries<->1
I would suggest you guys change your recipe for chow mein or at least state clearly that your chow mein contains 0 noodles , even though chow mein directly translates to " fried noodles "<->0
Ca n't say much when the service and the food was just terrible going downhill quickly and we live very close never going back again Olive Garden beats it all the way around .<->0
Ordered lamb burger medium , but next time I 'll ask for med - rare . It was very good . Greek fries pretty awesome . Also got chicken shawarma platter , a bit dry but the favors were nice .<->1
Wednesday 60 cent delicious wings I work by this location and as often as I can go for 60 cent wings they prepare them as you request . The service here is top notch .<->1
go for happy hour ! Full size app portions for less than 1/2 off . Assorted cocktails and specific wines also reduced . Was pleasantly surprised by quality of the food as well .<->1
Dobra Tea is definitely the place to learn about teas . The menu of teas is phenomenal . This is the place to go to learn all about tea . They 're beer teas are the best hot weather cold teas .<->1
I miss barrio now that I live back on the east coast . The tacos here are amazing and the queso dip . . . i have dreams about the queso dip .<->1
Landed late and had dinner at this restaurant located inside of the Rio Hotel . The service and food were very good . It 's a large restaurant and nicely decorated . The rice soup and baby bok choy was awesome .<->1
Great food and service ! For sure coming back next time I 'm in town ! The short ribs and garlic shrimp were awesome ! ! !<->1
This place is great . Ambiance is really nice . Had the signature corn bread and empanadas and they were awesome ! Chicken tortilla soup was the best I 've had ! Love this place .<->1
I ordered super nachos delivery and they have were the worst . They came without beans , which are supposed to be included obviously , and the cheese is fake . Horrible Mexican food .<->0
One of the best breweries in Arizona , doing every beer the right way . The staff is always willing to suggest the perfect beer for your desired needs and very friendly .<->1
Always excited to see new Pita Jungle locations . Food is great as always . Will go back soon .<->1
Best Chinese food ever ! Super healthy and always prompt with delivery ... my fist choice<->1
Best thai in town ! # 38 , with a cup of # 9 and a thai tea . Perfection . Small and cozy with great service .<->1
Authentic flavors , helpful staff who hustle to get you served . I 'm sold ! This is my favorite jalapeño cream cheese of any of the valley 's bagel shop options . Try with the Asiago bagel !<->1
Pathetic service . Good food . Do n't expect to be served in 45 mins . Most of visitors are here for hours .<->0
Breakfast at the Bouchon - absolutely lovely . Started with the pastry basket - their strawberry croissant is a MUST ! ! ! Croque Madame is delish ~ Their french toast is unique and also very tasty .<->1
Had the PS1 to go platter and it was delicious . Freshly made and the ginger and wasabi were a great compliment . Would definitely recommend it for any sushi lover .<->1
Casual comfortable . Had excellent smoked duck pizza as part of restaurant week meal which was incredible deal . $ 45 for 3 courses and 50 % of wine . Wonderful experience .<->1
High price , low quality and bad taste . It 's not Chinese food nor American food . Do n't recommend it .<->0
What a disappointment . Good Memories of Gyro Time on W . Charleston have all faded . Gyro Time was once tasty . Now just serving overpriced calories with a bad attitude .<->0
Had a rehearsal dinner here for a wedding and was very pleased . Staff was very attentive and helpful . Had a great time !<->1
We had a party of seven on a very busy Friday night . They got us in with only a 5 minute wait . Service was excellent and the burgers were cooked perfectly . Good food , good service and great company !<->1
The service has gotten so much better ! Super friendly and the drinks are on point ! I 've been coming back regularly and glad I did ! Thank you !<->1
Simply put ... one of the best breakfasts I 've ever had . Delicious all around , and the buttermilk pancakes , OMG , INCREDIBLE ! With a few conventions in town , service was slow ( very busy ) but oh so worth the wait .<->1
Ambience was great , my waiter was great , and the lavender latte was delicious . Comfy little couches to relax with a book on the patio .<->1
The burger was good , but the fries was nt that good . You can see the guys making the burger from the small window it seems everything is good inside .<->1
Excellent restaurant , comparable à Fleur d'Asie ou bien le Sawadee . Si vous avez envie d'un bon vietnamien / Cambodgien , c'est la place à aller dans le coin . En plus , ce restaurant est un apporté votre vin .<->1
I found my favorite Mexican food finally . Went here Friday night and came back Saturday for lunch . I told the manager that I 'd see him tomorrow .<->1
The shahi makhni was pretty good along with the naan . Malai kofta was meh . Will eat here again .<->1
Warm staff , efficient service , delicious drinks and food . I would rate it higher but it 's small , cramped , noisy and lacking a drive through . Definitely would recommend for take out orders .<->2
Awesome restaurant inside putters , the wings are the best . They are the biggest and juiciest I 've tried in town ! Friendly service . Love it ! Wanna come back to try more stuff their pizza next .<->1
They have soda bread for St . Patrick 's Day ( order early ) . Really great fresh bread and cute little store .<->1
I 've ordered the wasabi tuna burritos and the order online is the most efficient way during the weekdays .<->1
Great atmosphere , friendly staff ! Service was ok and Food was just ok . Need more variety ! Want to come back for the games and karaoke !<->2
Good food , recommend it . Food gets 4 stars , but not drive thru . It 's terrible . Regret it every time . 2 cars ahead of me , waiting 20 minutes . NOT EXAGGERATING . 20 minutes . But , food is good .<->2
Excellent salads , I had veal Oscar and Mary had linguini putanesca . Both very good , would order them again .<->1
I am giving them back two stars . While I still am very upset about their inconsistent delivery policies . The food is just really good . We 've tried replacing our Thai nights with a restaurant closer , but simpy not as good .<->2
stunning vegan grub ! The Big Wack is bar none my go to burger in AZ , maybe the earth . Love the wings . Sauce is tangy , unique and totally delectable ! Always solid service and beautiful design and decor .<->1
Amazing meal ! Everything was delicious . I love that the portions were all a good size . My friend got an appetizer for her meal that definitely enough to eat . My veal chop was huge !<->1
Really good food and drinks too . The wait was long but the food and service made up for it . Everyone enjoyed their plates immensely .<->1
Excellent food with a great price . Friday they even have poke ( poke ee ) hawaiian shaved friday through sunday . coworker and myself make it a religious visit fridays . Do n't forget the kool - aid !<->1
Booster Juice is my go to freshly squeezed juice place . I will get it anywhere anytime . The liberty village location is convenient for me because I work very close and I go there after work .<->1
Nice place for a good meal . The staffs are welcoming . The price is so good compared to the quality of food . Bubble Tea is one thing that brings me here .<->1
The most not authentic Mexican meal . I felt ill for two hours after probably from bad meat . Tacos awful and food was cold . I would not recommend<->0
Best Karaoke bar in Las Vegas ! ! ! If you 're visiting Las Vegas or live here already , come visit this place ! The manager Antonio made our experience amazing ! It is a must stop .<->1
Stopped in for Birthday dessert and it did not disappoint . Excellent desserts . We ended up trying their salad and the French onion soup as well and both were delicious !<->1
My first visit to Jinya ... loved it . Tonkatsu Ramen with fresh garlic and corn ... I will be back soon<->1
Always request Mandy . Best waitress on the strip . Friendly and professional . Definitely be back .<->1
Now serving a Breakfast Special , Thursday - Sunday 7AM to Noon for $ 4.99 including a Bloody Mary or a Mimosa ! ! ! You ca n't find a better deal than that !<->1
So cute - very similar to LGO grocery layout . Food was decent and service was on point . Really just a wonderful place to grab brunch or breakfast with some gal pals .<->1
Just ok , dirty dining area , just so so sub , no bottled coke in stock . I am not a fan of this Subway . Only good part of my visit they take Apple Pay .<->0
Friendly place for great traditional American food ! Inside and outside eating areas . Fresh and flavorful !<->1
AWESOME SERVICE ! Thanks ADRIENNE ! I always look forward to my Tuesday meetings at Egg Works because I know the food and service is far greater than the 5 Stars rating !<->1
Great food , lively environment and really good service . Recommended and will return !<->1
Great service but ... COLD FRIES . I hate cold fries . Dining room was n't as clean as it should have been . I wo n't be returning to this location .<->0
The services from the waitress can be improve . Food choice is limited but price is high . Cheese chicken needs min 2 servings to order which is not cheaper but the portion is small . will never go again .<->0
The lamb biryani was really good . The biryani quantity was really impressive . Filled my big tummy . Went here for dinner and was not disappointed . Mango lassi was ok .<->1
Very good . Upscale crowd and prices reflect that but still food very good .<->1
Great place ! I had the Carne Asada burrito and it was really good ! Staff are all really friendly . I ca n't wait to go back !<->1
Service completely sucks and the food is slightly better than what you could buy from a vending machine or Kwik Trip<->0
Not very good service . This morning after ordering coffee we find that there is no fresh coffee in there brewing beakers . When we did get our coffee it was cold . At least they had a smile on there face . Poor attitude .<->0
Terrible food . Do n't come here . Never have a left half a sushi / sashimi boat unfinished . Piece of uni sushi still on it as well<->0
This place is good , so good the service is rude . The host ca n't do the one thing she 's supposed to do , greet the customers .<->0
The only thing I really enjoyed was the music . Food was overpriced for the quality I experienced . I doubt I 'll be back .<->0
Best pizza , wings and their specialty fries .. cute place inside and staff was super friendly . . We were super happy that we finally found a great pizza place and not be ridiculously expensive<->1
The menu is great but the real fun is when you tell what you like in drink i . e . sour , bitter , spice etc and let them work their magic . Love taking people here and the staff is great .<->1
Hands downs beats out cupcakey , cupcake lane . Very Good , and best of all cheaper than the competitors . The cupcakes are moist , not to sugary , and the best is the Coconut flavor cupcake .<->1
The foods are so good . Very traditionally Cantonese dim sum ! If you like dim sum you should try . ? ? ? ! ? ? ?<->1
This is twice now . You either fail to hire a capable staff or you are understaffed . No exaggeration twenty minute wait just to order . Big mistake asking me to fill out the survey .<->0
Good chinese delivered in 30 min , very well and appropriately packaged ( sweet and sour sauce packaged separate from the pork / chicken / whatever so the breading stays crisp ) .<->1
Got the calzone on delivery ( 45 minutes ) with pepperoni . It literally poured grease out of it and I could n't eat half of it . I know pepperoni will add grease to the calzone , but this was crazy .<->0
The food is fantastic pub food , the cocktails are great and the service is outstanding . It 's a great night out .<->1
Pass , menu is hard to find a good choice . A big fan of Freddie 's beers . So you choose .<->0
At CLE . Need food . Need beverage . This place will do . Unimaginative cuisine served without drama .<->0
Terrible service and food . Scrambled eggs without any type of bread . Subpar quiche . Overdressed salad . Very confused staff .<->0
Very tasty food , pretty down to earth fresh , location is a 50/50 shot at success and competition is strong in this market<->1
Went here for dinner . The food was good and it came at a reasonable price . This meal was a good value . Plus it is right on Freemont Street with all of the lights .<->1
The black tea / oolong blend was amazing and nico was an excellent host . We 'll be back !<->1
Omg food is so good . Nothing like the other viet restaurants around . The coconut snail is amazing . It 's a must try when you come here .<->1
By far , the best local honey ! Chipotle infused , cinnamon and bourbon are my favorites . Honey samplers for only $ 3 each make great gifts for friends & coworkers .<->1
The food was amazing and the biggest selection of hot sauce I have ever seen . The server was knowledgable of menu and very friendly . A must visit if you are down with good food .<->1
Crespelle stuffed with mushrooms were excellent but everything else was a bit average given the price . Interesting decor ... mannequin in the roof room was a bit creepy though .<->2
Good selection of Asian food . Average prices . Fast service .<->1
Kristina very nice bartender makes great cocktails trendy spot open floor plan creates great open ambience and I love the pizza !<->1
This place was great ! I really enjoyed the burgers . Will definitely be coming back real soon .<->1
The waitress was very rude . We just ask her a simple question and what she answered was shocking ! ! And their sushi was pretty ordinary ... not recommending at all ! !<->0
Tuna tartar tacos and abc burger are delicious .<->1
Great authentic tacos . No fillers . We ordered 57 assorted tacos for our office and they were very accommodating . Prices are also great . I will for sure be a returning customer !<->1
First visit since the name change . Tried the cake beer , it was light and refreshing . New decor makes for a more trendy and low key atmosphere .<->1
At first the menu descriptions seemed strange but the flavors were awesome . Pesto pizza and fresh pasta were fantastic .<->1
So comforting and for a great cost . The food is n't mind blowing , but " just " really good and with huge portions - definitely worth more than the price you 'll pay .<->1
Have eaten here a few times and yesterday ordered take out . Food was perfect and service has been great and quick every time !<->1
For tacos they are a little pricy . They are good but I 'm not sure that I would want to pay that much for tacos . Very clean and nice decor .<->1
Service is n't so great but the coffee is always good<->2
Had a great classic breakfast for a fair price , in a traditional american diner atmosphere . Would go again anytime !<->1
The food is okay but nothing to travel too far to experience . The pizza was good .<->2
Great food ... Had red curry chicken with rice , egg rolls , raggoons ... And hot & sour soup ... All but the soup was above average in taste ! ! The hot and sour soup has a strong vinegar taste , not a fan of .<->1
I love their shrimp and eggs . A very simple dish but always a hit ! It usually takes them less than 10min to get this dish out . Portions are good . Their lunch menu are great to share with friends .<->1
Good experience , clean friendly place . Food was fresh and served hot . I tried the Agedashi Tofu and the Tiger Roll , both were very good .<->1
Bad slow service , if I went into details about examples why I " d be writing a novel . But I wo n't be back to this location .<->0
Very tasty food ! The BBQ burger was unbelievable ! Fries are to die for ! Just the right amount of seasoning . Is very pricy in all .<->1
Friendly service with nice atmosphere for dinner and drinks . It has a wide variety of selections from hot pot , grill , skewer , taco , sushi , etc<->1
Very good food huge portions very reasonably priced . Fresh not too salty . Will definitely order again<->1
Great food but you better bring lots of friends to help ! All the food is family size and more than two people can eat . Funky menu on the side wall only , no hand held menus , what 's that about<->1
The food was good and lots of it . You may want to consider sharing a dish with someone .<->1
Very tasty croissants and chocolatines (= chocolate croissants ) . The strawberry pie sample was also quite good .<->1
Awesome ! Great selection of drinks that you can customize 100 ' s of different ways . Very nice and clean store with great staff . Perfect stop for an after work non - alcoholic drink for the ride home .<->1
We loved our breakfast here ! Perfect ! Everything was delicious and fresh . The smoothies are awesome . My husband went nuts over the Nutella coffee ... The service was fantastic .<->1
Probably one of the best burger joints in AZ . I love getting my burger protein style ( no buns , replaced with iceberg lettuce ) . The fries here are amazing ! The best pRt about it is the price . Very very very cheap !<->1
Awesome food and service ! Blows Prosecco away . Large portions and very tasty . Eggplant and chicken parm delicious . Great insalata too .<->1
Sausage / Onion / Pepper Stromboli was really good and price - per - ounce a pretty good deal at ~ $ 8 . The cheese was really stringy , and the sauce is a good compliment ( worth the $ 0.75 charge ... lol ) .<->1
Best burger in a long while . Great job with Hatch Green Chili even for those from New Mexico . Also great Sweet Potato tots , never had such before , unique .<->1
Great choice of Beer and food . White Rajah Beer , Wings dry rub and buffalo chicken dip is a must try . Sloppy nachos is also awesome . Great ambience and good service by staff too . I highly recommend this place .<->1
I can taste the grease in everyrhing . The servers are never consistent and you have to be lucky to get an experienced one . I do n't like how there is noiise cancelation , super loud place .<->0
I drove past this place every day , and decided to finally check it out on an off day . I 'm glad I did . Food was great the service was great and all - around good time . I think I will be back .<->1
Great spaghetti with unbelievable delicious homemade sources . The quantity is plenty too and there are a lot of choices . We 'll come back again .<->1
Wow . Bebimbap burrito for me , pork shoulder noodle bowl for the wife . Great service , relaxing atmosphere . I also heard the burgers are great on the dinner menu . You got ta go .<->1
My favorite Thai place . I 've never had a disappointing meal here . Every curry I try tastes as good as the last .<->1
No complaints . Expensive , but it 's great food and great service . I love how my waiter explained the menu . And the " extras " they threw in was a nice touch .<->1
Amazing at every level , service , food , entertainment . We had the best time celebrating our daughter 21st birthday . Highly recommend .<->1
Great food and lovely atmosphere . I especially enjoyed the olive oil for the bread which learned is from Crete .<->1
Overpriced for just ok Italian food . Veal Parm was pounded very very thin . It was tough and dry .<->0
Nice little burger spot , good food reasonably priced . They have a bunch of options for every taste . The onion rings are really good .<->1
Loved this place ! We had the chorizo and egg bagel and a cranberry bagel . They were both delicious ! I will be back !<->1
Prices have gone UP ! ! Daily and after 8p m specials are n't as good now . The IPA they have on tap is not included in the after 8 special ? ! :( The javi - hot wings are tasty . The " stuffed " burger is just two patties .<->2
I happened to walk in here for an impromptu lunch . The food is good . The real deal . I recommend the Chang Mai and Soup # 2 . Anyone who criticizes this food does not know good Thai .<->1
Love this store ! Everything is clean and orderly and easy to get to . I love the selection of bulk goods ! Also they have a great produce section that is very well priced ! We shop here weekly !<->1
I sure wish this place was still open I just found out it was closed when we tried to go there again . It must be the unreasonable rules of the University<->1
I love this place . Best pizza in Arizona . Not only is there pizza good but wings and everything else . I will drive 30 miles to just have there pizza<->1
Always amazing ! Portobello mushroom sandwich and strawberry shortcake were delicious . The Portobello sandwich is likely the smallest item on the menu . Both items were shared so I did n't have to waddle out !<->1
It was my first time having Guu and it was such a great experience . The food was great , the price is very reasonable and most of all ... the atmosphere is amazing ! ! Definitely check it out ! ! !<->1
Excellent , low key Mexican food . Great for a casual lunch . The staff is friendly and very attentive ... No alcohol served , they do n't have a liquor license<->1
Enjoy the quality food here , one of my favorite for 2013 Beef with asparus , Macarons , Snow crab , King crab , Steak , Chinese food , Fresh pizza , Mussels , Wish I can give them 6 stars<->1
Always fresh here ! Love the free birthday meal too ! Small space so show up early if you want a table . Best to call in advance for take out too .<->1
Very rude male cook . I told him my chicken was overdone snd he said that 's perfect . No customer service w him at all . Rude .<->0
Aaaammmaaazzzing ! Everything about this restaurant is above and beyond . Kale slaw = Love .<->1

What a great addition to the neighborhood ! I absolutely love this place ! Fast , friendly and clean service ! !<->1
this place is amazing . Every item we have gotten here has been awesome , including the veggie panini<->1
I think this place surfs on the nostalgia of its patrons . Must have been really great back in the day ... But not TODAY . Burger was frozen , kind of mushy once cooked . No thrill .<->0
Omg best pizza in Las Vegas ! ! Every time I visit , I come here for a delicious pizza ! ! Amazing each time !<->1
This place is crazy busy . It was n't a great shopping experience , but there 's lots to choose from . They have a Joe Fresh dedicated section , and an electronics section as well . It 's probably better visiting on a weekday .<->2
Awesome small venue to see live music and chill . Check out the upstairs balcony area and bar .<->1
Best carnitas I 've ever had - we often go for Friday dinner to catch Blaine Long 's musical stylings . Friendly servers , good drinks , great food .<->1
Always awesome . They have great flavors with plenty of toppings . Good place to kick back and have dessert .<->1
This place has the best quality Philly steak cheese sandwiches , which I believe is very hard to find out here in Vegas . Great customer ! ! Every time I come here the food is ready fast and delicious !<->1
Best Mexican place by far . Always my go - to when I 'm feeling like a good Taco / burrito .<->1
Third time at this location and same issue occurs , I order online so my order will be available on arrival and still wait 15 minutes . All the employees are too busy working to be human and acknowledge their customers .<->0
I always get the red wow milk . Ca n't go wrong with that . However , I have tried friends ' tea drinks and they are very refreshing ! The only thing is that during busy hours , it 's impossible to park , yikes !<->1
Love the concept , affordable and fun . Portion size in your control and flavour too as you assemble your own stir fry . I loved it !<->1
Food was amazing . The Sunset Roll was worth the trip alone . Making arrangements online ahead of time is a must .<->1
I like to smoke hookah at Luna Lounge , is best place in Las Vegas I some duple apple mix Alfakher with Alnakalh we drink tea and I like couch more comfortable , food amazing also I like music .<->2
Everything we ordered here was delicious . The decor is amazing and entirely made of wood . Just a heads up , it 's standing room only , so do n't expect to get too comfortable ! Loved their selection of cocktails , too .<->1

Best grocery store . Friendly staff , great prices , gas pumps , excellent deli and staff , great produce department , ample parking . I shop there 2x a week for myself and my family of 5 .<->1
I never go wrong when getting coffee or tea here . Black Forest blended is fun and light , while the Chai is great for late evening wind downs . And staff are sweet and attentive .<->1
Fantastic vegan options , love this place . I love the Gobi and dosa . Service can be a bit slow , but the buffet at lunch is pretty decent !<->1
Came here because they served soup dumplings but the green beans were the star of the show<->1
Sitting here just talking to a friend . Noticed someone cleaning where the Frys are stored after cooking . There was food in the storage bin , removed and put into customers bags . I am contacting the health department .<->0
Love the place . Wish it had some more selections but the gluten free options are fair and reasonably priced . The staff is amazing !<->1

The best chicken souvlaki and priced well . Juicy and properly marinaded . Traditional Greek atmosphere and very clean .<->1

Love this place . Have been going here for celebrations for years and not sure why it took me so long to leave a review ! Always great food , service and we always leave stuffed !<->1
waited for my dish for over the 20 min and nothing . usually this place is good but one bad experience ...<->0
Fun dinner . Very nostalgic . Great food . Not everything available for all day breakfast . No vegan options bit they did accommodate us as we are vegetarian . Very friendly and fast service .<->1
The nan bread is the best in town . Perfect spice combinations , great portions , and excellent service . My favourite East Indian take out in Calgary<->1
A Sbarro by any other name ... Located in the Las Vegas MGM Grand , I was expecting above average Italian fare . I think my $ 4 soda was the best part of the meal . Garlic knots were okay . Pepperoni Stomboli ? Meh .<->0
Amazing chicken and waffles . Great service . Great rustic wild mushroom eggs bennie . Will be going back for sure .<->1
Great food , coffee . Wonderful atmosphere . A quality staff that keep the dining area and rest room very clean . Highly recommend .<->1
I have been here a few times to get a juice when going to the mill . I have n't been to the bigger space , but it would take about 20 minutes to order one drink . Very poor customer service .<->0
It was pretty busy for a spring break week , so the service of the food was slow . The Caesar salad was just so so , but my mushroom , pepperoni , sausage pizza was cooked perfectly and very tasty .<->1
Great food . Friday nights are karaoke nights usually . I highly recommend their appetizers . One of my favorite places if I just want a beer and some wings or fried snacks .<->1
I 'll make this short and sweet . My first time for cheese curds , oh yes . Red Ale on Nitro , love it love it love it . Oktoberfest German meal special , are you kidding me ... amazing . Cute & friendly waitress ... does it get any better ?<->1
Was looking for something to eat after watching Logan . Desperately needed something phenomenal to follow up a great film . Randomly saw Yoshi Bento and checked it out . Great food . Had a ramen bowl . Would recommend anything .<->1
Marco 's Pizza is amazing , fantastic tasting pizza ! ! I have ordered for work and picked up to take home co - workers and kid approved . My teenagers at home and staff at work ask for Marco 's Yum :)<->1

Great portion size , high quality chicken , clean establishment<->1
The yogurt is really good but the crepes are excellent , friendly and clean staff . It 's my new favorite place .<->1
Went here for Thanksgiving dinner and loved everything about it ! The food , the ambiance , the customer service ... everything was on point . I will definitely be back for more and recommend it to anyone visiting .<->1
If you want peppers in the potato salad and stale bread , go for it . We spent $ 100 on lousy food that no real Deli would ever serve . Never again<->0
This is a place I tend to end up each time I am in Vegas . It 's exactly what it 's advertises to be , simple food done better .<->1
Not 24 hours change your signs and info on website . Also you have signs all over your building showing 24 Horus but your not .<->0
Great location . The staff are personable and prompt . Burros are crispy and taste better than most lications . Would recommend for your hang over needs<->1
The best coffee and they have coconut milk that goes perfectly with their cold brew . The owner , Jamal , is super friendly and will talk you through the flavours of patties ... Who knew jerk pork could be so amazing !<->1
great food ! pretty affordable and awesome service . everyone is so nice . very quick serving as well :) my go to sushi place .<->1
If you do n't like Cook Out then we just ca n't be friends . Who gives you 10k calories on a platter for $ 5 and the privilege of hearing you get fatter as you take the bag ?<->1
I 'm in love , as should everyone else ! ! If you thinks papa johns is pizza , I truly feel sorry for you . THIS is pizza ! ! Authentic , delicious and worth every penny ! Staff are great too .<->1
Great and quick service . Really liked the options on the menu . Lots of food for a decent price .<->1
The pho is amazing ! The portion size is also larger than a lot of other places so that was a huge plus as well . Wish this place was closer to my house because I would be there very often .<->1
Should have read other reviews before eating here . Got the Mahi mahi plate to go , was so bad that I ended up trashing it at the gate . Not worth it !<->0
1st time here at any " Shake Shack " . First off , it 's overrated ! The burgers are small , but pretty tasty . And expensive ! All items are separate . Three stars was for the cool service , small but tasty burgers & fast service !<->2
Mother 's Day brunch was solid . Nice casual brunch in the ballroom . Food was good . Enough for both kids and adults to enjoy . Would do again for future holidays like Mother 's Day and Father 's Day .<->1
Not busy on a early sat evening , wish we 'd come later to hear the band , had all you can eat fish and chips , it was delicious , our waitress was awesome , very attentive , will definitely be back .<->1
I really like this place . It 's small but cute and the two tofu dishes they have ( hibachi and teriyaki , if I recall correctly ) are very good and huge portions .<->1
Whoaaa I LOVE THIS PLACE ! The spicy chicken wings were the BOMB , also spicy sashimi salad was very decent and shots / drinks were super smooth . Great service , great atmosphere ( they have DJ spinning music every weekend ) . I would definitely come back !<->1
Average but consistent . No amazing food here but a varied menu that can please different taste preferences . Lunch table d'hôte offer nice variety . Service is fine .<->2
Fairly good food if you are seeking a vegetarian based option in the city . The main problem are the tables you have to share with fellow strangers in the dining room creating a prison cafeteria atmosphere<->2
Cams with a group of 4 people on a monday night . The food was amazing ! ! Juicy kababs and the portions were big . The service was great .<->1
Not happy with the price per product the food is over price $ 2.99 for pop that 's like a small cup like McDonald 's unreal then $ 11.99 for a cup of ice cream<->0
Every time we come , we come back ! ! ! Great food , cool atmosphere ! Such a wide selection of good healthy food .<->1
The Tinga Tostada and beef salad were excellent ! ! ! If it were not for the ludicrous wait times this place would get 5 stars .<->1
Ca n't wait to go back to the friendly tavern over the creek ! ! Food and service were outstanding ...<->1
Decent food have a variety of choices and fast service , i like their Vietnamese sandwiches and also the soups<->1
Tried some appetizers , salads , and a few grill items - everything was great . Looking forward to going back and trying one of the hot pots !<->1
First timers and already we feel like regulars . The owner is very friendly and makes you feel like one of the family . AMAZING FOOD ! ! Good vibes and the perfect diner feel . We highly recommend it !<->1
Howard makes one mean Peach cobbler crepe ! I had it with a scoop of apricot gelato . DELICIOUS ! Everyone here is very friendly ! I will be back every time I visit Scottsdale ! ! !<->1
Yeah ... something not cool about this place . Difficult to feel comfortable , nothing special about the food . With so many restaurants in Toronto , with this quality of service , this place probably will not survive much longer .<->0
Ray called me to schedule an appointment and I must say blue devil does a good service and have a really flexible schedule . I am very happy I was able to set service date on my desired date and time<->1
Typical red lobster except for the wait during peak times . Always a long wait ! ! The lobby and bar area is very small so you feel like sardines waiting for a table .<->2
Creative burger joint with a cool ambiance . Fun music , tap beer , miss the old style onion rings ( extra crunchy ) they changed them up so ... Regardless , the burgers & fries are great !<->1
Savannah 's gone , but the group , now go 's to the new bullfrogs cafe , in North Ridgeville . Carrying on Savannahs hope ..<->1
My 2nd favorite happy hour in the valley . Mix Seafood grilled skewers over dirty rice . Is a must try so much food<->1
Hi my name is Jackeline Lozano from Henderson , was awesome , i have fun and was easy , sure I will comeback soon ! ! ! :) :)<->1
Love it . Funky quirky gifty stuff . Healthy yummy smoothie bar and cafe . Quaint and limited natural foods selection + craft beers and wine .<->1
New favorite sandwich shop . Friendly staff , and they 've never gotten my order wrong . Also love the Coca - Cola Freestyle beverage dispenser , with more than 120 drink choices . By far the most sugar free beverage choices I 've seen .<->1
Love this place ! It 's the people from Cheesecake Factory and 24 hours ! And , even though , it 's in the Palazzo , the prices are not that bad . Nuff said !<->1
Cool little spot to study . Open til 2 am , which I LOVE since most coffee shops close around 6 pm Or 9 pm . Yummy drinks & desserts . Cool atmosphere . Wish they had more comfortable seating though .<->1
What a dissapointed visit ! Not anything like it once was . Had better food at truck stop . Way over priced for what you received . Go to other places in this casino , far better .<->0
Absolutely delicious . I loved the sweet and sour pork combo meal . Well worth it .<->1
Holy cow this was good . The chips are fresh and just thick enough . The service is fast and proficient . Really good food and portions .<->1
Great , fresh food . Amazing flavors . After day drinking , this place really hit the spot . Its casual , no frills , but well worth every penny .<->1
The seafood was very fresh , the service was flawless and the ambience could not be more fun . Joso 's has held up over time from all accounts , and I enjoyed myself .<->1
This place is great for takeout or delivery . I order from here often and highly recommend . The food is ready fast and delivery is even faster .<->1

The fusion of traditional Hawaiian favorites were combined in way to make the meal savory . The nostalgic decor with a modern twist is enjoyable .<->1
Trash service . Trash food . Decent beer tho . Do n't get this burnt ass sandwich too , it 's the crispy chicken sandwich . It was so crispy it could tear up your gums , do not recommend .<->0
This Starbucks was clean , well stocked , with friendly service . I 've been receiving poor service at my regular location and now prefer this location ! My drinks are always made properly and taste delicious .<->1
Wow . This hotel meets and exceeds your expectations . Every single staff member was pleasant . Pamela in the Concierge lounge was so pleasant at 6 am . Great hotel .<->1

Decent sushi . Maki were not great , the nigiri and apicy salmon sushi were okay . Service is neither quite slow or fast . Nice and quiet , not too busy at lunch .<->2
Awesome Korean supermarket to visit . Kimchi heaven ! My wife usually has to purchase them red bean cakes in the shape of a fish when we 're there . I love the cashiers . They 're so friendly ! =)<->1
This place was awesome . Delicious Korean BBQ . Succulent meat and some of the best service I 've had in a long long time . Everyone was so sweet and helpful . Definitely worth checking out . Ca n't praise the staff enough .<->1
Seriously , we had reservations for 6:00 pm . We showed up at 6:05 pm and were told our table was given away . Do n't make reservations there since they do n't honor it .<->0
Best bubble smoothie tea . They have so many options ! Yum and the noodle soups are delicious and gluten free !<->1
A fun food experience . We had the table cooked garlic pork with the soybean stew and rice . Everything was tasty . Service was excellent . A great place to go with a group of friends . We 'll be back !<->1

Great food and service .. Everything made to order . Love the carnitas burro ! Both salsa 's are fresh and tasty . Chips are also outstanding ..<->1
This Taco Bell has messed up more of my orders than any of the fast food spots in the area combined .<->0
Pizza amazing ... Employees suck ... Was like 50 people in uniform .. 2 working others chatting ... Manager should have def sent half the staff home earlier and tighten them up ... Get them off their phones ... I do n't blame the kids working but the adult managing whoever that was .<->0
Pasta was great and I do nt like chains ! Service was awesome.great meatballs.love the look of the place .. great job !<->1
Highly recommend the Nobu signature experience . Service is excellent . The signature dishes were outstanding . Both to taste and presentation . Wow !<->1
Good for a dt hk style bistro . Prices are higher than Markham places . But i still come here when I want my fix . I 'm also not willing to walk to the new alternatives in the area<->2
Decent food for bar food . Good service , reasonable price . Come here for football often . Close , convenient , cozy .<->1
Two words : epic music . Sweet edm tunes cranking through the sound system while you chow down on great Korean food . How do you beat that ?<->1
I 've never waited so long for drive through in my life . Get your act together chick fil a ! ! !<->0
Henry the food here Tastes good amazing full of flavor awesome repeatedly coming back . This Cosmopolitan is the spot . Food for the whole package .<->1

This place is incredible . The Duck in a Can and the Foie Gras Tart are truly top notch . Excellent wine list too .<->1
Wow , best buffalo tenders and fried pickles ever . Pickles are thick and coated in cruchy batter . Chicken is thick and real chicken . Do n't pass it up .<->1
Onion rings are to die for but do n't order for 2 must have at least 4 to help you eat them . Burgers are good also . Waitress we had was great & friendly .<->1
Best vegetarian pizza in town - great ingredients , great tasting , love it .<->1
Horrible service on " all you can eat Sushi " . Only got our initial order waited 30 minutes for second order which never came . 1st and last visit .<->0
Ok , so far ... no coronitas for margaritas , no Miller Light on draft ? Service was good , food good .<->2
If you are looking for a true authentic birria this is the place . The birria de chivo ( goat ) was delicious . Made me think of our family Mexican vacations .<->1
Love the ambiance and stuffed mushrooms . My husband and I love to come here for a good Italian meal and great wime selections .<->1
YUM YUM YUM ! Was here for a work happy hour and the service , drinks and small bites were on point ! Ca n't wait to bring my out of town company for a visit !<->1
La bouffe était correcte mais sans plus . Le service était toutefois impeccable . Un peu cher par contre<->2
Excellent for lunch , nice view , food is delicious , price point affordable . Not for vegetarians or vegans . Meet lovers preferably .<->1
Awesome food , good quality toppings , tastes really fresh . The opportunity to build your own pizza is awesome . On top of that they have a gluten free dough options .<->1
Service - Pretty awful . Had to get up and serve myself . Found a hair that 's clear as daylight and the man in the black suit did n't even apologize . Food - Decent , cheap . Understandable why it 's so busy .<->0
Love the patio in the summer , love the inside loungey - vibe for work lunches . Great place , great food . Scary - dangerous entrance steps though ... Edit : Owner was awesomely responsive and I can confirm they have indeed addressed the entrance steps ! Much better . ;)<->1
Foods are not fresh , the service is also ... Especially the old waiter , very rude , upset me<->0
Go for the Happy Hour ! $ 2.00 tap beer and free food . I 'm between successes ( i . e . , unemployed ) and a new fan !<->1
They have fresh bagels and a friendly staff . Too bad they do n't offer a military discount .<->1
These guys r the real deal ! ! Excellent food , great service ! Try the white sauce pizza<->1
Upscale dining , using " Modernist Cuisine " techniques . Food from local sources , perfectly prepared . Impeccable service . Great for special occasions . Pricey , and worth it .<->1
Awww ! I wanted my plate to look like what I saw in the commercial ! lol but I 'm still gon na eat this ! Lol but I guess ihop is ihop so I ca n't complain thank u smooches !<->2
The high chairs and dining area were a bit dirty ... But the food was yummy and the girl at the register was really nice .<->1
Absolutely love the Fez burger and lamb sliders . Service is always great and the ambiance is fresh and hip .<->1
Great place if you do n't want to get served . We 've been waiting at the bar for half an hour and ca n't get a bartender to pay attention . I 'll go to a bar with better service !<->0
I really love this place except for one thing it is a bit expensive for a Chinese place in McCandless . Our last dinner for four people including 2children was over $ 70 . A bit high for us .<->1
I love this place , the sandwiches , soups , and salad are delicious ! We love sitting by the Fire place . My all time favorite salad is the Thai Salad . It 's Fresh and delicious !<->1
Delicious mango desert . Enjoyed lunch with frie nds . Staff is extremely friendly . Great selection of wine .<->1
We finally have it ! Stopped by today and was surprised by how organized and well stocked the grocery is . Fresh fish looks great and the usual filipinon junk food . Love it !<->1
It was nt a very good experience , the burgers were sub - par , definitely not what i was expecting , especially for as long as the line and the wait was ..<->0
Eclectic style of tacos . Go for Taco Tuesdays and you will love all the different assortment of dishes !<->1
Thus place is different then any other place in Vegas . Good dogs , good fries , and a real chill atmosphere .<->1
Saw the cook picking his nose . As he prepared dough and pizza ingredients . Never again ! ! !<->0
The service is so ridicous bad ? the watress says nothing good to us ? because someone has not paid the tips for last meal ?<->0
Excellent ... the garlic edamame was fantastic . Kale salad was a first and I loved it . Everything was so fresh and cooked perfectly .<->1
I love China Café . Delivery Person she was great always has a smile .<->1
Just discovered Grape this past weekend . Had a fantastic meal and the scallops were amazing . Wine and service were equally amazing . Really enjoyed the Jazz band and will be back to Grape very soon .<->1
Awesome food , fantastic service , fair price . Try the green chili mac and cheese for sure .<->1
Salads are hearty and the soups are all good . The cheesesteak sandwich is tasty . Breakfast is worth a stop in . I recommend the waffles and chicken .<->1
Came here the first day of opening . Tried three sauces : curry , butter & garlic and their signature LA boil sauce , all taste excellent ( much better than Captain boils ) . Definitely would come back here again .<->1
I love Cafe Zupas . Everyone does . But bring back the bread ! The good stuff . That new bread is dry , we want that fresh slice loaf back .<->1
The service is fast and accommodating ! I would recommend the Aloe Soju Tini because it 's refreshing and sweet ! Would definitely come back again<->1
Great tacos and salsa . Carnitas , pescado , and goat ... and good salsa and roasted jalapeños .<->1
I got there kinda close to closing the food could have been hotter with that said I would still go back to eat . Soul food that is good is very hard to come by .<->2
Another flawless fantastic meal at SW . Perfect steak , do n't miss the truffled cream corn or the grilled asparagus salad . Wonderful service , great flavors , good wine and delicious cocktails . Really , that 's all I have to say about that .<->1
Went there after CLT Vintage . Really great bartender . Did n't have what I would like to drink but offered substitutions ... always nice . Bartender is Corey . Really nice ! Would absolutely go there again !<->1
Food was great , I do n't see why people complain about the serving sizes . Well at in my opinion the meat portions are pretty big .<->1
Fantastic Quiche Lorraine & Meatloaf Sandwich . Nice little intimate gem in Surprise , AZ .<->1
Perhaps the best steak EVER ! I loved it . The service was spectacular . When I go to Montreal this is one of my go to places !<->1
Fresh fish great service check out johnny behind the sushi bar ... good food good prices<->1
Great bar . Great staff . I continue to go here because of that . The definition of a neighborhood bar .<->1
This is my first time trying this place . Love it . I use do n't care for Asian food , but I will definitely be coming back .<->1
Long waits , slow service , good food . Glad I tried it , but I would n't again wait 1.5 hours for brunch .<->2
Ordered a waffle and two eggs with bacon ( the breakfast special ) sat for 26 minutes waiting for it , when it came it was room temperature and sub par . Bummed because I had high hopes for this place .<->0
First time to this particular restaurant the food was decent the beer was good the service on the day we went was terrible . I 've been to other yard House is how this has been the worst<->1
I know it seems weird to review a CVS but we just love having this place right around the corner . We have gotten to know the employees here and they are all awesome ! Kind , funny , and helpful .<->1
Went for brunch last week . Superb and very friendly service . Generous portions and food was good . I would go again to try burger which is ranked in top 25 in Toronto Life magazine .<->1
Always a great experience ! They 're super quick And the portion size is pretty good . The large definitely ca n't be eaten in one sitting . Not the best Poke bowl I 've had ... but still very good .<->1
I do n't like sushi but I had their uni and scallop it was very tasty ! it would 've been better if the tempura shrimp was hot and fresh<->1
True Italian food , everything made fresh from scratch . Ca n't beat it . First time here and definitely not the last .<->1
Food and service were excellent . The dates appetizer was fantastic . The food had great flavors and just the right amount of spice . It is not inexpensive , but it is a very good meal .<->1
Brought here as a treat for our team holiday and I am already planning multiple repeat trips<->1
We had a wonderful seafood brunch . All the food was fantastic , including the mussels ( 2 types ) , shrimp , thick bacon , pastries , ceviche , omelettes , fruits & so much more . One of the best brunch buffets ever !<->1
Great Thai food . If you do n't get into Byblos ( across the street ) this is good alternative !<->1
Pretty good beer . Ordered the cheese and meat platter for 5 and got food for 2 - 3 , for $ 16 not cool . I would suggest only ordering beer .<->1
I have never had a bad meal here . The Cajun egg Benedict dish is very good . They always have a nice rotating tap list . The service is good and the prices are a bit high .<->1
It was really close from my mom 's house though so .. it was just one of those , " will - do " restaurant :)<->2
The service is impeccable ! Christos was quite attentive & informative . The food was plentiful and delicious . Specials were swordfish steak with lentils and were so good !<->1
Just like how I remembered when I was in Chi . Ca n't ask for better in Vegas . Chopped Salad was good !<->1
Alex needs to learn about customer service ... been ordering from here for years and she has no communication skills or customer service skills . Will not be ordering any more !<->0
Great food and great service . Definitely at the top of the list of Pittsburgh Steak Houses .<->1
Excellent local find as we were passing through . Great food , large menu . worth the stop as you are heading north on 77 .<->1
I 've had two meetings here thus far . Both were pretty cool - I 'll be honest it was a bit pricey but the decor and ambiance more or less justifies the price .<->1
So good . Love that smokey fire oven flavor . Such great toppings . And spotted cow on tap<->1
! Great service and wonderful food ! ! ! My favorite Pizza in Las Vegas ! Very much like the Pizza I grew up with in New York . There Monday special is an added bonus !<->1
Town Center Grocer is just around the corner for me . The prices are pretty decent . They usually have a special on a couple types of beer . The workers are generally friendly .<->2
Make sure to add salt to your pizza , sounds crazy , but it needs it trust me ! Andrea the bar tender is awesome ! !<->1
The atmosphere is nice and is conducive for large dinner parties . The hosts and waitstaff are very friendly and honest . They are even accommodating on splitting entrees , etc . The food also looks great and tastes good .<->1
Awesome ! Will be back ! Had low carb crust with hatch chiles and sausage . And mild wing ... Loved them !<->1
Ate here last Saturday , food was amazing . I 've been a bunch but I thought it was time to leave a nice review . My fav is their Chickhumm . Ca n't go wrong here<->1
Amazing Salmon served over thinly sliced cactus ... Sipping Rutherford Cab Napa Valley listening to Mexican music sitting outside ... Awesome . Life is good ...<->1
I had lunch here . Chef 's choice deserve a try ;) The fillet mignon with onion and mushroom is tasty !<->1
Incredible food and great prices ! They know how to treat their customers .<->1
Was there for a work dinner and we had the entire restaurant . Wait staff were very attentive and food was excellent . Cater well to allergies and dietary restrictions .<->1
Loved this old style Italian restaurant . All four of us loved our dinners . Do n't forget to leave room for canolis and tiramisu .<->1
Sushi was pretty on point , especially their nigiri . Service is quick . Nice atmosphere . Will be back again ! I recommend this place if you 're looking for an AYCE joint<->1
Good alternative to Whole Foods so far we like doing grocery shopping for organic produce .<->1
Duck steamed buns were incredible . Gross fatty and tough . I ca n't believe they were served and we had two orders of them . Pork steamed buns were decent and wings were ok . Everything was overly greasy and lacked flavor . Very disappointed<->0
I love Greekfest . It 's the best Greek food that I have tasted in Phoenix . Everything was very flavorful ! Great portions for the price . I will be back !<->1
Service was awful , long wait times and we did nt receive our drinks for almost 30 minutes !<->0
went here yesterday ... food was great had the french toast and fried chicken with strawberry 's was so yummy great twist on chicken and waffles . Waitress we friendly and service was perfect .<->1
Loud and tendu but I have had better sushi . Not the best place but overall not too bad . I rate it 3 out if 5 stars .<->2
1st time there , food was excellent service was great steamers we awesome so glad we found out about this place<->1
Cappuchino was not very tasty here , far too watery . The shop was very cute and interesting . Seems more like a tourist trap than a high quality coffee kind of place .<->0
Good spot ! Very clean inside . Had the cold vermicelli and the service was fast ! The beef stew is also good . Next time I will try the pho<->1
Shack Shack was good but not worth the $ 10 for the sandwich only . Service was nice and burger was ready quick considering the location . Possible second try in the future .<->2
Food is over priced . Their menu is n't anything to brag about . But for what it costs here .. Go down the road to the Olive Garden and eat well .<->2
Great burger and shake ! Excellent service , they deliver the food right to your table . Very clean and cool atmosphere . Definitely recommended for a quick dinner or lunch for the family .<->1
Excellent barbecue and very reasonable priced . We really enjoyed the ribs . They were tender and very tasty<->1
Good food and good service . Enjoyed it thoroughly during my short stay in Las Vegas . The waitress was very nice as well .<->1
We ordered appetizers , sushi , beef sukiyaki and teriyaki chicken and fried rice . Everything was delicious . Very flavorful . Will come back for sure !<->1
My mom loves Coco 's . So I normally take her every other week . I 've got to admit they have a great selection and very tasty ! Today for lunch I had the Bacon , Arugula , Tomato & Avocado Trio ... So good ! :-)<->1
I really enjoyed my meal . I ordered the rib bones , baked beans and slaw . The service was great and the people who work there are very friendly and helpful . I 'll be back for sure !<->1
The beer was better when Jim was the brew master here . The food is OKAY , but the service is terrible . This place has so much potential - too bad .<->0
Best pizza in The Valley of the Sun ! Thin crunchy crust , fantastic topping choices Nothing but good can be said ... oh wait the check in hostess can be a bit snippy .<->1
Never fails to meet my expectations . Really a nice place to go for the whole family ! space is a little tight but not a big deal . Surrounded by the pretty Mormon temple and a park !<->1
Probably my least favorite restaurant in Charlotte . Usually food is too salty and inconsistent portion sizes . Generally great service , food is just meh<->0
A perfect copy of Robertos . Good food but Robertos was already in the area , a one minute walk from each other . The only thing different with this place is it has a drive thru which is a plus .<->1
Asian fusion restaurant . Beet salad , duck beast taco thing is recommended . Apparently they have this killer nitrogen ice cream , going to try it out next time .<->2
I get the cinnamon French toast with a bunch of fruit on top ! It 's a tad pricey but it 's nice every once in a while .<->1
Good smoked meat but bad service . Seems like in Montreal you have to deal with rude service to eat smoked meat .<->2
Red Thai chicken and rice is the real deal ! ! Get the edamame with truffle oil . So Flippin tasty .<->1
Great food . Love the build your own pasta , my favorite sauce is the marinara ! ! ! Locally owned !<->1
Love the food but the service is terrible at this location . A bunch of kids with an attitude .<->0
This place is great ! ! The food is great and you do n't need a lot of cash . Good stuff !<->1
The service was excellent but unfortunately for me these desserts are way too rich , even for my sweet tooth .<->1
Had lunch there today food was great reminded me of the food at home . Will be eating there again . Thanks for great food . It 's what this valley needs .<->1
Cute and trendy decor . All about the healthy food , but this just feels like another chop shop with flavorless dishes<->0
Perfect in every way ! My favorite is the ' Athenian ! with the thicker crust ! Great tasting pizza . All the kids loved it !<->1
Went here the first weekend they open , amazing service talked to the owner Anthony and made my mothers Birthday dinner a good one . Great salmon , and chicken Parmesan . Will be going more ofter . Pricy though but great quality .<->1
Went on a whim and was highly impressed , the food was excellent . Burger was cooked to my liking along with excellent service . Will be back for their great burgers .<->1
The food was good the price was right the staff was GREAT ! Maddie our server was wonderful ! She was knowledgeable professional and friendly . We would come back just for the great service .<->1
You 've been warned . You 'll want to go back . A lot . Your diet might not appreciate your new habit .<->1
Okay I guess . Just wished they had gluten - free options .<->0
If I can give this place zero stars I would . Lunch was mediocre and tasteless . Not one single item was spiced correctly most of the food did not have any spices at all .<->0
Love coming here with a group of people and trying lots of dishes . Do n't miss the chicken wings for sure ! And fun cocktails .<->1
Nothing special ... decent food , service was good .. but in the sushi bar ... I saw the employee who making the sushi .. , they talk too mush when they was working ... Then we eat the saliva in the sushi ... not too clean ...<->0
Great food with great service . Staff are super friendly and helpful with suggestions on wing sauces and what beer would compliment your order . I just wish they would n't change out their beers on tap so often .<->1
The food is delicious ! ! And the Paloma cocktail is so yummy ! ! ! Highly recommend this new restaurant !<->1
As many have said before me , get the orange chicken . We do n't eat out often , but this is darn delightful when we do .<->1
Insanely good , homemade masterpieces . I 've lived in Middle East and this place does it right .<->1
Service is personable and great ! Food is even better ! Our office will be returning often !<->1
Been here at least 5 times and it 's always good maybe the best pizza in Vegas . Still have to try a few more but 5 - 50 is winning the pizza race .<->1
Love this place ! Just went here and ordered the petite filet and lobster tail , everything is so good here . I also love the pork chop ! My favorite dessert is the lava cake hot and yummy .<->1
Very good service & very fast seating ! ! ! Mel was a exceptional waitress ! ! ! On point on everything ! !<->1
Taco time really impressed me everything was so delicious and fresh and very affordable awesome place<->1
The atmosphere was nice , the inside , patio and bar area was fun but the prices were very high and the food was mediocre at best ... they had a large beer selection but you can almost go anywhere for that .<->0
Great service ! Food is on point .. Flavors are so good . I love this place . Already been back a second time and I will continue to go :)<->1
The sandwich was pretty tasty and filling . It 's definitely worth a late night stop if you 're in Pittsburgh .<->2
Fried chicken is delicious . Service was excellent . Love the decor , for the price .. such a treat from the rest of the restaurants around the strip .<->1
The only good thing they have is their crunchy noodle and egg rolls . Everything else is lacking seasoning , and flavor . Really hoped to finally have found a good chinese place here is AZ but did n't live up to our expectations .<->0
I have been looking for this place ever since I left Chicago 35 years ago ... hands down the best rib joint in Las Vegas , this will be my new home worth the 35 minute drive<->1
Been here two times now . I think the service is good and the establishment is clean but the food is mediocre at best .<->0
$ 3.86 Just came in to buy gas during a spring training trip . Store was nice and clean .<->2
The food is okay . It tastes decent but there is nothing amazing . Service is pretty good . For the most part , it is just overpriced seafood .<->2
Best cupcakes in Las Vegas . 100 times better than the Cupcakery . You can create your own combo of flavors between cake , icing filling and completely customize your cupcakes . Friendly staff . Try them !<->1
One of my favorite late menu establishments . They have the best cilatragon margarita I 've ever had ! Great patio and awesome music . Oh and ca n't forget about the awesome staff , Chip is my favorite !<->1
Passion fruit caramel melts in your mouth ! Bought the pink lemon and the mint chocolate chips . Shianterial is super knowledgeable about the product . I wanted to buy everything ! Thank you jinju for the wonderful experience .<->1
So glad this place is back ! ! Excellent food from vegan to carnivore . Healthy and fresh . We loved it before and we really missed it when it was gone . Vegan burrito , vegan cheesecake , and black bean burger are the best .<->1
Went there today . Service is great . All the staff is very friendly . Food was very good . They make everything to order , so it takes a little longer to get your food . Which I 'm okay with because it 's soooo worth it .<->1
Great area ... nice casino but it seems that not a lot a people come here<->1
Love love love they have a vegan taco on their menu . Thank you ! Nice staff , food comes out quick , and tasted healthy !<->1
Omg love the smoothies they taste so amazing and refreshing . The customer service was awesome<->1
Great service and great eggs Benedict accompanied with a generous fresh bowl of fruit . Very good experience !<->1
This is the ONLY place I know that offers " lunch special prices " on dinner time ( 9:30 pm ) . And GREAT FOOD . Two thumbs UP HK star !<->1
Really good sushi burritos . Would give a 5 Star if they took off that stupid jazz music that they played .<->1
Amazing burgers ! I loved the grindburger . Great salads . You can build your own burgers . Best burger in Cleveland . Forget B - spot this is the place to go<->1
Really good . Had fish n chips . Looked just like the picture ! And tasted better . Friendly host . Clean little spot . We 'll be back .<->1
Amazing ! I went for brunch after being denied at Giada . I 'm so glad I did ! Everything was amazing ... fundido , shrimp tamale , chilliquiles , Bloody Mary . All delicious and the service was outstanding ! Highly recommend ! !<->1
Although the ambience is good but the food was Very disappointing ! Horrible food , disgustingly dirty plates and cutlery ! Would never recommend it ! Paid $ 27 per person for s * * t .<->0
The chunky monkey was good but the orange crepe was terrible . The sweet orange was so over powering .<->0
I can not , for the life of me , figure out how this place is popular . Sub par service and pasta and it 's gross inside .<->0
Best Mexican food by far anywhere in the Vegas valley ! Always great service and great food !<->1
hey fate . you were better when you were that hole in the wall on university called lucky dragon.boo.nastiest food ever .<->0
This particular building has been so many different restaurants and I 'm really glad that La Mojarra Loca Grill looks like it will be here for years to come ! Great staff and food !<->1
Definitely worth a visit . Delicious italian food and good ambience . Not too crowded , at least when we visited .<->1
Staff was awesome and friendly . Has the chicken ranch on a wheat wrap . The broccoli salad was amazing . Had a slice of home made pineapple cake . Definitely want to check this little gem out its awesome .<->1
Now I live in Philly and I want burnt ends for dinner tonight and I ca n't have them and it makes me want to cry . Black Dog , I love you .<->1

Friendly staff , great bar selection & awesome food . Prices are more then reasonable . Locals , discover this gem !<->1
its the typical unhealthy Chinese food that everyone loves . prices are nt bad but it coulb be a tad bit cheaper<->1
Thought I 'd put this review in to balance the 1 star reviews . Service was fine , although they missed 1 item . Food was great . Maybe overpriced , but great location .<->2
This is a great lunch spot . Healthy , quick , beautiful food . Great selection for all lifestyles - vegan , vegetarian , meat eater , paleo - choices for everyone !<->1
Absolutely love this place . I 've had burgers and salads both were very tasty . The beer selection is wonderful , service is prompt and the atmosphere perfect . Also dog friendly ! Great for lunch or dinner .<->1
We ate here two times this weekend . Sat at the bar both times and had a good experience . Highly recommend the cheese & meat appetizer . Lasagna was good . Staff was friendly and helpful .<->1
Had a fantastic lunch . Fantastic service and great company . It was a wonderful way to end a long week .<->1
AWESOME GF Vegetarian / Vegan food tucked away in the Walnut shopping block in Shadyside . Friendly staff , generous portions , casual atmosphere . Fantastic brunch ! A must try for all .<->1
Absolutely delicious with high quality ingredients and , for a casual restaurant , a cool vibe . Our waiter could n't have been nicer or more knowledgeable . This is a great , inexpensive restaurant with wonderful food .<->1
I love a place where I can get a tasty , filling salad and my husband can get a gut bomb hot dog . We 're both happy . The milkshakes are also amazing ! I love the pumpkin pie shake .<->1
Linda was a great server ! So happy we lucked up with her :) she made the experience very pleasant .<->1
My Boss recommended this place if I was ever in Pheonix and it did not disappoint . The Food was excellent ! ! ! Colette & Gabriels service was top notch , wish they were in Hawaii ! ! !<->1
Great food , excellent service . Small seating inside but additional outdoor seating is a huge plus . Easy parking as it 's located inside The District .<->1
I really enjoy their takeout bento boxes . It comes with so much food it takes me two days to finish .<->1
A fast food place that tastes better than most cafes . The staff is friendly , but mostly only speaks French . Their poutine is also really good in the early mornings !<->1
Excellent service and food . Staff in great mood and takes good care of their customers .<->1
I unfortunately had the worst customer service experience here . She was rude , pushy , and ruined my whole donut experience . So very disappointed .<->0
Staff is very friendly and always willing to help . Love the Portuguese product they carry , makes me feel at home . Good job :) !<->1
I love sushi ! ! It was my first time at this Sushi Restaurant . Food was OK . Nothing really stood out but I have to admit their portions for AYCE was pretty generous and the price was decent for the overall experience .<->2
Best burger , ask for the f burger ia not in the menu . Do n't forget the onion rings and the truffle fries<->1
Great food and on time . I ordered food to go . Life got busy and I was 30 minutes late picking it up . It was warm , not hot , but that was my fault and it was still delicious .<->1
I like to keep things simple : - Good atmosphere , a little cozy but still pleasant - Good service - Good foodA nice place to go in the east end<->2
Awesome lunch special for $ 7.99 . Three choices of meat and veggies with Ethiopian bread . The portion was really big , and we could not even finish it .<->1
A frosty mug of draft root beer really hits the spot . Also the best root beer float around . Burgers and fries are also pretty good by fast food standards .<->1
Wonderful food and service . I sat at the bar and Sergio , the awesome bartender , took really good care of me . The street sandwich and papas fritas are excellent . Salt air margaritas are good too ! Will definitely come again . Great ambience .<->1
5 + Stars for Tyler . Great Dining Experience Very generous portions and excellent flavor . I recommend the zucchini - chicken parm with alfredo<->1
Always friendly service and great food . Ca n't go wrong at this location . Nice modern decor inside as well .<->1
A great place ... trust me try one now thank me later . The Hazel Nut / Dark chocolate is to die for<->1
the Best spicy checken on Bloor . if add Cheese on it ? Mmm Yummy ! Fantastic Ensemble ! ! Do n't forget the Free Desert , it is my favorite part .<->1
I really wanted to like this place but the food was overly greasy , the meat was tough and the depth of flavor just was n't there for Thai food .<->0
Love this place never disappoints always amazing ! ! The food is always fresh and amazing ! Service Is great and always friendly ! ! We come out of our way to come here best Chinese food around<->1
Horrible Food extra grease and non melted cheese<->0
Probably the best south indian food ( veg ) you can get in North Charlotte . Service is wonderful<->1
Peut - être parce que j'y étais un midi , alors qu'on m'avait vivement conseillé d'y aller le soir , en débutant par leur 5 à 7.Bon mais pas transcendant . Je m'attendais à un peu plus d'exotismePar contre , très bon thé !<->2
Warm and magical little cafe minutes away from Yonge & Finch . Delicious puffs with great variety and presentation . Friendly and upbeat staffs here . Would definitely recommend for a casual date .<->1
This place is super super good . The sandwiches are delicious and the bruschetta are extremely good but can be inconsistent sometimes .<->1
Amazing pizza ! ! Always fast and always yummy . Great location and love that they always have sports playing ! Wonderful staff !<->1
Best Doughnuts ever ... I love the Strawberry Shortcake ! ! ! Open 24 hours ... make sure to call ahead and pre order the Cronuts ... If the doughnut you want is not available they may be able to make it fresh ... just ask ! !<->1
Amazing drinks and awesome atmosphere ! Very creative menu and selection of drinks ! Irene and all the workers are extremely friendly and make you feel right at home !<->1
Really great iced mocha and amazing toast . The owner is very friendly and a really cool spot .<->1
Worst pho I 've ever had . The soup was room temperature and it did n't have much flavour as well .<->0
LOVE IT ! MY FAVE IS THE Full Montagu ... perfect place to grab a bite after crazy night of drinking ... Definitely making this a regular stop when in Vegas . = ]<->1
In my top 3 of buffets ! I wish I could have stayed for hours for their brunch ! Gourmet everything !<->1
P - Nut Butter Jelly Burger w / Pretzel Bun . Do n't forget to get the sweet potato tater tots .<->1
A little pricey but the food was good and the staff was very attentive . The atmosphere was nice and it 's bigger than it looks from the outside . Will stop here again<->1
I enjoy Bar Smith the music , the balcony and it always ends in a fun night . Beware the cover sucks and drinks are pricey .<->1
Jon , Tess , Charlie , Erin , Kathleen and whole gang are the best ! ! !<->1
I enjoyed the Seared whitefish , shrimp and wild rice dumplings , sauteed baby bok choy , shiitake mushrooms and sherry cream sauce . They provide a small carafe of water on the table .<->1
Dole Whip . Mango / Pineapple blend . I am in love . Ca n't get enough . Also the Nutella Brownie was a great choice<->1
Amazing food ! So happy to have a Puerto Rican restaurant so close . . the chicharrons were on the money , perfect place . Will be back for more !<->1
3 stars , friends loved the pizza . Every piece I picked up fell right apart . It 's okay .<->2
The Thai bubble tea is awesome and the pho is delicious . The workers are nice . Excellent experience .<->1
I love ramen and ramen for $ 7 is awesome in my books . It 's fast to get the food , fast to eat , tasty , delicious and cheap . I highly recommend the pork bone soup .<->1
What a great place to have a great breakfast or lunch . Just love the atmosphere and Jordan Jewett is an awesome waitress .<->1
I 've only ordered sushi to go from Sushi Bomb , but the sushi was fresh and very good . They made my order quickly and the prices are reasonable .<->1
Service was ok . steamed rice was very dry . Mongolian beef had a good taste . Mushu chicken was very bland and had to ask for plum sauce to be able to eat it . Would not recommend .<->0
So , since this review I was contacted by the owner apologizing for the experience , I 've been back since and enjoyed my time . Sincerely hoping that the berating of people is over with . The food is really good .<->1
Delicious food , and a beautiful presentation . I had something that was called ginger chicken I think . Sorry , I ca n't remember but it was amazing ! And the brown rice with some of the best race I 've ever had .<->1
Loved sitting outside . The service was great . The food is good too . A good restaurant in Mississauga for a special night out !<->1
I love the panko steamed bao and the kimchi fries . I usually order through Ritual and it 's always been fast , cheap and delicious .<->1
The doughnuts rock almost as much as the staff . Check out the pumpkin spice now that it is back in season .<->1
Pleasantly surprised when they sat us fairly quick for Sunday brunch . Food took a bit too long in my opinion but it WAS busy . Our server was good at making us feel attended to despite the long wait .<->0
Liver Mush - DO IT ! I love the music . I love the atmosphere . Brunch is the business . Great service . I love to eat here . It 's a good way to brighten the day .<->1
Dishes ordered were worth the price . Restaurant is clean and inviting . Service is just okay .<->2
This is a little gem . Great food and a welcoming staff . Ordered five entrees and all were fantastic !<->1
Love it ! ! ! Will definitely be back . Greeeeat sushi . Ramen not so much . Go to Chinatown for good ramen and less pricey . Great atmosphere . Eclectic .<->1
Seabass and Gulf Shrimp with tomato - saffron broth was pretty good . Gulf shrimp yummy , but could have undercooked the seabass a little more . Vibrant crowd , okay service<->1
Staff was polite , the location was clean , food was phenomenal . My husband 's compliant is " it wss too hot and the enchilada sauce had to much cinnamon " . I deffanitly liked it better than my hubby did .<->1
Excellent menu all - around : usually very good arepas , and the patacon pisao is a must . Quick takeout times and not one but two outdoor seating areas . Appetizers / sides all worth it . Both locations offer the same quality .<->1
Excellent food & service ! ! ! A first class establishment ! ! ! I could eat here every day & I do n't think I would ever get tired of it ! ! !<->1
Average sprouts . Great organic stuff , not the cheapest but fair pricing . Good staff for the most part in my experience .<->1
Priced right , GREAT food , everything is fresh , and homemade ! Do n't miss the opportunity to get some hometown southern quality food !<->1
Everyone needs to get ice cream here . I 've had the cinnamon , pistachio , 5 spice honey , peanut butter , and salted caramel , and chocolate . Not necessarily in 1 trip , or more than 2 trips . All were amazing .<->1
Had an awesome meal at crush . All dishes were great especially the gnocchi , scallops and the imported beer ! Definitely be back ! Oh and the girls loved the swing at the front !<->1
Great place to go eat really great authentic Mexican food . This is my first time eating in this place while staying at las vegas for 4th of July and I love it .<->1
If you are looking for a retro dive with huge portions , you must check out this place . The omlets are so big it turns one meal into two<->1
15 - 20 years ago this place was awesome I went there recently for breakfast and ordered Eggs Benedict and was very very disappointed the hollandaise sauce was not prepared correctly I have not been back since<->0
Yes , this is the GTA 's best pastrami spot . The waitresses are charming and informative . ' 70 ' s diner vibes inside but what really matters is that sandwich . The selection of mustards is a bonus . You ca n't be disappointed .<->1
Chewy / crispy thin crust , good sauce , appropriate amount of cheese ( unlike most Pittsburgh pizza ) . Definitely will be back !<->1
This is the place to go for good food and reasonable prices . The tab for 7 including beer and wine for some was $ 120 ! Two people had steak and shrimp too .<->1
Food is ok . Service is lacking . Up to you if you go , but far better places to go for a far better meal for equal or more inexpensive prices .<->0
Wonderful coffee shop that I 'm making my regular work spot . The music was calm , the staff friendly , the cup of joe made just right , the seating comfortable , the space well lit , and the wifi swift .<->1
The employees were so nice , I really felt like they cared a lot about making sure I was happy with my meal . They were also very knowledgable about which products were vegetarian , which was helpful to me , personally .<->1
Two slices of cheese pizza 8 bucks . Luke warm and tasteless . Owner needs to instill value with a drink salad combo for 8 bucks .<->0
How this place has these reviews is beyond me . It 's a small bar . No character . Food was terrible , the kind of nachos I 'd expect to get in Poland . Awful . Avoid .<->0
Great burgers and beer ! I have been coming here for 10 years and they never dispoint ! The service is great and the atmosphere is better . Great looking help and a great place to watch a game .<->1
This place is very over priced and no AC not my idea of eating comfortable . The service was good but I was a bit more concerned about sweating my butt off .<->0
The brunch here was everything I hoped it could be . I 'm talking fresh beignets with dip sauces , delicate quiche , fantastic french fries . Even the baguettes were just perfect . This will become a standard Vegas brunch destination .<->1
Best Mussels . Best Lemonade . Quiet , Relaxing . Good . Would Highly Recommend .<->1
We came here to celebrate my birthday ! The food was great and our server was A - 1 . I will be sure to go back the next time we are in Vegas .<->1
Have gone to happy hour here several times and have to say that the bar staff and food are excellent . The fresh mozzarella is made to order at your table and definitely wortwhile .<->1
Excellent service .. a good value in Vegas for a high end SteakHouse . No complaints . $ 200 for 2 dinners with a couple drinks as expected .<->1
They got their system down . They get you in and out quickly . The staff is always friendly . Now I want coffee ... LOL<->1
This place is my wife 's new love . The pear cobbler is a worth the visit<->1
The custom cupcakes were a hit ! Thank you so much for doing such a great job , on top of being cute , the cupcakes were SCRUMPTIOUS ! :)<->1
What they show you on TV is totally different when you get inside there , it 's your classic bait and switch it 's a con game I 'll never go there again to get anything ! ! !<->0
Great food ... one of the best burgers in Charlotte . Spuds are good and a very generous portion . Will be back !<->1
Food was ok . Was not so excited about it . I ordered multiple dishes for take out and they were good but not something that I will return to .<->2
Horrible wait times in drive thru . Been there 3 times and had to pull around and wait every time . Always out of orange chicken and service is crap . Use dysart and McDowell way better .<->0
Everything on the menu looks so good . I chose the steak and blu grilled bao with side of Thai basil chips . So amazing . Ca n't say enough good things about this place . Fast service , amazing food and friendly staff .<->1
We came after 3 pm on sat . The food is just OK . But the service is awful . The food was served after one hour and twenty minutes ! ! ! The place was almost empty . No way I will come here again<->0
Meat quality was good . Had lamb curry with rice . Did take out . Curry was watery . Asked for spicy was not spicy at all . Seasoning was ok . Gave three stars as service was not bad either .<->2
Healthy , fast , fresh and friendly owners . Lunch was affordable and delicious . Will definitely return .<->1
Best Americano in the city , indisputably I think . Not much seating other than a 4 top with stools and a couple benches but you 're not there to work anyway .<->1
Great pizza ! ! The ingredients tasted really fresh on the pizza . Also got the green salad and it was delicious , house made dressing was a plus !<->1
Burnt tasting and expensive for small burgers . I 've had better burgers at a gas station . Normally they are pretty good but not this time . Looks like it 's back to 5 Guys .<->0
I have made 3 Spring Training trips from Austin , TX and this is by far the best Mexican food I have ever had . The tamales are on point . Salsa is fresh . Pozole is on point .<->1
The 2 * is for the coffee . I like the old school coffee beans and unfortunately , Café Sfouf brews the fruity kind . The ambiance is quite hipster and they seem to also serve vegan food .<->0
After 5 Month in Germany Got back to Vegas . I took few of my friend at Roma deli for dinner . excellent like always great food and our waiter . Thank you Fausto we will be back<->1
The food was amazing , the service was over the top . Our waiter was down to earth and very friendly . I could not even finish my food I was sooo full !<->1
ANY JJ location , Corporate or Franchise , that refuses my request for Hot Peppers , on the side , will ... see me do an about - face , and watch MY BUNS walk out the door ..<->0
It was a great fresh bagels that I every taste they have different cream cheeses . my husband had a sandwich of ham and cheese he love it they make bagel fresh everyday<->1
Fantastic . Great on a Sunday at noon and even better on a Friday at 2 am . The bloody mary tastes clean , flavorful , and awesome , the biscuits and gravy are savory delicious , and the gluten free pancakes taste surprisingly glutenous .<->1
Awesome food , great service . Large portions . Possibly one of the better joints in Venetian<->1
Decent Taiwanese food , we ordered the eggplant with garlic sauce and shredded pork with dried bean curd . The staff are friendly and attentive .<->1
Good place for sweets ! Good service ! Good chicken biryani . Check this new place out . Also close to the Indian grocery and woodmans .<->1
Amazing ! ! ! If I could eat here everyday i definitely would ! The best vegan tacos I 've ever had ! !<->1
The Pad Thai tastes the way it should , not too sweet , really authentic . Great choice for Thai food !<->1
Best pizza in Westlake , not the cheapest but worth the extra $ .<->1
Man oh man ... the food was amazing , the ambiance was amazing , and the cost was not at all expensive ! This is a most DEFINITE place to eat if you are traveling here ! U wo n't regret it ;) ur welcome !<->1
First time here . Our food was really good and service was excellent . Highly recommend Ohjah . We will back here soon .<->1
great service ! Had lunch their and was absolutely amazing . The service was fast and they all worked together . I 'm here for training trip with about 30 other swimmers from Rochester , NY . Loved this DQ ! !<->1
This place has the most delicious treats , the best part is it 's less than 5 minutes from my work !<->1
Service was good but coffee not so great . I ordered a tall almond milk latte and it tastes like burnt coffee . Kind of a bummer :-/ I had high hopes . Not worth the drive or $ 4 .<->2
Service is usually fast food is great and i can never get enough of there drinks there 's so many choices that i get blown away everytime .<->1
I will say this . The pizza is good . HOWEVER ... the delivery staff was terrible and wrote something offensive on the order ticket . I will NEVER recommend them due to that nor order from them again .<->0
Their burgers are OK ! Not the best I 've ever had but they certainly look good :)<->2
Shame on Zipps for opposing a new Z Tejas at Bethany Home and 16th St , Afraid of a little competition .<->0
What you have read about this wonderful barbecue joint is true I 'm so much more Just remember you must get here by Ken have to see the full menu<->1
Great food , drinks and happy hour . Really nice place to grab a drink and catch a game . Their wings and nacho apps are great<->1
This place is nothing special but they do an ok job with the basics . The place is huge and has a fair amount of tv 's nd a decent sized bar .<->2
Great food , Real Thai Food taste , Excellent Services , Perfect Recommendation from the Staff and clear explication about the food options ... Everything Delicious , the Food and the Tea . I will come back anytime .<->1
Friendly staff and remembers their customers . The manager rocks and has great customer service skills . The bagels are always fresh .<->1
This restaurant is so clean and the people who work here are so pleasant . They have the best Cuban food in Las Vegas in my opinion and I am a Porto 's lover . Live music and full bar ! ! !<->1
Ambiance de folie ! J'adore le style original ! A faire sur Montréal en groupe ou couple !<->1
Ordered from skip the dishes to give them a try . Waste of money . Wouldn ' t give this to my dogs .<->0
These cakes are not just beautiful , they 're delicious too ! Sue is so wonderful and very professional ! ! !<->1
Great tacos and really cool scene ! I travel to TX a lot , and thought these tacos were just as good ( if not better ) than what I seek out when I 'm there .<->1
FYI : We went there last month , May , 2017 . East Side Pizza is gone ! Changed into a pizza & wings place . Pizza not as good as East Side . Should have kept the recipe .<->0
Best baked breads I have ever had . Great customer service . Chocolate chip scones are yummy .<->1
Excellent pizza ! Make sure you get Kimmy as your waitress . She is very helpful and attentive . Probably one of the best waitresses we 've had . We had a group of 6 , ordered a lot of food and she got it right .<->1
Fish tacos are AMAZING , order 2 with an ice cold Longboard and you 've found the perfect combo for a hot afternoon !<->1
Fast , fresh , tasty , and good prices ... how can you go wrong ? ! ! Love this place for quick lunch bite or weekend stop !<->1
Took he 6 pm ferry and went for a walk on the island . Got hungry and found this gem . Very nice place to have dinner with a glassof wine . Took the 10:30 ferry back .<->1
We usually try to eat here whenever we visit from SoCal . I always get the spicy noodles ( vegetarian ) , it is not on the menu , but they will make it and they never disappoint . Beware , their 5 is pretty spicy !<->1
Such a great healthy place to shop for dinner ! ! They had fresh Red Snapper from the NC coast , organic potatoes & veggies they grow ! So much fun to see their selections of healthy choices ! Love this place !<->1
I 'm bumping up to 4.5 stars for the availability of ground ghost chilis ... my mouth is watering as I type this . Nom !<->1
Oh my gosh . The Chicken Masala Sandwich is awesome . Started with a bowl of Cream of Asparagus Soup .<->1
This place is a hidden gem ! ! The pastries are amazing and not too sweet , just right . The coffee is amazing ! Definitly beats startbucks , try the iced coffee ! ! I would rate this place 10 out of 10 stars if I could .<->1
After being at a selection of other airports Pgh airport is very organized . They do a good job keeping everyone moving .<->1
Thx Anthony for such a great experience , ur stuff is great and very friendly ;) tonight the Rib Eye was outstanding ;) thx one more time !<->1
Great casual fare , nice atmosphere , amazing tequila selection . We were able to eat outside on the patio , which was fabulous . Would recommend this restaurant to friends .<->1
Great service ... had a birthday party and they were very accommodating ! Happy hour 3 - 6 pm . Food is excellent ... order duck tacos tapas !<->1
I like this place . I heard it was under new ownership , came here while in town to see it is was still as good . It is . I recommend you give it a try , good food and friendly service .<->1
I 'm so glad there 's a ramen spot in the NW ! Their spicy creamy tonkatsu ramen was tasty .<->1
I 'm from the east coast and this is the only place I go . The food is good , the service and speed is great ... ca n't beat it !<->1
Had dinner there with friends on Saturday April 29 , fantastic service and fabulous food . This was highly recommended by a friend and was not disappointing at all . When in Vegas may return again .<->1
I was just telling my friend how CLEAN the store is and how FRESH their fruit is . It 's my new fav Fro Yo spot in the City .<->1
It 's clean and the shakes are good . This one specifically I 'm not keen on the customer service .<->2
Oh . My . God . This place was so delicious . Go . Just Go .<->1
Very disappointing ! Service was poor , at best . Server did not come to take order for 10 minutes ! Food quality was poor ! Example : Avocado toast , stale bread , watery heavily salted avocado !<->0
Overpriced , but still awesome . This location has a beer patio ! You can get your parking fee validated , but it 's a pain in the ass . Clean , and hardworking staff . I would go back for sure .<->2
I love this place , the service is always great and the food it 's amazing . I totally recommend the pozole which is my favorite thing here .<->1
sucks they do nt do abodo omelets , but they have the BEST adobo fried rice . we will definitely be back<->1
A really nice atmosphere . Aria is a very beautiful hotel . Loved the food , especially the Indian food . The prime rib and snow crab we 're also excellent . I liked the fact that it was n't over crowded .<->1
You ca n't go wrong at MRI . Best home cooked food period , beside Bellisario 's . This place is GOOD ! I do n't care what night it is , get the special and you wo n't be sorry ! ! !<->1
Amazing dinner . More variety on the menu would n't hurt though .<->1
Love me sum sweetie 's and its fun too look ...<->1
The food is just fine , but it 's the service and the phenomenal back patio that make this place shine !<->1
Right bye the Pallazzo and Venetian . Great place to buy a last minute holiday card , a bottle , or a bag of chips .<->1
Awesome food ! ! Awesome service ! ! ! Brought the co - workers here and they wished I had told them about this place long ago .<->1
Great diner food , reliable daily specials , great staff and no rush atmosphere make Jimmie 's the place to eat in Mint Hill . Closed Mondays .<->1
Excellent food great staff and management . Its barely more than macdonalds , especially for 11 $<->1
Lots to choose from , clean , garage door front that is opened when the weather is nice . What more could you ask for ? :-)<->1
This place is horrible . Very rude customer service . Gross sugary frosting and dry tasteless cakes .. Worst customer service I ever experienced ! The women behind the counter was so rude and unhelpful . I regret buying for this place .<->0
The hot brewed coffee is weak like gas station coffee . It tastes cheap . The service is good . I will try again but they need improve the brewed coffee .<->0
My friend and I had excellent service from the entire crew today ! Travis and his manager were terrific ! Thank you for singing Happy Birthday too :)<->1
Best mesquite grilled chicken in the Valley ! Loyal customer for 28 years . Family owned , no frills , and oh ... did I mention the beans ? Amazing !<->1
We had two bowls of ramen ( veggie and tonkotsu ) and takoyaki , all three were delicious ! Also , their music taste is excellent ! :) The decor is modern , simple and clean .<->1
Hands down best pizza I 've ever had ! ! So yummy ! I got the lasagna pizza and Caprese salad .. Packed full of flavor ! ! Friendly staff also .. Definitely the new spot ! Love love love ! !<->1
Everything I ordered was freshly made . Guacamole is excellent . I will be coming back for sure<->1
Las Vegas was always a struggle to find good espresso - until now . Fantastic quality , at the typically inflated LV prices .<->1
They are so nice and really do care about taking care of their guests . Wonderful customer service . I was n't the biggest fan on the food but it was n't bad either .<->2
This place is awesome ! Located at the strip right under the Eiffel tower , cool atmosphere great food , great service the food arrived very fast and it was very good . I really enjoyed the experience .<->1
The sandwiches are delicious and different . Love the Humbolt and the Griefo sanwiches . They have good options for vegetarians as well . It gets crowded fast during meal times .<->1
What an amazing meal and experience . Food was excellent meat was very tender staffs are nice and friendly . all the side dish was good all my family was so happy after the meal<->1
Best Chinese restaurant ever ! ! ! I ordered the house fried rice and it was on point I found my new Chinese restaurant to come eat I was satisfied with the food<->1
Moooooo gats burger was amazing ! Had the poutine as well , incredible ! What an experience .<->1
menu has nice variety for those who like to eat heart healthy . Happy selections are tasty . Friendly staff and very professional . Worth a visit ...<->1
Great pizza , great prices . Only minor complaint is that they will tell you 20 min for a pick up pizza , and always ends up being 35 - 40 min . But it 's worth the wait .<->1
The quality of the pizza is very good for its price . Good attendance , we could choose four different flavours for a large pizza , but as we wanted 2 , they made a discount . Very nice from them ! ! !<->1
The chocolate items are more overly sweet than dark chocolate tasting , even though they are dark in color . I 'm a chocoholic , been a couple times , but just sweet over real chocolate taste . It 's a popular themed place for showers though .<->0
Food is average . I was expecting the crepes to be good but , nope . They used preserved strawberries and banana . It 's kinda gooey . Not really complaining coz we got it for free from our timeshare . Probably wo n't visit it again .<->2
Hands down the best pork belly bao in Las Vegas ! ! ! The Won Ton Soup also a winner ... add noodles for $ 2 more . Another champion dish is the sesame noodles ... add pork belly ! ! ! Love this place ! ! !<->1
Best pizza , awesome staff and quick service ! Great lunch stop too , you can get a slice and salad to go in under 5 minutes ! Delish !<->1
Excellent service , great food . Big selection for wine , they also give us 2 muffins after dinner . Interesting experience for tasting aged steak .<->1
Decent craft beers . Food menu is n't very appealing and the items are snack - like . Very large space , excellent for groups . They only take debit or cash as payment .<->1
You have got to check this place out if you have never been . Lots of cheap stuff and the mango drinks are the best .<->1
Very tasty , fresh food . The guy working there kept suggesting different things and I just went it . The toast with cashew cream cheese and pickled onions was a solid choice . I also downed a smoothie while waiting .<->1
Our first time here , we decided to stop and have dinner here before heading to the illumination light show and it was delicious ! ! Definitely will come back again . The food was fresh and very tasty and all American ! ! !<->1
Such a cute store and restaurant . The food is beyond fabulous . Amazing sodas and ice cream too . :) We love this place .<->1
I love this place ! And the bartender Kendall is the bestest ever ! ! !<->1
If you want to run to the restroom all night , then this is the place for you !<->0
Sorry to say , was disappointed . The standard chili cheese dog was ok , nothing special . I 'm a bit of a chili dog nut and was hoping for greatness .<->0
Stellar muffins , great service , excellent " country benny " , lots of fresh coffee . Wait time is worth it .<->1
Quick service , amazing coffee , nice vibe .<->1
Seriously amazing ! The coconut ice cream was made from coconut milk that was awesome . The kids enjoyed the board games .<->1
Everything was delicious , my boyfriend ordered both chicken and cauliflower tacos and said the veggie one was even better than the meat one ! Ice cream sandwich to die for .<->1
I appreciate the bartenders and all the waitstaff . The environment is fun , lots of sports , great music and enjoy hanging with friends from the neighborhood ! .. THE BEST TACO TUESDAY , EVER !<->1
Excellent food , excellent service and the best happy hour -- glass of wine for $ 4 ! I highly recommend the burrata tortelloni . Delicious ! Everything was so good we ate there twice while in Scottsdale for only 4 nights . Do n't miss it !<->1
Was known as Amelio 's . Business has closed his door for a few time and reopened<->0
Love this place ! ! ! So much fun ! ! ! We went to the drag brunch with my friends and we had an amazing time we loved the show , they had a buffet and open bar ! We had a blast !<->1
We went here based on a random recommendation . The chips and salsa were very good . The food is quite hot .<->2
Nice environment , lots of tv 's and super friendly staff . Food needed seasoning but overall ok<->1
Chicken is great but who eats chicken strips without ranch ? Seriously canes , put ranch on the menu .<->1
Excellent food and great service . We 're really glad we found this place . Tacos were very good and breakfast burrito was excellent .<->1
I like this restaurant . Everything tastes good and authentic . They can cater to big parties as well so bring the whole family ! :)<->1
Very good food . Cute dining area made to look like your sitting on a porch near the bayou while listening to Cajun music . Service was great as well , answered all our questions and was very polite . We will come back !<->1
Food has been amazing everytime . Ignore the salthy review , food is bursting with flavours . Staff and owners really friendly . Not expensive , and always get your money worth<->1
I 'm not gon na write much about this place . Literally everything I 've eaten has been absolutely perfect , even things I typically hate . You wo n't find better sushi than this anywhere near Vegas . The strawberry cake dessert is amazing too btw<->1
I tried their chocolate cupcake with buttercream frosting and loved the cake but not the topping . I will certainly return though to try their other goodies !<->2
This is my first time trying Maskadores , I got a Shrimp Burrito delivered and OMG ! ! So delicious ! ! I 'll definitely be back !<->1
This place is empty inside . They do not have the apple donut that I wanted to try so bought boston cream and crounot instead . Their donuts selection are ok .<->2
The food was good . I ordered the egg foo young , and the the gravy was delicious . My only complaint ; I specifically asked for a bunch of sweet and sour and got a tiny cup .<->1
Food : What can I say this place is Amazing ! ! ! Service : Was number one , my glass was never empty . Ordered : Spanakopita , Tzatziki Dip , Chicken , Pork sausage , I was completely full by the end of all that .<->1
Regular food and service nothing much to rave about . But it 's close to everything and comes out pretty fast !<->2
Great atomosphere and a very kind waitress . Fantastic tasty burgers and great tater tots . The only downside was that the truffle fries were too salty .<->1
To be initiated into Pittsburgh , you have to go to Primanti 's . Sandwiches are a tradition and are the best anywhere . You either have to go to the Market Square location or the Strip location ...<->1
I had to reinstall Yelp just to review this place . Simple health conscious delicious food and craft beer really made our Vegas trip pre - clubbing dinner complete . Check this place out !<->1
Today was my first visit to La Grande Orange , and it was wonderful . Seriously some of the best food to the most friendly and helpful staff . I had a great time , and forsee being this a usual dining spot now .<->1
I went to Goldie 's and I said , " Let there be Hot Sicilian Focaccia " and there was Hot Sicilian Focaccia . I saw that the Hot Sicilian Focaccia was good , and ate it .<->1
$ 20 minimum order . Did n't even get to place my order since my total would have only been about $ 10 since it 's just me . Maybe next time when I have the whole family home we will try to go there !<->2
Food was ok maybe would have been better if I could actually eat it instead of swating all the flies away<->0
Absolutely love Winking Lizard . Everything about it is great , the food , the atmosphere , the workers . You ca nt go wrong here . I highly recommend their pizza or wings .<->1
Bagels are amazing ! ! ! I 've recommended this deli to all my friends who want authentic bagels .<->1
Great Food , Great Service , Great Ambiance . Friendly Staff . Well worth a visit . Best Thai food in Arizona .<->1
Parking is horrible , one of the neighbor homeowners decided that it was his job to give everyone a piece of his mind . Food was okay but service was slow and uncaring . I wo n't be going back .<->2
The food is pretty good , but the service is unreasonably slow . We 've stopped coming here before movies / concerts because we 're guaranteed to be late as a result of the slow service . Though the service is slow , it is friendly .<->0
My friend took me here for my B.Day I had there sampler , it was really good . The only thing I did nt like was that there was nt really anything to eat when you start to get the drunk munchies .<->1
First time here . The menu items are great and the staff friendly . It 's a small diner feel very humble and friendly . They say they have big portions here . Bring your appetite<->2
I LIKE THIS PLACE ... nice for ladies lunch but menu begins to bore you if you go very often . Cute design concept . But lacks new excitement . Needs up do & pep talk !<->0
One of my favourite Italian restaurants ! Love the crispy polenta tots as a starter , definitely have to try if you 're planning on eating there . Never disappointed with the food I order , the only thing disappointing is the service .<->1
Awesome coffee shop . The staff is friendly , the coffee is amazing and the atmosphere is unique . I love stopping here when I visit Pittsburgh .<->1
First timer , it is in the top 1 % and they offer samples of the soups . The cost is okay particularly if you split a sandwich . $ $<->1
A great place to eat ! Love the service , ambiance , and food ! Especially the DESSERTS ! ! Ate here for brunch with my husband and had a great experience ! Will be back soon !<->1
We ca n't get enough of this local Italian gem . Every dish reminds of us Italy and tastes like the best dishes Mama made . Do n't leave here without trying the Salmon , Eggplant Parmesan , Chicken Piccata , or Zucca de Pesce .<->1
If you wanna wait for 25 mins at a drive thru ... YES 25 mins for a kids meal cheeseburger . Take a trip to the Jack In the Box on Tatum . What a nightmare ! ! ! Even crazier ... I actually waited .<->0
Very good espresso - based beverages . At 4 pm , their pastries are still fresh - tasting . I had a coffee - flavour eclair as suggested by the barista - I 'm happy I took her suggestion ! Modest , comfortable , quaint . I will go back again :)<->1
Good Chinese food . It was ready to pick up within 20 minutes . General Tso 's Chicken , Szechwan Chicken , and some Won Ton Soup . All were good . Certainly not fine dining , but better than the average Chinese takeout<->1
Good times with my friend Jeannie .. i think we stopped in here late one day and it was an average bar ..<->2
Fun little bar . Perfect for lunch or a stopover on the Greyhound ( it 's about 300 feet from the station ) . The staff was friendly , there 's a small but varied drink selection , and the food was good with generous portions .<->2
Outstanding new restaurant ! Had a wonderfully balanced shakshuka on soft bread as a filling but not too heavy breakfast . Would definitely come back again to try other dishes .<->1
I love ... The chili dog its sooo good . 5 stars because its clean and the staff are delightful and they cater to you :)<->1
Everything was amazing ! Great food and service ! The hand pulled noodles are a must to try . There was n't one thing we did n't like . Will definitely be back next time we are in town !<->1
The yellow mango curry special was fantastic . Great balance of flavors , ripe mangoes and redPeppers . I ordered it with tofu which was nicely fried . Cashews added a nice texture range Delicious<->1
Place is super cool - Love the Vibe - lots of Fast Pace employees make the difference ! Grouchy must only be John cause this place I feel is the Anti - grouch lol<->1
Brew Tea Bar is the only tea bar I will visit when I 'm in Vegas ! ! ! The staff are friendly and the tea is amazing .<->1
Food taste excellent ! Order ahead ! Friendly and humble service ! Koobideh is my favorite !<->1
Loved it for years because it was the only smoke free bar in the area . The food and service were great , too . Now that they allow smoking we rarely go any more .<->2
Guess got ta try fish . Pizza soggy , sausage awesome . Wish could buy seperately ! Hand made , but pizza just soggy ! Would 've given 1 * for pizza , but not tried fish , so ...<->2
Sooooo gooood ! The ice cream crepes are ridiculous . They are large enough to share , but come on ... you know you want one to yourself .<->1
Drinks are super weak . No need for fire on the patio in the summer either . They could do better for a new bar .<->0
At $ 10.50 plus tax for the Gargantuan sandwich , I will no longer be buying them . Although it is a good sandwich , it is not worth $ 11.00<->0
Starbucks bien situé à 2 min du metro . Service rapide et courtois .<->2
The name speaks for itself . After eating my burger I felt like crap afterwards . Overall , food is not that great . If you want to have an experience though , this is the place to go .<->0
I can not not adequately describe how horrible the service is in the place . I 'm not picky but DAMN . Expensive to boot . Why bother .<->0
Not going here anymore because the guy with the beard is the second drive thru person to creep me out .<->0
Food is always great . There is always a wait but it goes quickly . Homemade guacamole is terrific .<->1
The food was perfect and my server Kelli was more than helpful and polite . I 'll be back .<->1
You ca n't beat the 5 $ lunch specials ! Specially the yellow curry on Thursdays :) Plus the owners are really nice and warm !<->1
Great service . I had the pork carnitas , I 'm used to having it shredded but it still had good flavor , but also had a lot of fat . I will try it again but I will order something else next time<->1
Excellent food , service and price . I have been to Nick 's diner 1 which is closer to where I live but will drive extra to go to Nick 's diner 2 . Diner 2 is the one that I like best .<->1
Hands down , one of the best hot pot place , I have ever been . Do n't waste time , if you do n't like fish .<->1
I was super disappointed with this place . Been wanting to come for a long time . Ordered beef gyro and the beef was really dry . Service was good but good nothing to be excited about .<->2
Probably my favorite restaurant . Not over priced but still gives off the vibe of an upscale restaurant . The service is usually pretty good from my experience . The white chocolate brownie is so good definitely share it with someone .<->1
Ice cold beers , great scenery , excellent service , and stellar food quality .<->1
Great sandwiches fast service and can I say once again great sandwiches not big on hot sandwiches myself but this place made me change my mind<->1
Not as good as it 's advertised . Dishes are over priced . The Jackpot chicken does n't taste any special than the boiled chicken we can easily make at home . I 'm not convinced .<->0
Fancy place , lots of items to choose . Fresh stuffs and lovely dessert . The best buffet I have ever tried .<->1
Just for the sake of honesty , the ownership changed years ago , but after my review was written - the place is still good , but I do n't believe the five star review is deserved any longer .<->1
Do n't order here unless you want to wait for two hours & like your food cold . If you 're in really bad luck they might also forget part of your order or get it wrong . I will never order from this place again .<->0
It does n't look like much from the outside but it 's a gem . The food is delicious and the servers are very attentive . Nice place to go with a family or for a low key date night .<->1
Legit ! Come hungry _ _ _<->1
Great Doughnuts . Just wish the bacon was little bigger pieces and greasier . The employees could n't be nicer .<->1
Expensive . And while even though the food is good . I 'm not sure if it worth getting there to find out that they 're always out of everything .<->2
Chris helped me this morning and his attitude and demeanor was excellent and he was a pleasure to deal with<->1
Good food .. Grossly over priced .. with tip $ 35 for 4 empanadas rice and beans and 1 drink ! !<->2
The perfect hole in the wall place ! If you want great , authentic , fresh food , this is the kind of place you go !<->1
Bad day here , not really crowded came in got seated and waited , waited and waited for 15 min went and talked to guy at register who was clueless , may have to think about service issues here<->0
Our new favorite breakfast / lunch place to go . Had breakfast and lunch there . The Reuben sandwich was delicious . Service and price was great .<->1
So amazing love the lemon meringue shaved ice so delicious and the staff was very friendly and helpful<->1
I did n't listen to my instincts and went back there and things have n't changed . Serving portions suck and food was salty !<->0
Nice Guys , The Breakfast egg burrito was A - Ok . Try the verde salsa , unique . Just a note : the prices even for dinner are all under $ 8 . Seem to me to be a decent value .<->2
Bomb all around definitely worth the wait . The music playing in the background was a perfect touch # oldschoolhiphop<->1
This is amazing breakfast joint ! ! We had the breakfast burrito and biscuits and gray with the butter milk pancake ! ! This is from Hawaii style food as well highly recommend<->1
Great Sichuan . Try the fish in yellow pepper . Comes under a mound of dried red pepper , like many dishes here . The effect is as numbing as it is spicy . Many dishes can be oily , but that 's where the flavor is .<->1
Great local steakhouse , good atmosphere , micro - brews , and reasonable prices . The restaurant will unfortunately be torn down in the near future to make room for a resort , so I 'll miss this place .<->1
Thumbs up ! Always great service , great food , fantastic atmosphere . The Branzino is first rate and the tagliatelle with meat sauce is another winner . Also , best restaurant view of the city in town .<->1
Wide variety of froyo and toppings , good fresh fruit toppings . Great location . Cool environment on a hot day or night .<->1
40 min wait for a plate of chicken teriyaki ... I do n't think these people understand that they operate in an airport .<->0
Great spot if you work uptown ! I 've been here at least 3 times and I normally do n't post great / horrible reviews unless I am very impressed by their quality or upset haha . You have got to try this food<->1
The food was absolutely delicious , full of flavor . The people there are super friendly . It is a restaurant and a small grocery store . Would definitely eat there again but prefer take out .<->1
I think the drinks are fabulous , the food is OK . Definitely not a kid friendly spot , more of a happy hour with your girlfriends .<->2
The fact that this place exists makes me happy haha Nutmeg is the cutest little bakeshop on main street and their chocolate croissants and butter tarts are to die for ! A must - try for everyone<->1
Very bad experience here . Do n't come here . The owner is rude and have no respect for customers .<->0
Their sushis are good ! It 's convenient ! Grateful it opened here ! Good Bulgogi ! ... but like , nothing special .<->1
Very disappointing . Everything was incredibly bland , no flavor or heat . I will not order from here again .<->0
Great tacos and margaritas . I 'd stay away from the bowls - the shrimp bowl was disappointing , but the tacos are delicious . A fun place to hangout with your friends .<->1
The newest Andre 's Bistro just opened and is well worth the wait ! Killer Lobster Roll and great wine list ! Not to mention the friendly staff and warm ambiance !<->1
This place was great ! Excellent service , fresh and delicious ! I had the pink lady roll and the kawaii roll - both superb ! Such a great hole in the wall<->1
This place has a great happy hour . The Scottsdale people - watching is top - notch , too . Highly recommended place for good sushi in Old Town . I always sit outside on the patio ...<->1
Red Bowl is always a great choice . It can get a little busy at times , but is worth the wait . The generous portions will leave you full and the flavors will satisfy the pallet .<->1
I love their chicken tender salad with parmesan garlic sauce on the chicken . Yummy !<->1
The honey butter chicken burger on a brioche was fresh , crunchy and moist . The crinkled fries perfect for a ketchup commercial ! Service was quick and friendly .<->1
lab just order food for lunch . i have thai fried rice . the food just so so . but in a large quantity anyway . See somebody commended it as the best thai food in toronto . I just keep my opinion<->2
Greasiest pizza I 've ever tried . Could n't even eat it because the grease soaked through the crust and it was falling apart . I 'm from NY and I would rather eat nasty chain store pizza over this stuff !<->0
Had salmon entree which had small salad and hummus . Good value , very clean , bright , and spacious place . Good vegetarian options too .<->1
Service was great . Nice atmosphere as a diner from the past . I had the best chicken pot pie I have ever eaten for a late lunch today .<->1
Food ... ExcellentService ... Below AverageAmbience ... Great<->2
Worst drive thru ! If you are in a time crunch do n't bother ! Slowest I have ever been in . Spent 12 min in line just for a coffee . Do n't know why I come back to this location .<->0
I went in asking for something relatively healthy , and they literally said " no , this is Buffalo Wild Wings " . If that floats your boat then yeehaa to you<->2
This is a great piano bar ! great vibe and drunk people falling at the drop of a hat ! got ta love it ! !<->1
Had a great lunch yesterday and Amanda was great . Her service was top notch and she recommended great meals .<->1
Looks like a great bakery however for what I would call " Brunch " I would expect a sit down area . This is carry out only .<->2
This location is not accessible for wheelchair users . There are stairs to the main dinning area .<->0
Really cute place with friendly staff . I really liked the protein muffin and ginger tumeric tea I ordered . Thank you Adda staff !<->1
Duck noodle soup is amazing . Very high quality at a great price . Service exceptional .<->1
Good delicious food . Loved the ambiance and the fresh ingredients .<->1
We were here twice because we liked the food and service so much . The second time we were here , we had a server named Oscar . He was fantastic ! Next time we 're in Vegas , we 'll be coming here again !<->1
Great steak . Romantic atmosphere . Definitely a top choice for a special occasion ! $ $ $<->1
Food was delicious . Our server , Javier , was friendly and knowledgeable . Tony the manager was personable and hilarious . 13/10 would dine again because y not .<->1
I love how they are quicker on the phones than wal - mart ! Wal - mart can kiss it ! and the woman in the bakery was the biggest sweetheart !<->1
Second 's a charm . Buffet breakfast is ok minimal but one more Omlete pancake chef would be great so there no line or long wait . Good variety . Got ta check it out .<->2
Went back for lunch and had a sandwich and nachos . This place is still awesome .<->1
Meh . Long wait . Risotto undercooked , salmon OK . Lobster mac n cheese missing lobster , runny cheese . Failed to seat on patio as reserved . Gave table to another group . Enjoyed my post meal cheeseburger from In N Out . I hate pretentiousness .<->0
Dessert poutine to die for . Canadian burger is made with great quality . Super tasty and the bacon was perfect . Lettuce was a little oversized . Salad was fresh . Kitchen staff rocks here . Schooners we 're a great price on Thursday . Courtney was an epic hostess .<->1
Long wait , decent service , high prices ... Who cares ! It 's all worth it . I do n't even like seafood that much , but this place is so delicious . Get the combo pan and split it . You ca n't go wrong !<->1
Food is always good . My toddler is pretty picky and he always eats very well here . The cashier is always nice and helpful .<->1
This is great place and we have fan in here . I really recommend spicy crab . ? ? ?<->1
Holy butter batman . Everything was rich and awesome . Cream and butter ruled the meal . Classic , well prepared and super enjoyable . We 'll be back for sure .<->1
Friendly staff , good tea and wifi . I did work in the old bank vault which was nice and quiet despite the crowd . Will definitely be back here to do work in the future .<->1
Great food and great service .. Will be top 5 places for lunch and dinner .. Great mixture of dishes from different cultures .. Recommend everyone to give them a try<->1
Best make your own shop I have been too . Good crust , hot oven , great toppings . A must try .<->1
We keep coming back to this place for its calamari , Moscato and braised short ribs ... not to mention their excellent service . I 'm a very picky person but I LOVE their calamari and their lobster flatbread with truffle honey . A must try !<->1
Friendly , clean and generous . The 6yo ninja got the cheese pizza and gave it good marks . My Hawaiian sub was sweet and spicy , and the fries were a highlight . Bloody Mary was terrific .<->1
I think I 've found it ! I 've been searching for the best croissant and I finally decided it 's at Le Delice on Lorne Park in Mississauga ( Port Credit ) . They also have a lot of other great stuff . If your on a diet stay away .<->1
Best Cheese Steak in town and it 's a Packers teamed decor ! You def need to get the Cheese Curds ! Anytime is a good time to come ! Family friendly !<->1
Love the Hef , love the staff . The prices are great , and I can bring in my own food .<->1
First time I came and food is absolutely amazing ! Vegan menu is perfect Jovanni is a great waiter 5 service<->1
Orded a stake frites here and it was perfect . It was grilled exactly how I requested it and the sauce was marvelous . Strangely enough it went really good with my tea aswel , which made the waiter and me giggle .<->1
Excellent customer service and delicious food . It was our first time and we were pretty much full after the samples they gave us . We will definitely be back !<->1
The tacos are very good . So much flavor in a small package . I would highly recommend this place to anyone who is in the mood for food tacos at a good value .<->1
Awesome food and great set up . Really difficult to find as it 's part of culinary drop out but did have complimentary valet parking . Would recommend the poke bowl !<->1
Love this place ! The BYOC is amazing ! Best pork chop I 've ever had . The Mexican Benedict is good , the Banger is good , it 's all yummy !<->1
Christina is lit AF ! ! ! Best server ever . Super sweet and made our experience at the restaurant without a doubt .<->1
without regoing to this place i will raise my rating based on what I ve heard from others who are fans of their food . When I attended the pizza seemed to be popular , staff was friendly .<->2
Wow , Killer Kabob Trio - dish . The pita served hot at the table with olive oil dipping sauce gets me coming back for that alone . Friendly staff greets you with a smile and service is excellent . Dog friendly patio<->1
So , what is it about In - N - Out Burger lettuce ? I do n't even like iceberg lettuce . In - N - Out iceberg actually has a delicious flavor . Is it organic ? Is it a new variety ? WTG In - N - Out ! Thanks for being so selective .<->1
The mango tango crepe is my favorite . The service is very friendly and it 's a nice little place . The price is a bit high .<->1
Upscale desperately needed sports bar in DC Ranch . A billion TVs in a very cool space paired with outstanding food and a great cocktail / beer list . It 's buzzing and is a fun place to watch a college FB game .<->1
Best chocolate chip cookies EVER ! ! ! Friendly staff and always great food !<->1
Best Vietnamese Place in the Entire Phx Metro area ! Locations sucks but the food is sooo good ... it is worth the drive !<->1
Poor hygiene , found a hair in pizza while chewing and when confronted to the store customer service rep they ignored and put me on hold for 20 minutes ! Rude customer service ! ! ! I 'll advise you to try another location !<->0
Only had a couple things at this attractive little restaurant - a soup and spring rolls - but I have definitely had better ! The service could be a little more relaxed . I think I 'll stick with Thai House .<->0
Obsessed with this place ! ! ! Better than Buffalo wild wings , better than wing stop just amazing ! Their fries are the best and the staff is always nice !<->1
Discovered a new breakfast place , tried it out . its very cheery and inviting , they 've added unquie dishes to the menu , a step away from the traditional breakfast . Food was good !<->1
Terrible . I ordered a meatball sub . When i opened the wrap it was filled with sause.the bun was drenched and soggy.the meatball was worse then hamburger helper . Mush no taste.yuck . luke warm and tiny peice of cheese.disgusting<->0
Good quality all round . On the pricey side , but serves unique food and cocktails . Good atmosphere and nice size establishment . Must make a reservation . As it 's sometimes hard to get a table . Clean , open kitchen and amenities .<->1
I chose a cute ducky yard filled with a Sour Gummy cocktail . Delicious and lasted all night ! !<->1
Cod sandwich for lunch was very good . Quick service and did n't wait long for our meal . Will definitely return .<->1
This is hands down the best restaurant in Boulder City . The staff is wonderful and the food is excellent . I eat here at least twice a week .<->1
What a great restaurant / brewhouse ! I had the polish brat with sauerkraut and red onions . It was fantastic . The fries were excellent as well .<->1
I love this place . Happy hour is 50 % off selected items but those are delicious . Try the Asian Nachos .<->1
Nice find in Montreal ! Overall good food and authentic . Black beans had no flavor but everything else we ordered was good .<->1
There are not to many places around ( let alone in old town Scottsdale ) where you can get such a cool vibe , have great craft beer and coffee and the service is the best part of the whole experience ! ! !<->1
One of the best place for bar food . Vampire TacoChicken NachosChicken StripsMushroom Pizza .. Sliders . Ahhh . Great food for the money . Friendly staff . Would return<->1
They take great care of East Madison Toyota . Always prompt and friendly . Food is what you 'd expect . Bread is way better then Subway<->1
Awesome food , great service and friendly employees . My husband and I got lunch today : double decker , stuff nacho wrap and a bean burrito . All were so good .<->1
Weekend lunch with friends . Takes a while to make the food . Pricey . * Avoid the calzone * Worst calzone ever .<->0
Great brisket sandwich and corn ! Def worth it .<->1
The tofu satay is the best . Love it for a quick place to grab dinner . The staff is really friendly and the place is clean and tidy .<->1
Was there at 5 am . Nice place , friendly people . Donuts were some of the better ones I 've had . Not greasy not sickening sweet like the chain store donuts . Bacon maple donut to die for<->1
Great food . Great service . WIsh they had more seating available . Long wait for table . Also very noisy . tables extremely close together . Otherwise , Great<->1
We have eaten here on 3 occasions now and every time we have had a great experience . Food is great and the service is awesome . Highly recommend the wild bore .<->1
Love love love . Small , intimate , and unpretentious spot with friendly service . You can get decent beers and drinks at a lot of places in this area , but not every spot provides the same friendly , relaxed atmosphere .<->1
Great all you can eat sushi just north of the strip in the premium outlet center .<->1
Most delicious crepe I 've ever tried ! ! I decided to get the Nutella crepe and I could n't believe how delicious it was ! This will be my first stop when I 'm in Vegas . Their pastries look delicious too !<->1
Food was okay , just very small portions . Service was pretty slow , all around not that impressed .<->2
Good food and cheap drinks are a perfect combination . Great place to relax without having to make reservations or stand in line . Stop by and you will see what I am talking about .<->1
Great place for a date night ... The ambience is dark and relaxing .<->1
Food is freaking delicious . Had the skinny margarita and it may be the best margarita I 've ever had . Service is decent . I recommend going for happy hour , and taco Tuesday . That 's the only time it 's really affordable .<->1
Great atmosphere , cool music . Dinner was excellent and served hot . Service was exceptional . Will be going back !<->1
Decor is dated , but the food is fantastic . My favorite is the chicken masala and the samosas . They have many vegetarian dishes as well .<->1
Very slow service . Have been waiting for a chicken sandwich for 25 minutes . It came finally and is undercooked .<->0
Loved Barros old recipe . Sauce and crust is different . Staff very nice every time . Just so much crust .<->2
I liked this outlet but I did n't really find anything that made me squeal . My mother did buy me the cutest Coach purse for my birthday so that gives mommy 5 stars and the actual mall a 3 .<->2
The Good : Great serviceWonderful dessertsCleanThe Bad : Everything Else<->0
First time here and despite the loud atmosphere the food was exceptional . The shrimp is the best I 've ever had . And the wings are the best too ( so says my picky husband ) . So go there . You 'll enjoy<->1
I met the owner and ate at his soul food restaurant in LA for years and had no idea he was the owner of this a place ! ! These cakes are AMAZING ! ! ! And the food is Brilliant too ! Run do n't walk !<->1
I go here 5 times a week for breakfast before work . Always greeted by the friendly staff who display great customer service . Normally I would n't think to review a ' fast food ' place , but the exceptional service should be recognized .<->1
this place is great , the parantha are freshly made . for the price you are really getting your money 's worth<->1
Breakfast here was not bad . We were headed home and this was my last meal in Vegas . I had the omelette with ham , spinach , tomato , onions , and cheddar cheese . I 'm not sure you can go wrong with that .<->2
Very good service . Best Taco Bell in Madison . By far . Managers are phenomenal . Food is great . Service on point .<->1
Canteen does n't deliver on its promise . Breakfast was a bland cold omelette served on a hot plate . Service was inexperienced and awkward . On the plus side , the artisan breads were tasty and the place is airy and comfortable .<->0
This is my go to spot for bloody mary 's . The house made clamato creole is a personal favorite and they have an extensive list of vodkas to choose from . The staff are personable , helpful , and attentive . Great brunch place !<->1
Terrible service . Did not honor the buy 2 get 1 free yelp check - in . Very disappointed .<->0
Nice , clean room & really good food but of course pricey since it 's connected to the airport . I would stay here again .<->1
They actually do roast duck rather well . You can get 1/2 or a whole one . I wen't here for most of my meals in grad school . The owners are great . Personable service.ddc<->1
Santa Clara university baseball team just are here . What a place ! Great food and great environment . If you are looking for some great Italian food and great people check this place out !<->1
BEST BAR IN LAS VEGAS ! ! ! That really is all that has to be said . Always packed , great service although at times a tad slow do to how busy it gets . But in long run you know you 're going to get quality !<->1
The food was mediocre Mexican food . I ordered enchiladas and the tortillas were extremely dried out . The rice and enchilada sauce did not have much flavor . The staff was friendly .<->2
After hearing so much about Sycamore , I was excited to try it for myself . It lived up to the hype . Great beer !<->1
Great experience . Made a reservation for two on short notice . Wine selection was fantastic . Attentive and great service . Sashimi appetizer , warm goat cheeae salad and sea bass - every bite was exceptional . I will definitely be back .<->1
this place is great and very friendly ! the fresh rolls are amazing . I really enjoy their food ! i love that they carry fresh chilli peppers<->1
always go in and ask to sit in Jessica 's section . she is the best and such a sweetie . I had the # 9 beer and some sliders always a good combo !<->2
Stopped in for a quick lunch . Delicious rice noodle salad with grilled pork and spring rolls . Wings were good too . Definitely recommend !<->1
Their food is great . The chips and dips are amazing ! The servers are always awesome . The atmosphere is nice .<->1
Breakfast YES ! ! ! Nice place with no loud noise & felt welcomed . Nice place to chill with a view of Olympia jump with plenty of parking FREE .<->1
Love this place ! Food comes to the table piping hot every time ! Staff is friendly & fun !<->1
I love this teriyaki madness . Great service and great food . I can never get tired of rice veggies and chicken . There are so many varieties and it 's all healthier choices . I like to use coupons and save on my order .<->1
Love this place . Whenever I go there i always enjoy my food and drinks . Stuff are very friendly and well trained . They always smile and look like they are happy to work there :-) )<->1
Steak DinnerAmbience : 4/5 fine for a business mtg , date etc . But nothing unique . Food : 4/5 Service : 2/5 friendly but slooooowValue : 4/5 Repeat : not sure<->2
The worse meal I have had in a very long time . Waited over forty five mintues for two sandwhiches . When we finally received our meal it was so greasy we were unable to eat . Would noy go back again !<->0
Only thing open 24 at NY NYDecent serviceTerrible FoodHigh pricesWill not return<->0
LOVE IT . Simple . Great food . Excellent service . We came here on our honeymoon and it was Amazing .<->1
Slow service and did n't give my kids any sauce for their nuggets even though we asked for some . They were not very friendly either<->2
Urban Beans is great ! The best place in DTPHX for a Matcha Green Tea Smoothie . Plus , they Belly which gives you frequent buyer perks :) Belly : https://getbelly.com/<->1
Absolutely love the music and the food . Real Mexican food with a great environment . Make sure you stop by if your in the area and having the tacos is an absolute must .<->1
Very good Cuban food and a very authentic place ! They barely spoke English to us once but we had a great time !<->1
Their quesadilla burger gave me food poisoning . ' Nuff said .<->0
Awesome flavors Galore ! ! ! So many yummy treats to choose from ! It 's my favorite ice cream place in Nevada & honestly the only ice cream place I keep going back to . Everything else falls short .<->1
YUM ! This place is sooo good . The Zombie Roll is fire , But beware they do n't serve Sushi on Tuesdays ! The Tom Yung Ghai ( sp ? ) is the most delicious soup I have ever had !<->1
Great rotating beer selection . Good bar type food . They also do special events for beer week and other good national breweries .<->1
My favorite restaurant in Calgary ! Lobster tempura and ahi tuna tartar are my favorite apps . I have always had the fish special for dinner and have n't been disappointed once . Miss the coconut crepe though since they changed the menu .<->1
The burgers were amazing ! Had the brulee while my husband had the weekly special . After my burger , the seasoned fries , and the maple pecan bacon shake , I was a happy girl . Would definitely go back again ! !<->1
This is a jewel of a Japanese restaurant . Creative , beautiful and the service is attentive .<->1
This spot reminds me of Jamba Juice but u can also order other things such as sandwiches . Sits next to a movie theater ..<->1
Chocolate Caramel Cocoa is a must try , best Cocoa ever ( I ai n't fan of cocoa but this one is really good ) . Potatoes well cooked . Omelette well made .<->1
This is one of my favorite local watering wholes the staff is absolutely awesome . The food here is great and they have some sweet happy hour specials even on Saturdays . Thanks lLucky 's<->1
Barbeque chicken pizza and sweet potato fries ! ! ! OMG ! ! my fav ! ! ! this place is awesome from prices to choices to the ambiance to music and energy ! definitely stop by and check this hot spot out !<->1
Un bon choix de produits , un peu limité côté fromage mais ca vaut la peine , j'aime énormément . Prix raisonnables , bons service !<->1
Stopped in with my husband and two kids because we happened to be in the area on a Friday late afternoon . The service and good were both amazing and the margaritas were top notch ! ! Will definitely be back !<->1
This is a great place to go . Great prices and I love their sandwiches always great service and the friendliest people . Always a great pleasure everytime I go there !<->1
Ehh . I was n't impressed . Lots of people told me about this place before I went and tried it . Once we finally got there the staff were n't the friendliest and the food was overpriced and not overly tasty .<->0
We loved the food , the service , and the ambience -- great views of the Strip . Will definitely come back . Even my non - foodie hubby thought it was great ( though the short rib was a bit teensy for him ) .<->1
The sundaes and just a simple Strawberry ice cream cone have always been wonderful . I just wished that when they gave you a glass of water , they gave you more than the 4 - 5 oz glass .<->1
Pretty disappointing overall . Rice was undercooked , food was in some cases too sweet , in others too bland . Not impressed .<->0
Slowest Starbucks ever . I still can not fathom why an ice coffee literally takes 15 minutes to order and receive every single time . They never mix my order up but they always do apologize for the unreasonable wait .<->0
I get paramount for takeout every couple months but when I got mine today , it was half the portions . I 'm quite surprised by this and I will not be going back to paramount anymore . I 'm really annoyed by this .<->0
Bad bad bad ! The sign in the store window should read " sorry we are open " cold food bad food and really bad service ... anyone can open a can of peas mash them and call that mushy peas !<->0
Great service . How ever the food was not so great , seaweed salad had a pond water after taste ! Gyoza had no flavor and dipping sauce lacked flavor ! It 's just bad sushi .<->0
Ordered a margherita pizza and it was DELICIOUS ! Wood stove really brings out the authentic italian flavour . me likey ! :D<->1
Love this place , going there since it 's open and even before that ate their grilled cheese . Southern Comfort and Shroomin are out of this world .<->1
Always hot and very fast service . Amazing Gluten Free pizza ! Delivery people are nice<->1
I really liked the pizza here . I had the cheese and meant to go back to grab another slice , but I was too lazy to make the trek to the elevators . Slices are huge .<->1
Best Italian for a reasonable price . Overall best handmade pasta in phoenix Scottsdale .<->1
Amazing food ! Fabulous service ! Great atmosphere ! Ask for Joel , he is an amazing waiter !<->1
Love their food ! Love that they have vegan options and it 's healthy tasty food . Everyone 's always so nice and attentive<->1
Best Ice Cream In Town ! ! ! , Live In Hunting Ridge So It Is Very Convenient And " Delightful " :)<->1
Food was amazing ! The angry lobster was the most flavorful sushi roll I have ever tasted and there fried rice was to die for ! ! ! Highly recommend this place for anyone looking for cheap but high quality sushi .<->1
This stuff is heavenly . The sea salt caramel defies description . IF you have n't had any yet , you should stop what you are doing and look them up right now !<->1
Found them on Twitter . Went to Quicken Loans yesterday and ordered the Steak and Blue . Delicious and large enough serving for leftovers . Definitely now in my rotation !<->1
Hype around this restaurant exceeds its execution . Food was either over cooked , under cooked or barely warm . For the price you need to deliver , and it just does n't . Skip this one .<->2
We had takeout tonight for the first time . The Food was excellent and the portions were large . Seasoned just right and lots of meat . Will definitely be back .<->1
Got ta like it fried , that 's what you get . Phoenix icon , been around for a long time . Be sure go bring cash , only can pay with cash . Outside dining only .<->2
Restaurant is small cozy . Although we had two hours waiting period at the restaurant it was worth waiting . Food just tastes good brings memory back from India . Loved their cheese butter masala and paneer tikka masala . And service was friendly .<->1
Happy hour ambiance is great . Patio is nice to sit at and you ca n't beat $ 5 wine ! Service was a bit slow . Recommend bruschetta for wine pairing but note no appetizers are on sale for happy hour . Would go back !<->1
Placed an order for catering for a group of 8 for lunch . I ordered lunch boxes for all . Ordered : Fresh Deluxe Boxed Lunch / wraps ! Very good and the Basil Pesto Tortellini was the favorite of all .<->1
I took my girlfriend here for our first year anniversary . Heather , waited on us and was amazing and super helpful , made us feel welcome and happy to help us celebrate . We 'll be back for the thurs special<->1
Service was excellent and the food was amazing . The Greek salad is top notch and the steak sandwich was amazing . Great place to watch a game and enjoy a good time with friends .<->1
Great place great food any day any time ... I love the lunch menu and even better is they 're b day clubOh . Yeah ...<->1
Food was excellent . Had mozzarella cheese with fresh tomatoes and also the margarita pizza and it was perfectly made nice outdoor patio to sit down highly recommend this place .<->1
Taco Tuesday is a great deal . Great tacos for $ 1 ! My new favorite Tuesday tradition ! Taste : 1/2 Presentation : 1/1 Atmosphere : 1/1 Service : 1/14 / 5<->1
Great food . Even though the dining room is not 5 stars , it is a really good place to go . So glad there is a place like this on the west side .<->1
Ok so the burger was pretty good . Would prob get a single next time . Fries are pretty good alone but add your own salt . What amazed me was the shakes . So smooth and creamy . Definitely will change your life !<->1
This is a nice classic Irish pub . Nothing to too different from other Irish pubs . That being said it is always a great time and they have a good selection of beers on tap .<->2
Never ordered from here before cuz I thought I was out of the delivery area . So glad I 'm not . Late night weekend delivery and the pizza is delicious . My new favourite !<->1
UPDATE ... they will be reopening in a couple more weeks . NEW owners . NEW NAMES.Half will be Toscana Italian Bistro and the other half Pomo Pizzeria . Owner has 2 other pizzeria locations , Phoenix and Scottsdale .<->1
This is a nice little place with lots of interesting gelato flavors . I tried about six of them and decided on the pomegranate , which was delicious . I highly recommend trying this place out if you like gelato .<->1
My regular rating for McDonald 's ( 3 stars ) , except the parking really sucks here ! That 's why I took off another star lol food is like all mcDs .<->0
Food was good . Went for Thursday night football . 49 cent wings ! Yeah !<->1
Probably the best breakfast place in the US . Worth the wait every time . And the staff always welcome me in and always say goodbye . Thanks Matt !<->1
Food was good , service was n't the best . The decor is eclectic and the outside garden seating is nice though ! Will try it again .<->2
I like the $ 2 off deal ... pizza is good , beer is cold and lots of Tv 's . Great place to be on Sundays . Lots of beer to choose from . A great place to be .<->1
Horrible service ... I felt rushed and the food was basically thrown at me even though there were n't any other customers around .<->0
I love the pizza . All I can say it was hard to find even with directions haha . We had to use are noses to smell the amazing pizza . So good ... yummy must try<->1
Chicken and waffles were amazing . Staff was very friendly , everyone worked as a team and you could tell<->1
Pretty decent place . Good variety of food . Even though the name says hot pot , they do serve " regular " food . Hot pot was also surprisingly decent and had a pretty good variety of food<->1
Do n't let the Vegan word scare you . You do n't have to be Vegan to eat here . Delicious food , excellent customer service . Someone buy them a location so everyone can eat their food every day !<->1
Very clean , employees are professional , could use a few less cars while your backing into the dock . Fresh food and coffee good way to start the day .<->1
food has been over cooked or undercooked last couple of times I 've been there . I 've really tried to like this place but I think I 've made my last visit .<->0
Went in with my cousin he got a burger I got a cheesesteak and we both spent most of the night in the bathroom ... food was not good ! They make a much better burger 2doors down from mikes at phonicia ...<->0
Service is n't the best but sushi is pretty good . Lunch specials for the win :) dinner is a tad pricy<->2
Delicious ! We had the falafel plate , grape leaves and lentil soup , and everything was great ! Also the service is really good :) will definitely come back !<->1
By far the worst Taco Bell anywhere . Service is terrible , slow , rude . never again . Since they are on every other corner I wo n't be going back to this one . I think Chantell R needs training ..<->0
The banana gelato was the best gelato I 've ever had ( including in Italy ) . The chocolates seemed pricey . The woman working was very nice and helpful .<->1
Good place for lunch . I recently went for the first time and the service and food were good . Convenient location and nice ambiance .<->1
The pho is hot and large and tasty , and everyone who 's in the know knows this place is awesome sauce . Do n't mind if I do !<->1
Good sushi and Bento boxes . My wife is gluten free and always gets the Hibachi Chicken with gluten free soy sauce and substitutes the shrimp tempura with additional California roll .<->1
This new bingsoo location is stellar ! Interior is modern , service is hospitable , snow is delicious ! Ca n't wait to try the small baked goods available as well .<->1
The pizza here is fantastic ! Perfect for individual lunch portions . If coming for lunch , there 's a bit of a lineup so be warned . However , definitely worth the wait .<->1
I eat out at a lot of Mexican restaurants , and this is probably my favorite in town right now . Amazing food<->1
In town for the week . One of the best General Tso 's chicken I 've had . Good service . Will be back this week .<->1
Went to brunch . The food is good ( buffet ) . My only suggestion is that the two men working th he buffet and bar need to stop wandering around , standing in the customer 's way , and try being less awkward .<->2
Always happy with the food and the service no matter what the time or the shape I 'm in when I visit ;)<->1
I did n't know what all the fuss was about until I joined ... Now I 'm totally all - in with this cult ...<->1
Super , recommandé . Bonne expérience O Noir . En plus le service de réservation avec Yelp fonctionne parfaitement .<->1
Good food for the price . Better than many other sushi places on Queen St . so it 's my go - to in the area .<->1
Attended a very large gathering upstairs . All of the food was very good and the service was constant and attentive .<->1
I love Spinatos pizza . But their house wine is terrible . I would rather drink 3 buck Chuck . Get a new house wine ! It reflects badly to have a house wine that is undrinkable .<->1
Best Slovak food I 've had in Canada , and probably much better than some restaurants I 've been to in Slovakia . the Svietkova , Segedin Gula  and the Halusky are amazing . Love the new look and that they have a pool table .<->1
I love this place and I am a frequent customer , but honestly The quality is not always consistent , and sometimes it depends on who prepares your meal ! ! ! but still its value for money compared to other places in downtown .<->1
Drool worthy ! The food is A - mazing ! So authentic and flavourful , prepare to leave stuffed ! The wait , not so fun but worth every minute , half hour or hour !<->1
Fantastic ! Great food . Great service . An altogether well packaged gift to the east valley . Please get out & support them !<->1
Really great food , a little pricey bit really good quality ! The staff was very nice could have been a bit more attentive but Had a great time with my babee ! We will definitely be back again soon !<->1
How can two small soggy pieces of pepperoni pizza cost $ 9.00 without a drink ? ? Never again for me ! ! No thanks ..<->0
Cool little spot . Dropped in for lunch and it was great . Great burgers priced right . Staff was attentive and friendly . Awesome tee shirts for sale too . Loved the Gangster theme throughout .<->1
The Chicken trio is great value for the money and it tastes great . I usually take it spicy with extra tomatoes instead of turnips .<->1
We LOVE their delicious soups . Great place for a late night snack . The atmosphere is friendly and the service is good . They have live music on Saturday nights .<->1
Soooooo goodBetter than subwayBetter taste better serviceAnd roll ice cream is fantastic<->1
The b . e . l . t . Is amazing ! I added avocado and it was to die for ! The Dijon mustard aioli made the sandwich . $ 5 for beer pitchers and wine by the glass , an awesome deal . Definitely recommend for brunch<->1
Great breakfast , great service . Best bagel shop in Las Vegas !<->1
They still cut the pizza with scissors and then you pay by weight just like in RomeJust like at my house except I do n't have a scaleAnd the pizza is still the best in the area<->1
Horrible food , horrible service ! ! Charged me double tip , refuse to refund . Never going there again .<->0
Do n't miss this store ! ! It has everything ! The Chile Lime Pistachios were really good . Its kind of tucked off to the side so you have to look at the side streets to find cool places like this .<->1
Friendly staff , delicious craving inducing crust , fun flavourful toppings , and great drinks ! Very popular spot , with an often short wait . Many great nearby bars to help kill some time .<->1
Rude crowd hangs out here . Not very welcoming of new comers . Snotting group of regulars will ruin a good time .<->0
Excellent dinner . Escargot was fantastic . Duck poutine divine . Creme brûlée was fantastic !<->1
Perfect , service and food are both amazing ! We ordered chicken tikka and kebab , they are both very tasty , the soup is great too<->1
Good food , service is lacking ! I used to go to mike and Rhondas the place but it is on bell which is a little far . Service is way better there and for quality is same . Maybe I 'll go back<->2
I came here because it 's close to my hotel , just to grab a quick lunch . But the chicken is like my grandmother used to make back in the 60s . Really good !<->1
Wonderful . Food that is uncompromisingly deliciousEliot Wexler has done it again . Watch out tempe . There is a new restaurant in town and it is amazing . You must go before the lines start forming . Great experience<->1
Really cool place with some actual good country playing ... not a ton of that hickhop crap ! Haha . Great happy hour prices and very friendly staff ! Love it<->1
Ordered here for years when we lived in the area . Great for western Chinese dishes . Good ginger beef !<->1
I love this pizza & wings come here with my brother all the tine . Fresh pizza dough made by the owner . Pizza and wing combo is the way to go .<->1
Great food and huge portions if you can stand the long wait as this place is uber popular .<->1
This place has horrible service food sucked the only that was good was the fried fish but we only seen waitress 3 times in 2 hours . Ridiculous . I will not be coming back .<->0
Great flavor . Very reasonably priced . Gets very crowded so get there early during lunch . Nice setting<->1
Only reviewing the drinks here - expensive and the margarita tasted like there was n't any tequila in it . Will definitely not be back .<->0
Rebel is awesome ! Great bar food and an incredible and always evolving beer list . Been coming here about once a week because it is my neighborhood bar . Sachi is the best ! Thank you Rebel ! ! !<->1
This place is sooooo good ! Eat the beef tacos , and get the Guac with them . :)<->1
I was pleasantly surprised by this place . The atmosphere and food were both good . It was on the pricey side , especially for a self - serve , almost fast - food type place .<->1
Was not a big fan of how they make their meals . And beef tastes like it was over cooked and was still saturated in grease .<->0
Got a 12 Oz prime rib for lunch and flavor wise it was meh it arrived cold needed salt and 1/4 of my steak was just a chunk of fat took a nice photo , not a fan .<->0
Honestly , I love the food and drink , but I 'm beyond tired of the rude hostess and servers that I 've encountered on several occasions<->0
I like this place - nice assortment of stores / brands that will satisfy everyone on your shopping list .<->1
Super yum , best part is its very clean authentic Indian , not that greasy chewy stuff you might get other places . Loved this place will def . be going again .<->1
Upscale hukah cafe . Good music , good vibes with comfortable seating that suits a hukah lounge .<->1
Kind of blah . I had the combination of broiled scallops and large shrimp . It was about 6 pieces of each for $ 16.99 . Seemed kind of high priced for what I received . Probably wo n't go back .<->2
Do n't write many reviews but had to for this place . Amazing first impression ! ! ! . It is authentic , friendly , tasty , and satisfying . So glad it 's in downtown . I hope to become a regular at this restaurant .<->1
Simple and small restaurant . It is very clean and the food is always fresh and so good . Very friendly staff .<->1
If you 're into shitty and packed bro bars in the west end of Lakewood , this is probably your home base . Horrible place .<->0
The best Mexican food I 've had . Family owned and delicious . Whenever I 'm in town I go at least twice . The cheese crisp is the delicious with or without green chilis . Chicken chimichanga is amazing .<->1
I have found this Buffet for AMERICAN , CHINESE , Japanese to be of very good quality , friendly service and staff . I normally try to go here at least once a week . The price is very low for such quality .<->1
This place is awesome ! They can custom make whatever you want ! They were very understanding of my complex order . The staff is extremely friendly . I would come back here for the food and staff :)<->1
I love their American Royale burger and the beer is always great . I like coming here with my coworkers and enjoying a nice kickback . Have also had company dinners here . Great atmosphere and food .<->1
Ahhh - mazing ! I 've eaten there twice and the cappuccino was perfect ( Seriously hard to come by ) & my breakfast sandwich was filling . I will return to buy bread .<->1
Love this place . Very friendly employees and coffee was so gooooood . I will never go to any place but here definitely stop by again<->1
Tasty twist on Simple menu , extremely fresh . Food is top notch , service good as well . This place is 5 stars . Location much nicer than downtown as well . Priced modestly .<->1
Amazing garden pizza , made perfect . Loved how organized and clean and friendly everyone was . Will be back .<->1
I love the creme Brûlée ! ! Also had some type of raspberry lemon tart . To die for ! This place is A hidden Charlotte gem<->1
We had our 35 year class reunion here . Awesome food and great service . Great atmosphere ! Ca n't wait to go back !<->1
Used to be a regular customer until today . Walked in and an a - hole of a manager told us the wait was 3 hours . Complete dick about the whole situation , and never made eye contact . I will never go back .<->0
You get what you pay for . Good in a pinch . Too much MSG . The chicken chop suey is great !<->0
I drove by the other day , and decided to drop in and check the brand new location that just open . It 's very clean , selection it 's massive . Great Prices , staff very polite , and the knowledge is great . Very Professional !<->1
I 've been going here for years and by far the latest owner has produced the best sushi yet ! I 've loved everything I 've ever ordered .<->1
Love their dounuts ! Very friendly and ready to serve you ! Every Saturday I take a box of doughnuts and they love it<->1
Great service , awesome $ 1 street tacos . The bartender was so friendly . The husband and I live nearby and decided to check it out . The queso was also really yummy .<->1
Great service and recommendations ! Food was amazing ! ! Had the toppings for a burger on a chicken breast . Delicious !<->1
The food is extraordinary , no matter what you order ! Unbelievable owners - friendly , fun , family people who truly love and appreciate their customers .<->1
I tried three different dishes and could n't finish any of them . You can find much better food at panda express . Pathetic .<->0
Excellent service , excellent food , authentic Mexican , clean and reasonably priced . Very good salsa with fresh cilantro .<->1
A nice place for breakfast , love the avocado toast and green juice . The fresh squeezed juice is amazing !<->1
Happy hour was great - got the tostadas as an appetizer and they were amazing . Good prices and fun atmosphere for games and groups .<->1
Probably my 4th time going to Truffles N Bacon and I have gotten 3 different meals ! Each meal has been far beyond expectations ! ! Place is super good ! !<->1
Delish everything was great , service , food and atmosphere ! We found our new breakfast spot ! Also portions were huge !<->1
The seafood congee was awesome , but remember to ask for less ginger ( cause there s too much ) and add the hot sauce ( not really spicy ) into it , makes it even better .<->1
Love this place from the atmosphere the food the belly dancers everything . Prices are not cheap but that is ok because they keep the place clean and the staff are very friendly<->1
I legit have no words . Why did my pizza look like it was involved in a car crash ? ! Never again .<->0
Cool joint in the heart of liberty village ! The food was amazing and it was a great vibe ... I will be back !<->1
This joint was very delicious . Chicken and waffles were great ! Everyone was also friendly , my first time having them was here in Vegas and I 'll come back ! Perfect for brunch or if you just love chicken and waffles<->1
Joined some friends during restaurant week and had a fabulous meal . Friendly , attentive staff and great food . It is a bit noisy ( small space oddly shaped ) but overall it was wonderful evening !<->1
Great clean fresh food . We have eaten here several times . Line can get backed up , hence lukewarm food - but all in all a decent experience . Four stars because it is rather pricey ...<->1
Came here today . Service has improved immensely . Food is still so so . I like this place . Very relaxing environment . 7 or of 10 would recommend .<->1
Hole in the wall restaurant that picks a punch with great noodle / pasta dishes . My favorite has been the " Sweet Georgia Brown " Mac and cheese with smoked Gouda and topped with popcorn chicken !<->1
FIG FLATBREAD - - crisp oven - fired crust -- very satisfying combination of braised onions , mission figs , prosciutto , arugula , vinaigretteLOFTY SPACE -- clean design , not too hipster - noisy<->1
Went for Thanksgiving dinner and really enjoyed it . Excellent service and meal . Reviewed the regular menu and can not wait to return to try that . Broad menu , interesting wines and a nice dining room . I will be back .<->1
Absolutely love this place ! I have been eating breakfast here for quite a few years and am always taken care of ! I always sit with Leah or cris and they are great waitress thanks for your great service<->1
First time ordering pizza and wings , wings were great 5 star , the pizza toppings were good , the pizza dough ( 3 star ) was soggy towards the center . Might try again<->1
Good for a quiet lunch . The wedge is decent . The patio is nice and prices are reasonable . For dinner , the downtown location has better food and atmosphere .<->2
One of my favorites place for HK style cafe . They got good value lunch specials and an excellent selection . It is often packed at lunch times .<->1
Good food like the chicken chow mein . Go for more spicy than you are use to . Com paired to others there spicy is a little milder .<->1
Went here with my family and they have a HUGE selection of food and alcoholic beverages . Yes , alcohol comes with the buffet . Definitely recommending this place<->1
Service was great as usual , Thanks Marlene ! New chef burned all the food ! Not so good !<->0
My favourite one of all the Terroni locations . Big , beautiful space and great service ! The food at any Terroni location is consistently very good but I ca n't say the same about the service and space .<->1
Absolute best BWW in the valley . The service and consistency of quality has made me a regular . Phenomenal ServiceGreat and large variety of food<->1
One of my favorite weekend spots in Charlotte to visit , enjoy a draft or two and some great authentic Irish food . Caitlin is the best ! She is very attentive , always makes some great recommendations on both food and drink .<->1
Prices are a little high compared to other places , although it 's pretty reasonable because their sauces are exceptional . I do n't really like the starters though , because their katsu is so much better<->1
Finally open again . Excellent food and service . Do n't believe the stories that they are closed forever - they 're not . Open and delicious .<->1
I finally got to try this place thanks to their Sunday lunches for February . Our meal was very good . Wonderfully fresh and flavorful . Very nice service too ! I wish I could make it for Wednesday 's lunches .<->1
Decent service . Not super friendly . Coffee was pretty good , not amazing by any means . It 's a comfortable place to meet with friends and chat . Good atmosphere .<->2
The chicken nuggets bought today are all soft . I buy many times . Today is the worst and I 'm not happy .<->2
When it comes to Asian food I 'm very spoiled living in the Bay Area . The crispy , salt and pepper calamari , was n't . The roasted duck noodle soup was actually pretty good . The service was ok .<->0
Déjeuné OK , rien de super spécial mais bon ...<->2
Great new place for before or after a movie . Loved the chicken kabobs and the falafel .<->1
OSHA is def one of the better Thai restaurants in Scottsdale . The Thai iced tea is the best I 've had since my friends aunt made it from scratch .<->1
A friend of mine who likes spicy food introduced me to this restaurant . I enjoyed the food , but the service was very unsatisfactory .<->0
Like their breakfast . Lunch and dinner not so much . They have always overcooked my entree .<->2
This place is unbelievable ! Great home cooking at yesterday 's prices . Try the hot turkey sandwich .<->1
Get . The . Brussel . Sprouts ! ! ! They were amazing ! I had the vegan pho , which was delightful . The service was amazing , especially for how busy the small restaurant was . We will definitely return !<->1
I love subway ! This location had a great young lady working ... I went in with am order of 24 sandwiches ... She was great ! !<->1
I had the # 34 chili cheese steak sandwich mmmmm most delicious wit sweet potato fries .. I sure will b coming back when I stay out here in Vegas . .. going to try out the whole menu .. lol<->1
This place was amazing , a little off of my gf and I 's beaten path , but well definitely come back any chance we get ! Food was delish ! !<->1
The peach is amazing ! It 's like a super ripe , delicious , amazing peach . The pineapple is seriously good .<->1
The food is pretty good here but the service is terrible . Sushi Legend at Leslie and finch is better = ]<->2
We were visiting Phoenix for Dodger Spring Training 2016 and wanted to have a nice steak . After searching yelp for meat shops , we came across The Meat Shop . Well we were n't disappointed ! All the steaks we purchased tasted great ! !<->1
It was decent food . They take some chances on the pizza . I like that they take chances on flavor pairings and create some really interesting flavor layers .<->2
This place is so yummy . It had fast service and decent prices ! Great date night spot .<->1
We used to eat hear 3 times a week the service is now terrible . We just walked out and went to California pizza kitchen<->0
My girlfriend and I have eaten here twice and we both love it . Very attentive and friendly staff , amazing food !<->1
Long wait but well worth it . The juice is freshly squeezed and the eggs Benedict is to die for !<->1
I was happily surprised by the value and quality for the price of this local restaurant . Apart from the classic California rolls and such , you can have really well made traditional sushi with lots of choice of fish or seafood .<->1
This place is amazing from customer service to the delicious food they serve , I recommend their lasagna , will be back for more !<->1
The cocktails were fine . The service was slow . The food was mediocre . I came , I saw , I left hungry ( and out $ 100.00 ) .<->0
So happy to find an such an amazing Italian restaurant on this side of town . I expect that before long they 'll require reservations , once this secret gem of a café is discovered !<->1
Absolutely loved it ! Thankful for the staff . Payton was amazing , by staying on top of the reservations . Could n't thank you enough . Service , Food & atmosphere was amazing !<->1
Excellent dinner . Salad bar could use a little upgrade though , let 's be honest , you 're there for the meat . Hot , succulent and plentiful . Great assortment . Favourite of the night : pork !<->1
Their staff was friendly , the food was great , our order was correct , reasonably priced and delivery was quick . We will order again .<->1
Best BBQ in Town ! Generous portions , and excellent house bbq sauce .<->1
The time to get the food was slower than a previous experience but the food was FANTASTIC ! !<->1
The drinks were yummy , and pretty strong ! They are extremely sweet , but what you would expect from a candy store . My husband and I shared a 60 oz drink and it was plenty !<->1
Love the corn fritters here ! ! ! Good Coke . Cajun fries are bomb . Po boy is good too ! Smaller atmosphere . Not really any plates or silverware so pretty messy . But the seafood is good<->1
Loved their ramen ! We had the clam broth shoyu ramen and Gyozas and it was delicious . Fast service , friendly staff and good food ! ! ! Will be back again<->1
Excellent and Superior service with a table of 8 . The food was piping hot , served quickly and was delicious . Can not wait to return .<->1
AMAZING food ! The large pretzel is perfect with a beer at anytime of the day . Service is attentive , fast and very friendly ; especially Brent !<->1
it 's good -- but definitely not as good as boiling crab . plus maybe it was just the waitress we had but service really sucked and our waitress gave us attitude and kept messing up our order .<->2
This place is huge . My 4 year old thought it was pretty fun but my 18 month old did n't care for it too much . Staff was friendly . Clean facility !<->1
To make it simple they are as authentic as del taco I agree with don and jasmine<->0
Authentic Mexican tacos ( I consider myself a bit of a connoisseur ) ... and you ca n't beat the prices . Right outside of Charlies Night Club , off the light rail with easy access . Yum , yum , yummy .<->1
The taste is awesome . We had Swiss melt ( $ 8.5 ) & Hogtwon ( $ 11 ) both are juicy and delicious .<->1
Beaux choix de salades à emporter maison de chocolats de qualité avec une terrasse confortable . Station Bixi juste en face<->1
It 's about time Henderson got a BBQ place that is authentic and almost tastes like you are from back in TX / OK . Love Tuckys . My family does as well . They are a little pricey but well worth it .<->1
Great place . Nice prices during happy hours . I love their deserts and seafoods . Services are great too . I really like the atmosphere . They have great design<->1
Soggy bottom , that 's the ultimate no no in my pizza loving eyes . The sauce , toppings . Everything else was good , New York style , tons of cheese . The soggy bottom completely ruined it though .<->0
Excellent food . Excellent service . Chocolate Italian ice is THE BEST ! Try it , you 'll like it .<->1
This is the slowest fast food in the Pittsburgh area . Love Taco Bell food , but it really has a management problem . I would leave , but once ur in their drivethru ur stuck . I feel kidnapped - being held against my will !<->0
The best pho / vietnamness restaurant in GTA , fresh ingredients and soup base are always ON POINT . Must try !<->1
Trio is our go to place to hang out and sheesha . Very cool ambience and the owner along with the entire staff is is very friendly and welcoming . Their Kofta wrap is a must try .<->1
I walked in and the workers walked past me and never greeted our party . I had to finally ask to get help . Then I find out the all you can eat is limited to one hr . Not worth my time .<->0
Cute and fun ! Staff is the typical coffee staff they are somewhat chatty with regulars and cold to those who venture in . Overall cute , bring friends and a good laugh . Support local coffee houses .<->1
Excellent customer service . Very clean . Fast . Delicious chicken pho . Must try it , a bit different than most phos . Shrimp spring roll is good too , but simple .<->1
Good food for Japanese style , but unacceptably slow service . They had one server working the restaurant during the 6:30 pm rush on a Thursday night<->0
After visiting the Leonard Cohen exhibition , we had a nice lunch here . The food is yummy , and staff are very nice and helpful . We would like to come back and try the dinner in future .<->1
We from Detroit and was looking all over for a real coney spot and we found it ... food was great and they had Faygo Pop and better maid chips hopefully they can put one in Goodyear Arizona Love it<->1
I 'm from Utah where there are practically soda shops on every corner . This is a welcomed addition to Henderson and they do it right . The cookies are all wonderful and they have a great secret menu .<->1
Stopped in for a quick dinner . Had the Sushi Combo 2 for $ 18 , with a spicy tuna roll . Felt it was just alright , nothing terrible but I would n't want to order it again . service was great though .<->0
Not horrific , not the transcendental experience I expected based on their press , the fries were dry and floury in texture and the burger looked like it came out of a frozen pack although it was tasty .<->0
Their iced tea is amazing ! Many flavor options at a great price , make sure to add an orange slice !<->1
I love the natural beauty of the restaurants location . Services was excellent and food was great . Small portions but my waistline appreciates that .<->1
This place has a great owner and staff ! So friendly and the food is delicious . Fresh squeezed orange juice , can never go wrong ! Celebrated my brothers birthday breakfast here ! Worth a 20 min drive for us !<->1
Great experience . Staff is friendly and helpful . Food is not too expensive compared to commercial theatres<->1
Damn ! This taco truck is the bomb ! Came for the first time with my wife and we wanted to try everything on their menu . So good ! Spreading the word .<->1
A great place to watch the game but if they are busy ( Sundays during football season ) you have to get there extremely early to find a seat , otherwise forget about it .<->1
I have been going here for 20 years and it has always been fantastic . This has always been one of my favorites with amazing food and great service .<->1
If you are looking for a sub definitely go to Bob 's sub . I 've been getting the junior ( medium 9 ' ' ) . It fills me up for the most part . Nice atmosphere and a college town favorite .<->1
I had heard a lot of good things about JPH so I checked out . I was disappointed . It was dirty and dreary , the food was sub - par and overpriced . Sorry friends , I wo n't bother to return !<->0
A big shout out to Ben and his counterpart for tackling a big group order immediately following opening after a wedding on Sunday . Just as good as these alumni remembered !<->1
Delicious iced coffee , and something that looks amazing called an espresso spritzer . Will try that next time . Great vibe - - between pijo and hipster , but on neither end of that spectrum .<->1
This place was way better than expected . Staff is friendly . Had the chicken pad Thai and my wife had the shrimp pad Thai , and we both shared a wonton soup . Food was amazing . Will definitely be returning and recommending .<->1
Mid afternoon sandwich - green chile turkey Reuben - and coffee . A / C inside , shaded patio outside with lots of greenery . Arizona lifestyle as it should be , short the swimming pool for summer , of course<->1
The place looks cool and chilled , the food also looks good but taste not as good as what it looks , also i must say a little pricy .<->2
CLOSED ! ! ! Invalid number ! No longer open ! Website still up with no contact info . Google map links you to a strip mall and an Indian grocery . BS<->0
Came here when they first open and have been here many times now . the pad thai vegetarian is the best I ve ever had . My wife tries different dishes and has not been disappointed . Super service everytime .<->1
Such a great restaurant ! Love the atmosphere , food , and service . Michael is the best waiter and really helped make our ladies dinner extra special . The desserts are served in such a fun way . Highly recommend it ! ! !<->1
Pretty good pharmacy with a big variation of products , the prices are good and if you have the walgreens card you alwalys get a discount . Perfect for a last minute item .<->1
I love the food and service is amazing . You will never see anyone without a smile on .<->1
thursday should be a national holiday ! seriously ... $ 1.00 hotdogs ( and they are awesome ) ... cheap beer and interesting people . smoking patio and jukebox . i do nt ask for much ... so this place makes me happy . great bartender ( lisa ) too . just saying .<->1
drive through quickly at 10:30 in the morning . I got an expensive sandwich , it taste like a day old the cheese was hard and around the edges , bun old and hard .<->0
Here is a fantastic traditional cappuccino gem in Vegas ! Service was super friendly . Clean place . Make the trip is worth it !<->1
I love the place , cheap prices , yet fresh food . Tasty chicken and broccoli<->1
I really like this place . Great food , great beer and sadly , a great distance from my house ! ! Open one in Scottsdale ! !<->1
? ? ? Ann ? ? ? ! ?<->1
Nastiest food ever .. all food looked really bad , orange chicken was over cooked . Will never step foot in there again . The restroom looked nicer than their food . If I could I would rate this restaurant 0 stars .<->0
Great quick eatery . Love the chicken pita ! Friendly staff . Recommend to anyone looking for great rotisserie style food .<->1
best restaurant around this area ! I love their crab cakes my waitress Michael was very attentive with my refills , the management seems ti know what they 're doing<->1
Love the pizza here . great taste for a low price . The staff is friendly and the service is quick . Would definitely recommend .<->1
This place is Korean . Stay away from beef Tataki . One of the worst . Got spicy Salmon don . Its hwae Dae bop . Decent place if they more known as Korean . Atmosphere trendy<->2
After eating here 4 - 5 times I can only give it 5 stars . Best Ramen in Las Vegas so far !<->1
Just discover these guys , great deep dish pizza , true Chicago style . Only thing that could have done to get 5 stars would be to have more toppings on the pizza .<->1
Wow ! The best Italian restaurant in Vegas for sure ! Recommend getting at least a half pasta order to at least try the spaghetti with tomato basil dish .<->1
Delish carne asada burritos ! Came here for a quick lunch and was blown away by the flavor . If they had one of these places where I live , I 'd be fat in no time .<->1
We just finished a late breakfast here at Dirty Fork and it was really good . Both of us loved our dishes . Croissant egg and bacon sammie and Belgium waffle .<->1
My favourite pho and bun ( noodles with stuff on top ) place ! The owner is super friendly , service is fast , food is really good . My favourite is the 319 . And the kids love the chicken noodle soup .<->1
You guys should change your yelp times ! Came all the way here for nothing ! It says closes at 1 am on here but they close at 11 pm . Smh !<->0
I feel like this place is a hidden gem . It 's really yummy , fresh food . I especially like the enchiladas , which usually is n't my first choice at Mexican restaurants , but they are so good here . Get them with green sauce .<->1
Do n't ever go there . Drinks not good music it not good either that place do n't even deserves a one star<->0
I 've only ever tried their fries , and I have to say not the best . Too soft . A fry should not flop down , it should stand to attention , like an erect penis !<->0
I 've tried every fish dish on the menu at least once , some several times , always good . The Won Ton soup is delicious . Family owned eatery with nice owners .<->1
Great Thai . Quick and easy and really really good food ! Service is great and very pleasant . Careful with how spicy the dishes are . A number 4 or 5 is already VERY spicy .<->1
Had always wanted to try this place ! Delicious food but do n't be in a hurry it did take a a while to get our appetizers and main meal .<->1
The place has changed since I last went here . Great improvement . Awesome staff ! ! The beef teriyaki was great and their orange chicken was heavenly .<->1
Never dissipated by the service or food here . Thank you Will for the outstanding service today .<->1
My husband is sensitive to gluten . So lucky we found this place . The food and service are awesome ! ! !<->1
Cupcakes are fantastic , always fresh , iced right there on the spot , and made to order ! Any combination your heart desires . My fav : chocolate oreo with cream cheese icing :)<->1
Pizza is really average might as well get papa johns across the street for the price<->0
Great selection on the menu . You may dine inside or out . Service was great . Chick 's in the Blanket was excellent . Bloody Mary 's were delicious . We will be going back .<->1
Sorry but this is overpriced and does n't taste very well . Toppers down the street is so much better . The proportions were small , too .<->0
Me and my friend stopped here after work . She had forgot about the place . We really enjoyed the Bianca pizza and the fried calamari were good . Next time we will try another pizza .<->1
It 's alright . A convenient place to grab sushi before heading down to the lake or the garden which is located nearby .<->1
Went there for the pencil party and had an amazing experience . The food was amazing and service was awesome .<->1
Great waffles and coffee . Only complaint is that it is not very noticeable from street . Passed this place a dozen times and never noticed it .<->1
You get what you pay for . Cheap food at a cheap price . Ca n't complain but do n't expect anything amazing .<->2
Best place ever .. food .. service .. patio ... live music ! ! ! Highly highly recommend ! ! ! 6 stars ! ! !<->1
Great helpful staff that provided us w a taste of each meat . All orders are custom made to your liking . Flavorful meats . Delicious entrees . This will be my go - to place for all my taco cravings !<->1
Not worth it ! It 's pricey . The selection is not that big of a variety . And they add very little to the bowl even tho you can over flow it !<->0
Horrible experience . Waited 2 hours for Soggy food and sent it back because of it . Getting a partial refund hopefully soon . This is ridiculous ! ! ! What a waste of time and money ! Ordering out is supposed to be easy<->0
Had a quick lunch at this pasta place , 3 adults and 2 children . Ordered salads , pasta , bruschetta , and dessert . Food was good , service was friendly .<->1
My new favorite hookah place ! Everyone is friendly , hookah is smooth , a ton of flavors to choose from , music is nice , couches are comfy , over all atmosphere is perfect ! Skittles and orangecicle are my favs<->1
This place is wonderful . It has a different feel then the deer valley location but both locations are equally awesome .<->1
Excellent value for the money . Fairly inexpensive , good quality food . $ 1 beers on Sunday is a plus .<->1
Went here based on the reviews so I 'd thought I should give this a try . Tried the steak burrito and the steak was not really steak ... its more like shredded steak which taste totally different from a real steak burrito ...<->0
Our party of 4 had a terrific brunch . The service was top notch , and the green chili was very good . The Bloody Mary was better than most .<->1
I paid 30 dollars for 9 ravioli 's and a very small disgusting sandwich . Customer service was below average and not very helpful . I will not be coming back .<->0
A must on every trip to Vegas and with one in the aria , maybe we 'll go more often .<->1
All the meats . Lovely service in a stunning atmosphere ! Best date night for those who appreciate the butchers cut !<->1
Totally amazing ! ! ! I love curry and this si definitely the place to eat it at . Perfect level of spiciness engulfed in creamy yet mild coconut flavor . I will definitely be back<->1
unique flavors , excellent owners , prime location . nothing but great things to say about this place !<->1
Lousy drive - thru , expensive for what you get . Extremely oily had to throw out half the sandwich . I 'm from LA and this is not the best<->0
Love this place ... They have the best fruits ... Really sweet and less expensive too ! ! !<->1
A damn tasty Italian restaurant . The portions are all pretty large , and quite well constructed . Good for friends and family to get together and enjoy a good , comparatively cheap dinner .<->1
Good service , very good guacamole and the fish tacos were tasty . I give them 3 stars only because I found their portions stingy . The shrimp tacos had only one shrimp .<->2
This little gem was tucked away off Rainbow on Russell ... we had lunch , played checkers and ate a delightful grilled cheese panini<->1
Not the best shawarma in Toronto , better than the one across the street , it passes for a shawarma , and its pretty filling but , SUPER SLOW SERVICE . If you 're in a rush do n't bother .. Try McDonald 's lol<->2
I have sleepless nights craving that deep dish crust . Changed my flight and took a day off of work , so I can stay on Monday for half - off .<->1
I LOVE Squarz ! I have been buying at the Roadrunner Farmer 's Market for awhile now and I 'm so excited to see they have an actual cafe now ! The Lentil Curry and Spinach & Feta are my favorites !<->1
Top notch menu , wine and service . Rich , almost exotic Italian dishes in tapas format . Very good wine list .<->1
Had double date tonight , service was good but the food was awful . Burnt veggies and dry dry meat . Was n't worth the $ 40 + entree price . Not recommended<->0
Well hello there ginger shots ! ! ! These are n't on their normal menu . These shots are hard core and fabulous ! ! ! I 'm kind of obsessed on how amazing they have made me feel . Viva la ginger ! !<->1
The food was very good and reasonably priced . Our group of 6 all had different sandwiches , and everyone was happy .<->1
Love their poke bowls , edamame , the drinks , the atmosphere and the decor ! Service is also always great .<->1
Delicious ! Food was fresh and very friendly service . I recommend this place to anyone looking for a tasty meal to enjoy at any time during the day !<->1
Go and try out their SOY MILK , MANGO & LYCHEE smoothie . It is $ 4.50 for a small including tax . It is amazing and will burst your tastebuds !<->1
Highly recommend the surf ' n ' turf ! Mussels and calamari are great too . The sangria is delicious and has a good amount of booze . The live music makes for a fun atmosphere ! ! !<->1
First time ordering . We had a pizza ( half V 's 3 meat / half bianco ) wings and garlic knots and everything was really good . We will order again for sure !<->1
Went here for brunch / lunch . The prime rib was pretty good , crab legs passable . Everything else standard buffet fare . Macaroons also quite delecious . Pretty good overall for the price . Great dessert selection .<->1
One of my favorite lowkey sushi spots . Fast and friendly service , great quality food and affordable prices . Ca n't really ask for much more .<->1
Cozy place , friendly cool atmosphere , and the most delicious snacks ! ! ! Would definitely go back<->1
The Kolaches are so delicious and I highly recommend checking this place out . The donuts are also very tasty and fresh . I have been there several times and will be back for more !<->1
Love coming here food is great always have Carlos wait on me he is a sweetheart . Nice and clean a + + +<->1
Great place to grab a bite . Everyone is friendly , great food and service . We split to the jalapeño poppers and the pretzel dog with the Mac and cheese . They also have a great selection of craft beers<->1
New to the Mountains Edge area and finally found an awesome restaurant to relax in , or grab a cocktail with friends . Check out Oyshi Sushi for an all you can eat , great service and knowledgeable sushi chefs .<->1
Great margarita , great salsa , great elotes . Had the chiles en nogada . Was so so so good !<->1
My new favorite Indian resto in Toronto ... Food was top notch , deft hand with the spices , generous portions . Shall definitely return !<->1
Filthy and terrible customer service . Every order has always been wrong . This place is terrible . Quality is horrible . Everything tastes stale and old . Thanks for wasting my time .<->0
We stayed for happy hour and got a selection of small plates . Calamari , veggie lettuce wraps , California roll and crab wontons . Cocktails were good and well priced . The food was OK .<->2
My colleagues and I come here on a regular basis . Great staff and great food . They treat there customers like gold . Highly recommend adding this spot to your list !<->1
Now this an extraordinarily over - priced restaurant ... that is completely worth every penny / benjamin . Great service as well ! The royal treatment !<->1
OXTAIL . PHO . I make it at home but I 've never found a restaurant that does ! Soooooo good . I 'm coming here from now on !<->1
Thank you , Garcia 's , for acknowledging my review and offering process improvement . My husband and I frequent your restaurant on a weekly basis and love the food and the service . Thanks for your quick response to correct my concern !<->1
Amazing selection . Great use of different flavours for every item . Amazing sashimi and sashimi , very high quality and fresh . Presentation great , servers are friendly and helpful . Within my top two places for sushi in calgary<->1
Affordable price with generous portionsAlways eating their poutine thereGood place for students<->1
For Chinese Food , their food selection is on the simpler side but the restaurant is clean , spacious and good for a larger group . Food was pretty good . Considering it 's on yonge - bloor , good enough for me<->1
great food ! ! ! new , clean restaurantfriendly enough staffall u can drink bomb strawberry limeade . . all at great prices ! ! ! we were thouroughly satisfied on our 1st visit to Habit - will def be returning ! ! !<->1
discovered this place by chance , the food taste like home cooked . the service is great and the food is delicious .<->1
Cupcakes were okay , definitely not the best that I have had in the valley ( nothing compares to Caketini ) . Service was decent ! Definitely fixed my sweet tooth .<->1
Perfect in every way . Simple plates , amazingly prepared . If you do n't try this place , you all sorts of crazy .<->1
Decent happy hour . Good portions and pretty tasty . Limited seating & wait staff but still pretty quick service . We 'll come back again but with a smaller party .<->1
Prices are a bit high but the food is great and the shows are fun !<->1
Great bbq and sauce selection . Good for families and not very expensive for bbq . The employees were friendly and courteous . You order at a counter but they bring it to you .<->1
Delivery in 25 minutes ! Super quick and easy . The spinich , feta cheese bread is awesome .<->1
Came here for lunch and it was a bit pricey . The portion was so - so , they forgot to add the meat with my bibimbop !<->0
We were there the first time for lunch . Nice ambience . Food was excellent . Coconut milk based soup was awesome . I am sure to pay them a visit again soon .<->1
Great food , fast delivery . Polite delivery guy . I 'll use them again . Great Mu Shoo . The food was still hot when it arrived .<->1
Best bbq I 've had in a long time . Great portion sizes . Service was great . Worth the 40 minute drive . If we lived closer this would be our hang out .<->1
This place is OK . It has a decent selection of Asian produce and fresh foods , as well as frozen and canned . Good if you need basic Asian grocery supplies .<->2
Had a great experience here earlier today . Brought my dog on the patio and Andrew was very accommodating with water bowls . The short rib tostado is amazing as well . Will definitely be back<->1
Tastes like straight up garbage . Do n't do it . They should be out of business . The udon and chow mein tastes really funky .<->0
Love this place ! It used to be Fullers & I still refer to it as that . Owner is friendly and usually tending bar . Great karaoke and cheap brews .<->1
They have meat , beer and garbage bags all for sale at the same place ! ! ! the ONLY reason its not getting 5 stars is because they sell vegetables here too .<->1
Cappuccino is great . If you are not used to coffee , be careful . The coffee is strong and can shock you ! I liked the place a lot and coffee too . Some cookies are fresh and nice too .<->1
Ok I have to say once again exceptional ! Spot on with service , the ambience and mostly , the food . I have my favorites but every time we go we try something different .<->1
Worst place ever ! The help was using a dirty rag to clean around the trays and was touching the food with the dirty rag . Feel sick now . Gross !<->0
I alwsys enjoy dining at Olives if i 'm staying at the Bellagio . Excellent views , excellent food , and great service . What more can one want ?<->1
Salut is super good ! Fresh , well - made food , yummy drinks , and a pleasant ambiance . Their lemon lavender fizz drink is quite good . I ca n't wait to go back and try more of their food ! I would definitely recommend this place .<->1
Why did you just charge me $ 4.25 for a regular 8.4 oz can of rebel ? Is n't a 16 oz rebel drink $ 3.50 ? I think you overcharged me on this one .<->0
Absolutely fabulous ! Ca n't say enough about our server Esther ! We asked her for help with the menu and her suggestions were spot on ! Very generous portions . Will visit again and again . Excellent ! !<->1
Delicious food ; clean , friendly environment ; and sustainable products . What more can you ask for ?<->1
Food was ok , but burger was SUPER greasy . Dessert ( chocolate peanut butter pretzel pie ) was delicious .<->1
Great food . The outdoor eating area is dog friendly . Try the shrimp and pulled pork . Been there 15 times and never disappointed . Had lunch there on my wedding day !<->1
This is the best bakery I have ever been to ! Alcohol filled truffles ? ! The Debbie Double Mint was my favorite . I would definitely recommend coming here next time to satisfy the " sweet tooth " . Cute gift ideas also .<->1
Food was great ! Service was a little off , might have been the waitresses first night . But overall great sushi ! Have n't tried the Chinese or noodles yet but want to ! !<->1
it was n't bad , but I thought it was pretty pricey for average food . Our waiter was very friendly , but I just do n't think it 's worth going back on our limited budget .<->0
Still my favorite Chinese restaurant , especially since they put up with all my picky requests :D If I could give them more stars I would , but I ca n't , so I 'll settle for giving them more money .<->1
All of our rolls were delicious and full of flavor , our favorite roll was the Baja roll ... The staff was more than outstanding . Would highly recommend<->1
Do everything here , but take - out for lunch . See Mary - Beth inside at the bar ; she rocks . Dining inside is always a pleasure ; also , before 6 there are great " happy hour " specials ...<->1
I was soooo hoping for better , being from the Bay Area in California .. But it was just " alright " .. I 'm a huge fan of tomato bisque soup , and it was just so - so .. So was my turkey pesto sandwich ..<->2
This place is the bomb ! its great juicy chicken , delicious rissois , amazing piri piri sauce . Always great service with a smile and good value . I wish they would accept credit cards and not cash only .<->1
Food was bad and cold . I ordered a quiche . There was trash and used cups and empty chip wrappers on the floor .<->0
Chorizo tacos were amazing ! I would definite hit this place up when I 'm back in town . I like how you can see them prepare everything right in front of you .<->1
I would say give - 1 star most pathetic food . service was worst never take the buffet u wait for the food in the queue and they reheat the food nothing was fresh ! ! Meat smells bad never go<->0
Amazing food and good value . The portions are large and the food is delicious ! I would recommend the all day breakfast !<->1
Great causal Mexican food . Better than Chipotle IMO . Decent price , good selection , lots of variety .<->1
Fantastic food and amazing service ! ! Bartenders know their drinks and know the menu . I would recommend this place to anyone ! !<->1
Was pleasantly surprised . Friendly customer service . Great food . Family friendly ambience .<->1
All my food was wrong and ice cold . The website makes it impossible to complain and no one answers the phone when I call . I did n't even special order anything , So upset<->0
Consistently good fresh food . I love their rice , chicken and corn salsa , especially . The grandkids area always happy with a trip to Chipotle , too ! It 's a favorite easy family spot .<->1
This is the worst spicy pepper steak bowl I have ever had . Way to fatty for me . The rice was what I had for lunch today<->0
Best Thai place in Tempe . Great food , nice staff , and a nice atmosphere . I love this place and eat there all the time . Very vegetarian friendly . I recommend the papaya salad and pad pak .<->1
AMAZING PLACE and the portions of the plates are great ! Definitely recommend and also recommend the DevilEggs .<->1
So much space to sit , very friendly and helpful staff . A really yummy sandwich and lots of options . I enjoyed relaxing at a table and eating a flavourful and filling sub .<->1
Best wing spot . Love the customer service as well . Never disappointed with this place ! ! !<->1
Few places can match delfalcos , only down side is they can get backedup . We have not gotten any sub par food after many visits .<->1
Awesome ribs - go for the spicy BBQ sauce , it 's not that hot and I 'm a lightweight . Friendly fast service .<->1
I used JC 's for a party i had recently . The food was INCREDIBLE ! Everything was on time and totally taken care of . The staff was friendly and helpful . I would absolutely recommend JC 's to anyone that wants a great experience ! !<->1
Probably the best poke place I 've tried ! Fresh ingredients and impeccable service , what more could you ask for ! 10/10 would recommend and come again !<->1
Speedy delivery of great food ! I really like their cheesy wootons . If you want chopsticks you must request them .<->1
Great food . Open late downtown . Get the Ruben .<->1
Charming little neighborhood coffee shop with friendly service , tasty food and great prices . Forget about the coffee chains and support unique , small businesses like Nostalgia ! Will definitely be back !<->1
Do n't eat there for Thanksgiving . They just reheat prior cooked food . It was an awful dining experience and the service was horrible . The waiter completely forgot to bring our desserts , which we had to remind him about .<->0
Loved this place very authentic Italian pizzeria ca n't wait to take my boyfriend here !<->1
DO NO GO HEREBeer does not have price on menu . Thus , they secretly charge you $ 10 per warm beer . Waiter was rude and had to search for someone to get my check from .<->0
Not the best I have had from Thai Express . Lacks flavour and spice . Plus I ordered from the discovery menu and I was charged at regular price .<->2
This is probably one of my favorite restaurants on the Danforth . Service is always excellent , food is plentiful , fresh and delicious . The Korean fried chicken , amazing . Price , completely reasonable .<->1
Good stuff ! The steak quesadillas was delicious , I m not a big fan of Mexican food but this place was good .<->1
That s my sunday place ! ! hmmmm Black forest with my cafe latte.very pleasant ambiance and french music so i do sing when i go there ! ! !<->1
Love love love 2 - 1 Mondays and Carl ! Never eaten there but it looks delicious ... Karaoke night is always an experience . Def recommend this bar .<->1
Had Buffalo Chicken sandwich , it was not that bad . My friend ordered chicken tenders , it was horrible . Good place for people who had drinking . Nice environment .<->0
Good and cheap so that 's a winner for me ! This is my go - to pho place . They have a XL pho bowl and a variety of other dishes . I 've enjoyed everything I 've tried here .<->1
The lamb special was cooked and seasoned perfectly . The lobster macaroni and cheese was ideal confort food . The short rib pizza flavor was ridiculously good .<->1
Everything was big and delicious should come here . Had the BLT and my wife had the Chicken pot pie . Beautiful presentation ! Reasonable prices and huge portions . Will definitely come back !<->1
Attended a Party with this Service and was well impressed by the fish Food and the great Service !<->1

Just always an incredible dining experience and incredible food . Ca n't say enough great thing about Lawry 's .<->1
Great food . Great service . Good variety for the whole family . Fully stocked bar and a nice selection of wines . Homemade sausage lentil soup is my personal favorite .<->1
Thankfully the reviews warned us of the slow kitchen and service . We arrive 2 hours before the show and had to have dessert delivered into the concert ... but the food was good ! The music awesome !<->1
We just love this place . Wee got the Halibut for the first time and it was incredible . Love the beef shoulder , green chili stew and the eggs !<->1
Screwed up my order again . For the number of employees there you would think they will get a simple order right . They even miss the drink !<->0
This place is authentic and great Mexican food . The best part is the service . You will be well attended and the perfect place for food !<->1
Looking forward to them reopening ! As of today , their voicemail says they 're still closed from the fire .<->1
Chiptole ... enough saidgreat mexican for being americanized chain ... massive burrito for $ 8<->1

Excellent food and great service . Very friendly staff ! Reasonably priced . Lived that they offer breakfast lunch and dinner at anytime of the day .<->1
I love Thrifty ice cream . My favorite flavors are black cherry and mint chip circus animal cookies<->1
always delicious , always fresh ! they never disappoint . best place in vegas to get fresh poke !<->1
I really like their hot coco :) but their staff is crazy chipper . Like , dude . It 's 4 am . Stop this smiling and " have a good day " stuff . I ca n't handle this right now .<->1
The location is great and the food is awesome . There is nothing better than fried chicken at a gas station , the tea is amazing and the service was great . $ 5 meal box is the way to go .<->1
Awesome wings , they are spicy but not painful ; I want to try more items next time I 'm near !<->1
Great food and service ! My kids and husband loved their food and we will certainly go back since it KS some of the best thai food we have had ! ! ! Our server ( Apple ) was great and cordial . Ca n't go wrong here ! !<->1
The drink consistency at this Starbucks is probably the best I 've ever had ... The only downside to this one is the lack of seating ; it always seems to be busy whenever I go there .<->1
Stopped in for breakfast 07/26 / 2015 , owner said " We 're not open . Just having a going away ceremony . " Contrary to other reviews , he was quite pleasant with us . However , it had the feel like he was going out of business .<->0
Awesome food , awesome service , I m not sure about the location , definitely will eat here again<->1
Enjoyable experience .. This is the place to go for a classic old Vegas feel . The food was great and the portions were enormous ... Open 24/7 , so ya ca n't go wrong<->1
The cupcakes are always fresh and yummy and the service has always been top notch ! Banana cream pie and chocolate chip cookie dough are my favorite !<->1
this place is surprisingly good . lots of vegetarian options . great prices . good service . worth a trip to the Hood .<->1
Very very delicious ! my friend and I enjoyed there The tea is authentic .<->1
This place is always awesome and services so fastFood 5 stars services 5stars ememployees always nice and knid cool people<->1
This place has excellent atmosphere , friendly staff and roasts their own coffee beans ! Less pretensious than Makers and Finders or Public US . Go here for something a step above your usual Starbucks !<->1
Good HummusPita jungle does n't disappoint with its tasty hummus and pita bread to snack on during a night out with friends or business lunch meeting ... Convenient locations and good service ...<->1
If you are looking for great food , friendly service , and great value then this is your place ! There is one word to describe this place , yummy !<->1
Been to Kings about 6 times now . Have not had one bad meal . We love it here . Service has always been great . You want good food at reasonable prices , come here !<->1
Waited for over 20 minutes for bacon and eggs . By that time my coffee was cold and the English muffin they served was cold . Worst thing is it was 1:40 pm and not crowded at all .<->0
Always get the Buffalo Wings ! ! ! Never disappoints , plus Late - night happy hour ! ! ! Need I say more ? ! ? ! ! !<->1
A very average Korean casual restaurant . The service was quick and friendly . The food was adequate , but in the North York area there are many superior places . The prices are also about average for the area . A very neutral experience .<->2
The meatballs tasted like rubber , the steak tartare was warm , the rice tasted like a deep fryer had n't been cleaned in 7 years . The only good thing we 're the French fries ... but who can mess up french fries ?<->0
This is the one and only great all you can eat ayce Korean BBQ spot . Excellent fast service , clean facility and yummy food ! ! !<->1
Quick update from original review . We still love it but they no longer participate in Restaurant.com<->1
Service is very bad . Waiters are very slow and do nt come over when you ask for some service . Waiters are polite but very slow . Needs work<->0
i wish i could give this place a 6 , because that chocolate shake and truffle fries i had were simply the GREATEST . THING . EVER . pricey . but hey it 's vegas .<->1
Wow I was amazed by how good the steak really was even the seafood so fresh , appetizers , good atmosphere is really nice people working there my favorite waiter , Bruno and Frank the manager A real gentleman<->1
New owners new crazy prices 2 slices and 2 cans of coke $ 12 was in NYC last week 2 slices and a coke $ 5 . The pizza tastes like crap all cheese and bread no sauce at all .<->0
Terrible . $ 10.50 for a worse than fast food style burger with no side . Entire terminal 4 , C gates needs a revamp on employee training<->0
good and cheep for 50 yearsif you go from pete ' s to pete 's east to west or west to east you will see what phoenix loked like in 1955<->1
Great karaoke ! Will be back again ! Love Mariam and what a voice ! Tons of fun and feels right at home .<->1

Food horrible , server sucked , did n't bring napkins or silverware . Food is better at long john silvers<->0
Just incredible food . Great coffee , Great food , and a beautiful seating area . I would strongly recommend this restaurant to anyone .<->1
Pretty good food . I especially enjoyed the octopus and the cauliflower dishes . Ordered both the sangria 's , but they both felt a bit watered down .<->1
Boa opção para um Brunch de domingo ! Só estava cheio qdo fui e serviço foi um pouco lento .<->2
Great place for steaks and seafood in Las Vegas fantastic waiters and service I come every time I come to Vegas five stars<->1
Good food but I have n't been to one of these in nearly 12 years and was pretty excited to go . Traveled way out of my way to get here and I got the one pregnant waitress . OH COME ON !<->1
These guys have outstanding meats great pricing and most of all actual customer service . They are always willing to listen and give great advice on cooking products .<->1
Wir waren in der Woche i m Gasthaus . Das Essen war lecker und die Bedienung freundlichen und einfühlsam . Die Portionen war ausreichend der Preise angemessen .<->1

Best little breakfast / lunch place in Henderson . We have never been disappointed here . Highly recommend any of the breakfast sandwiches . They are the BEST ! Pretty fast delivery too .<->1
Vegan chilli fries on fleek everytime & cauliflower tacos & jackfruit sliders . One of my favorite vegan friendly places . I bring my friends here when they visit from out of town .<->1
The food is great . Our server James was wonderful . We made reservations for the ying yang hot pot and was seated in a timely fashion . I will be returning !<->1
Great little place to eat & always busy . We order Thai food every single Monday for lunch . You ca n't best the prices for the portion sizes .<->1
Best pizza place ever . They have unique pizzas that are absoultly delicious . I 've been to the Danforth location 2 times now and have not been disappointed . Ca n't wait to go back and try another kind of pizza .<->1
This place is horrible Food was okay but their service was really really badThere are lots of all you can eat Korean bbq in Las Vegas Do not come to this place ! !<->0
Very tasty and service was great . We ordered the kafta , a lamb dish and the eggplant ( I forgot the names , sorry ! ) . I wish the serving sizes were a little bit larger . It 's more of a tapas style restaurant<->1
Omg one of my favorite Italian restaurant.the fettuccine is the best.overall the food was amazing.service is good !<->1
Wonderful quality . Being a big BBQ fan I am picky with where I eat . This place surpasses them . Excellent brisket . Wonderful sides . Plethora of sauces . Chill atmosphere . Such a good find !<->1
The owner , Maggie is very sweet . When I walked in , this place was packed with people . I tried the Marion : tomato , mozzarella cheese and pesto . She imports her flour from France . I 'm sure I 'll be back soon ! !<->1
Service slow . Tables dirty . Cool view of the game . Organization getting a bit chaotic . Some Tables are stand only !<->0
Nice atmosphere . The workers are very attentive and nice . Food was awesome . I recommend trying out the Bulgogi Burrito . Would definite recommend this place to friends and family .<->1
This is a fine place for the price . Nothing extraordinary about this food except that it 's rather healthy . My kids love making their own sauce recipe . And ... that 's about it .<->1
Great food and sweet servers . Totally enjoyed our authentic Italian meal . Caprice salad with fresh mozzarella and tomatoes was delicious . A little more money than Olive Garden however 1,000 times better in the taste department .<->1
Great food and great service . This is one of our new favorite spots in Henderson . Not pricy and delicious food .<->1
Food is excellent , good ole home cooking . We shopped afterwards and staff is very friendly !<->1
Honestly .. I came for the NFR ! First time .. Great environment everything was great .. Only thing . THEY NEED MORE RESTROOMS ! ! ! 10 - 15 min wait to get into TWO DAMN STALLS ! ! ! Cmon gilleys ! ! Get it together ! ! !<->0
Was terrible , I ordered burger , for some reason they bring salad ! They are rude ! They do n't care about customers at all .<->0
Great variety of smoothies , clean , and quick . Smoothies are around $ 6 and are very satisfying . I used to drive to Mayfield to get Pulp . So happy that there is now a location in Willoughby .<->1
First time here and is not going to be the last one . Very nice experience , excellent food and service . Special Thank you to Deni are serve for all your help and info .<->1
It 's In - N - Out . Always good , inexpensive , and drive - through line moves steadily . Double - double animal style is my go - to .<->1
Popped in for a quick drink to see what it was all about . Great atmosphere and bar staff was awesome ! Will be back to try the food very soon !<->1
Nice place , good cigars . Purchased an Oliva Serie O cigar . Decent price for a quality cigar . Humidors seem to be well controlled and set . Nice addition to downtown Glendale . Would not hesitate to return .<->1
Horrible store ; associates are not trained , wait time is horrific and processes are inefficient . Avoid at all cost !<->0
My favorite place to get pizza in Pittsburgh ! Great service , quality ingredients and fun relaxed atmosphere ! I would recommend to try the Greenpointer and Jackie ( with egg ! ) Amazing ! Appetizers are really delicious as well !<->1
3 courses . $ 55 Date night .. really lovely . Peaceful setting excellent service , very good food .. and decaf coffee worthy of a second cup . Tiramisu amazing ! ... just the evening we were looking for after a very long day .<->1
When for lunch with a grouo of co workers . The service was excellent . The milkshake was unbelievable ! ! ! The burger was good . Not a fan of the chips / fries . Inwould go back just for the milkshake .<->1
Try the marinated pork chops . I am hungry as I am writing about them . The combination of rice , side salad and pork chops is a good one . And surprisingly they are generous with the portion . Me like it !<->1
My family and I have enjoy eating at this restaurant . This time we decide to order out . The quality of food and presentation does not change because you are ordering to go . Always great service and friendly staff .<->1
Love this place ! Breakfast served all day ! The prices are good and the staff is friendly ! It 's nice to listen to the oldies while eating your food . Do n't forget the chocolate cream pie when you check out .<->1
The margaritas were strong and I LOVE their spinach con queso dip !<->1
This is the best seafood house in las Vegas . the staff is excellent and knowledgeable about the menu I had the soft shell crabs sandwich it was great and the price was reasonable I will be back .<->1
The food was ok , I had the corned beef Benedict . Very busy the service not that good .<->2
It 's just good food . Good bok choy and kimchi , great sauce selections and noodles . My preschooler loves the yakis and my first grader get his own bowl . When I 'm not super hungry the minibowl is a perfect option .<->1
Everything about this place is perfect :) the sushis are fresh and delicious plus the portions compare to the reasonable price are great . Josef , I guess the owner , welcomed us with three different dishes on the house<->1
A very fun wine place in the airport . The various food options are great and go well with the wine ! This is behind the security checkpoint .<->1
Excellent service . Yummy food . Good portion . Highly recommend ! Will come visit again . The meat balls , kalamari , even the rice are so good ! ! !<->1
Nice casual lunch spot . Great food with great prices ! Small / Large sandwiches are 3.99 / 4.99 . Can grab more deli meats for take out !<->1
Great atmosphere , sushi tasted great , and the customer service was excellent ! I recommend sitting at the sushi bar . * order the extra spicy tuna * Will be returning with my wife on many more occasions .<->1
Very good curry . Panama , yellow and mud - sa - mun is fantastic ! Others food to try would be pad Thai and fried rice .<->1
I travel all over the state for work and eat sushi frequently . Otaku has Amazing Sushi at very reasonable prices . Incredible staff and customer service ! Upscale feel , it is my wife 's favorite place for dinner and happy hour .<->1
Love this beer distributor . They always have what I 'm looking for . The workers are extremely nice and always willing to help . Best one I 've seen by far .<->1
Was there tonight to celebrate my wedding anniversary food was amazing excellent service and the staff was awesome . It was our first time but not our last .<->1
This is not real Chinese food . California Pizza Kitchen goes to China .<->2
There is nothing wrong with this Chipotle . I have never had any sort of problem here , or any sub - par food . And I tell you what , an average Chipotle gets 5 stars in my book .<->1
Quick Trip , Quick Trip , Quick Trip ! hooray ! best gas station eva ! Tons of drink options , coffees , slushies , griller food , doughnuts , snacks , tons of beverages , best pricing on gas , clean restrooms , list goes on & on<->1
Our favorite breakfast spot ! The Kale Tonic juice is the best and every meal I 've ever had has been fantastic -- avocado toast , sunrise fruit bowl , potatoes , chia seed power food -- all amazing ! ! Really cute atmosphere too .<->1
My FAVORITE place to eat ! Pork belly bao , pot stickers , Mexican coke ... repeat !<->1
The worst POS 's in Tempe or maybe even East Valley ! Rude employees with bad attitudes ! Poor quality food and sloppily made sandwiches . Avoid at all costs ! !<->0
I 've been here three times . Each time it just keeps on getting better ! On my last visit my only complaint was that I did n't have more room in my belly .<->1
La bière est bonne ! le service est impécable , Mais la nourriture est Ordinaire .. Pour une belle soirée entre amis c'est un endroit idéal .<->1
Very friendly neighborhood bar . Great serviced and awesome ceviche ! I had the lobster macaroni and cheese ! I would highly recommend it<->1
Love this place . Wonderful addition to the neighbourhood . Internet - level prices in a brick - and - mortar storefront any day of the week . Friendly staff too , love the samples .<->1
Some of the best food in downtown ! The poutine was wonderful , great ambience , the bumble bee biscuit was out of this world ! If you 've never been here , you 're cheating yourself<->1
The beer was fresh , had excellent flavor , body , and the food was on - point . All in all , an excellent place to grab some local brews and great food .<->1
Best Mexican food in the east valley ! Prices are decent . Service was awesome .<->1
Great coffee and food ! I highly recommend this coffee shop ! My husband gets chai blended and I get hot mocha or iced caramel macchiato so yummy ! !<->1
I 'm visiting a friend in AZ and was craving Sushi . We placed a take out order and let 's just say its one of the best Sushi places I 've ever had !<->1
Came back and still love it here , one of the best places to eat on the west side . Try the dip trio to start , the spicy feta is fantastic !<->1
Lemon lavender donut was so light & refreshing . Ca n't wait to stop back in with a group of friends so I can try multiple flavors .<->1
My favorite is the Mighty Aphrodite , but it 's seasonal so this time I got one of their new grain bowls with bacon and sriracha and it was awesome !<->1
I love Thai food , but this was n't my favorite . I asked for Medium but it 's was distinctly mild . Probably would n't eat here again<->2
My first time here . Great coffee , awesome atmosphere , and super friendly staff . You do n't need to be a hipster to enjoy this place . Will definitely come back for lunch and hh<->1
Fresh , tasty , healthy food . I loved their garden breakfast with egg white . Great fresh food !<->1
The food has always been good . But it 's still a fast food joint . but I have yet to be disappointed except when I order coconuts there prepared very poorly . But I 'm no hater of the place .<->1
I like the strong tea flavor .. A lot of places you only taste the sweetness but not this ! Yum<->1
Great litrte portions . Love the plating . Dessert bar is to die for ! ! Best Buffet in Vegas !<->1
Outstanding burgers and fantastic shakes . The creative burger combinations are surpassed only by the build your own burger . The unique shakes are both tasty and memorable .<->1
Seems like healthy food , small for the cost , but its the main drag in Scottsdale .<->2
Consistently good Americanos . The berry bars are fabulous and I love the watermelon mint iced tea on a hot afternoon .<->1
MCB is one of the best BBQ places in town . I say " one of the best " because I sometimes find that the meat can be dry . The beans , cole slaw and fried pickles are to die for , though .<->1
wow .. the food hear is unreal . the pizza is fantastic . will def come back when i m in the area !<->1
Great as usual . All locations are great . Authentic tacos are great . Nachos are HUGE ! ! !<->1
Pretty good pizza - kind of New Yorkish with the this crust and lots of cheese . Pricey though .<->1
The food is good and the price is fair . My only complain is that the place was a bit dirty ( our table smelled funny and there was a bit of trash on the floor ) .<->2
Place is pretty simple , cheap and the pizza is nice and oily , but warm out of the oven .<->1
Tried for the first time . It was delicious and the clerk was very courteous . It is a fresh change from chain stores and prices are comparable .<->1
Hot cheap food . No flavour , extremely salty and bland . Textures can be comparable to el dente ramen noodles with a touch of store bought powdered stocks . Pork belly and egg were overcooked . Friendly and polite service . Will not be back .<->0
So sad to see this place taken over by a Jimmy Johns ! This was a good place to eat . Now off to Kumo !<->1
Delicious , great atmosphere . Music is always fun too . Sooo much to order so make you go with an empty tummy and a couple hours to eat everything on the menu .<->1
Great food and service . I love chinese food and instead of wasting money on buffet at asia , you should come here .<->1
We stopped in tonight for take out -- our first time as we 're new to Charlotte . Such good food ! The hot and sour soup is amazing . Husband got the veggie lomein -- full of veggies . So good and fast !<->1
I had the Italian . It came out quickly and was delicious . Service was also great . Highly recommend .<->1
Food was delicious wish they had a wider variety of drinks and some coffee ... besides that everything was great place was very clean and staff was friendly ..<->1
Yum . It was freaking awesome . I had lunch with my boyfriend . Sorry I did n't take pictures of our food . We were really hungry and the food was great .<->1
I came I saw I got the pastrami and it torn it up ! Love this place<->1
Everything seemed bland and generic . No authentic dishes here . The salsa tasted store bought .<->0
Awesome sushi spot with their all you caneat it definitely hits the spot . I tried their halibut sashimi and it was sublime ! Also , do n't forget to order some sake and beers or both to enhance your all you can eat experience .<->1
After traveling to Europe nothing has come close , until now ! the coffe truly has the essence of rich and delicious flavourful coffee only found abroad .<->1
Nice place to get a snack and use the internet . Everything is just a bit pricier and less fresh than if you go to Jean - Talon or Cote des Neiges .<->0
Went to dinner last week the food was excellent and and service will be coming back the location is great wish we have one in south of Calgary than it will be bit closer<->1
Location has improved over the last couple months . Clean and good customer service . The air conditioning is finally fixed and the flies have not been as bad .<->1
Changed owners , fixed if not all , most of my previous complaints . Food is still average - ayce Service is " Chinese " Would n't be my first choice but I 'd come back if brought up .<->2
Quite the assorted choices . Breakfast foods from the gains to the yogurts to the very special eggs with lobster . Danish heaven along with ice cream . So many choices a picky eater could have a lot of choices . Very reasonable .<->1
First visit and had the WORST service I have ever experienced at a Chili 's . Will never go back to this location . Food was mediocre at best .<->0
Labor Day Week 2016 : I experienced a Fat Burger and it was very tasty ! ! The meat is cooked well done if that 's what you prefer yet , not over cooked , well seasoned ! Perfect for after partying ...<->1
SERVICE WAS EXCELLENT AND ATTENTIVEMegan R . Was on Point and was totally suggestive and picked everything right ! I love her service definitely coming back for her !<->1
Beautiful setting on the 15th floor . Excellent food and service . A little pricey , but worth it .<->1
The waitress was so talkative that she messed up my food when it came out . She was so loud when I was trying to order .<->0
Update on last review ... happy to say the wings have come out correctly as ordered and the pizza seems to be better tasting . Yeah !<->2
Ranked among the best pizza I 've ever had . Will stop there on every trip to Vegas . Loved it ! ! !<->1
Delicious ! Ordered pizza , wings and bruschetta and did not disappoint ! Will definitely order again !<->1
Pretty yummy happy hour ... that 's always a plus in my bookVery clean and staff are great .. I am gon na have to try it for dinner and update my post .<->1
The marinated chicken Mongolian style was very good ! So stoked they came to our event at work . Fresh ingredients done right .<->1
Good place to eat ! ! ! Amazing staff ! The food is very delicious ! ! ! And the pad see eew is amazing !<->1
One of the best Thai restaurants in Charlotte . I love their Pad Kee Mao . The food is always flavorful and fresh . They can get busy but they always have great customer service .<->1
Brilliant collection of classic arcade games ! !<->1
This is absolutely the worst target store I 've been to . If you call , and someone bothers to answer , they leave you on hold until you hang up . Electronics department is lazy and unhelpful .<->0
Awesome little place . Good prices and good food . The feta fries were delicious . Good service , clean bathrooms . The chairs / sofas are clean and comfortable . Fun date spot to just hang out and chill .<->1
Had the house pretzel as an app , the ab cheese burger and salted caramel pudding . It was all fantastic and I will be coming back .<->1
Ca n't go wrong with this place ! favorites : Pho , fried egg rolls , beef salad , their sweet and sour is unlike any other , if you are yearning for chicken , try # 50 and oh do n't forget Vietnamese coffee<->1
Pretty aloof pharmacy staff . They give conflicting information and seem fairly clueless .<->0
The service is amazing and the food is so good ! ! ! You might have to wait but its still so gooooood<->1
I ordered some asada fries . I usually eat half of Robertos , not these fries . These fries where half the portion . The only good thing was the service .<->2
This is the absolute deceive promotion that how the f Earl of sandwich became the world greatest hot sandwich ? It taste totally ordinary , and even my grandmother can make a better one .<->0
So , we frequent here regularly . Small family run place , great atmosphere , and the pizza is uniquely delicious . It 's more pricey than your average pizza , but worth it . Service has always been excellent .<->1
This is a fun experience to eat in this cute old establishment . We had the pig head to share , unfortunately it was too hard to eat ( it was deeply fried ) . But still I consider it as a interesting experience .<->1
Went in for dinner at this location , then walked out . The people were nice but it smells old , musty and like cockroaches . I would n't have been able to enjoy the food .<->0
This place is simply amazing , We eat there at least once a week , For many years . Definitely a place to go for people who appreciate good food and service .<->1
nothing special about this place . ordered their turkey salad . the turkey was just diced smoked turkey breast loaf . was pretty disappointed .<->2
Great burgers , delicious zucchini ! All fresh ! Reasonable price , casual atmosphere . Takes much longer with a large group .<->1
Awesome friend chicken . Hard to find a parking spot and the line is out the door . Had the Camparo Beans ( pintos with jalapeño and spices ) . So good !<->1
My favorite out of all the Primantis . There is never a long wait . Food is delicious and the servers are friendly .<->1
This place is terribly overrated and overpriced ! The risotto was waaaay undercooked . Do yourself a favor and do n't come here<->0
The world needs more taco guilds . Great ambience amazing food a variety of music and great service ! The street corn is DA BOMB ! ! !<->1
Easily my favorite restaurant in Lakewood . The food is excellent with service to match . The margaritas are exceptional . You will not be disappointed .<->1
Not the best not the worst . Typical mexmeican bar food . Was not impressed with tortila soup . however burrito was decent . margs are decent as well .<->1
First time trying chicken n waffles definitely nothing to write home about . Fried chicken was ok and waffle average at best . They do have good hot sauce .<->2
Love the atmosphere . Eclectic Irish pub decor , comfortable sofa at the table , good food and Guiness and Smithwick ... ahhh .<->1
Great downtown spot & in the Arts district . It is an easy walk to other local downtown spots & the food is always on point .<->1
My new favorite sushi place in Phoenix . Great tasting nigiri , sashimi and unique rolls . Great service and atmosphere .<->1
You seen the picture ... It taste a good as it looks . Will tell friends about this place<->1
Great staff great venue all in all a cool little place great patio . The food was above average with good flavor . Good portion size . Good value for the price .<->1
This is the best Denny 's I have ever been too . It is very clean and the service is excellent . The manager and waitresses are always very warm and friendly . My boyfriend and I go there just for the great service .<->1
Great pizza ! We love grabbing a pie from here as well as the meatballs . Always great food and great customer service !<->1
Nice place to hang out . Too much noise though and it takes time to calm down . Over all its a good place to hang out . Good food and drinks .<->1
Had a great time at The Palm ! Service by Lynn made it extra special ! She had exceptional customer service and every single one of their staff went above and beyond leaving our table impressed !<->1
It would n't kill them to wipe down the tables every now and then . The tables were so disgustingly dirty , it ruined the experience .<->0
This place is great ! We had an awesome server , Brandon . He was really efficient and made great recommendations ! The food was delicious ! !<->1
Inside looks pretty good , and the servers are beautiful . Price is pretty much sports bar average . Great location , downtown Yonge St & Dundas .<->1
Very good pricing . Clean and comfortable restaurant . Friendly service . I loved the Vietnamese sub .<->1
Delicious food , huge portions and after reading all the reviews apparently they got their liquor license back because I was able to order a mango mimosa this morning .<->1
I love this bar ! The service has been great every time i visit , and it 's pretty close to the Chase field , meaning it is my go - to pregame spot before watching the Diamondbacks play !<->1
The music selection right now is killing it . Cute is what we aim for , new found glory and mayday parade to go with my beer and good sushi . Yes please .<->1
Very very subpar . Tried the butterchicken poutine because it sounded interesting but ended up being terrible . There is much much better poutine in the city .<->0
Food is great and service better . First time in today with the wife and grandson . Well worth it . Tucked into a shopping center , imagine that . Highly recommend everyone trying it out .<->1
This location is the best one in Vegas .. great salad bar and I always loved to order my personal pizza .. friendly staff - thanks Espy .. you 're awesome !<->1
Hidden Gen - more low - key then the other Terroni locations with a limited menu , but usually has a great vibe and tasty menu<->1
Best shawerma in the city bar none . Excellent french fries , too . One of their Greek salads with pita bread and shawerma is the best lunch for miles around .<->1
Super cute , delicious fun girls day get awayFroze , special lattes , toasts , wine desserts love the rose gold fixtures . Instagramable walls<->1
Eh . Not really that good . The chicken was n't well trimmed , and the pasta was nothing special . I 'll skip it in the future .<->0
Got all u can eat crab legs and they were fresh , large , not salty , and not over cooked like some local restaurants .<->1
Pretty healthy fare for not much cash .<->2
Went w a large group for a buddy 's B - Day on a Sat . night . Service and food was great . Place is a staple . Yeah , it 's hot food . Great atmosphere .<->1
Yummy . Great food , great wine . If you have n't been to Italy , but want to enjoy a really authenticeal Italian meal , check out Grazie . Authentic Italian food and imported wines .<->1
A trip down memory lane , straight to my aunt helen 's table . Big portions , tasty food , friendly staff . The best !<->1
Fantastic sushi . Fresh fish and great service . Came here for an anniversary and was not disappointed . Staff was courteous . Food came out fast . We will definitely come back later .<->1
First time here , but will add this to our list of favorites ! The customer service was great and everyone super friendly . The shawarma was so savory , and everything from hummus to falafel were delicious . Highly recommend !<->1
Really awesome beef burger . Tasty water :p . odd but true . Yummy dessert . Cosy atmosphere . Friendly staff . Deffinatly recomend it :) .<->1
This locations is probably about two years old and is a nice stop . They have a nice sitting area with TVs if you want to hang out and eat your ordered food . The bathrooms are very clean here .<->1
The place is pretty clean but had to wait over 30 min just for a cup of expresso when nobody else is in front of me ? Ridiculous !<->0
Awesome food ! Awesome staff ! It is a hidden restaurant in the home depot complex . I love this place !<->1
Been here several times for their happy hour . I love the bar area ! Great bartenders , excellent drinks , bone marrow and pig fries ! ! ! What 's not to love ?<->1
Awesome pizza and great people . :-) I 've tried several places with the same concept and love this one by far ... Their pizza and sauces seem to have much more flavor than other places .<->1
Love love love this place ! ! Best pizza ever ! ! The entire crew is always wonderful and they never disappoint with food<->1
Service was excellent ! ! ! Jalapeño chicken tacos were great ... steam burrito was good but could have been bigger in size for our liking ... would go again drink specials were the best reason to visit this location ... go during happy hour ! !<->2
Probably the best deli anywhere in Arizona ! :) HUGE menu & the portions are Big ! Amazing dessert counter in the front ! ! !<->1
My favorite to go place ... the beef sandwich are my favorite followed by the Chicago style hotdogs . I 've had the bbq ribs and those were tender .<->1
A fan because this is only location in Surprise with a drive thru ! Much better than the grocery store " Starbucks " !<->1
Food is excellent ... although the service is a bit awkward ... just a vibe we got .<->1
I love Aubry ! Best server ever !<->1
This place is awesome . Stopped in after Hoover dam . Great salads and fresh sangria and service . Sat inside after fighting with the bees ;) Will definitely stop in again next time I 'm in the area .<->1
Had the pancetta pasta and wife had the pizza . Both were delicious . Staff was very accomodating to our baby in stroller . Will be back for sure .<->1
Hard to tell that the entrance / bottom floor has a bona fide espresso shop ( signage does n't state it ) , but it does . Illy coffee products to boot . Barista made a nice pull and ample seating to people watch Fremont too .<->1
Live right down the street from this place and never knew it was here for a year and a half already ! Food was great and the service even better ! Definitely will return !<->1
One of the best korean bbq in town ! Worth the price for unlimited bbq ! Our server , Simon was great and always there to check us with our needs . Will be coming back here next time .<->1
Atmosphere was nice , and the prices were good . However the more simple rolls were lukewarm . The Vegas rolls were baked and not fried , probably wo n't come back .<->0
Fun place to hang out after work with lots of things to do<->1
Love the sushi here ! I 'm from Vancouver and very picky with my sushi and this restaurant impresses me every time the food is fresh the presentation amazing and the service is great !<->1
Suck , always slow close the lobby too early on the weekends . Cars backed up to the end of parking lot ! ! !<->0
they messed up our order and the food took a hundred years , its almost too big , no ambience<->0
Ate at Carnigie in NY . Had to try this one . We split Ruben . Also egg sandwich and had desert . All were awesome . I so loved the cheesecake .<->1
I was pleasantly surprised ! I went there at 6 am 8/ 31/17 and the young lady and the cook that work the 12 - 8 am were very friendly as well as awesome customer service . Loved the food and very fresh ! ! ! I will be back .<->1
Food excellent , service excellent ! ! ! Our server recommended multiple dishes and all were amazing . Service from the runner and busboy were top notch . Will go back again ! !<->1
Parking needs to improvedThe building is old but in good condition . Cleanliness is not bad , but could be better . ( Vents were dirty ) The food is outstanding , which is driving the 5 star review . Love the food here .<->1
Saw the previews , went to try it out last night . Good was good but the price was kinda high compared to the taste of the food . Overall , it was great ! ! !<->1
A pleasant surprise away from Little Italy . As a Suburbanite will be visiting and take out from here in the future .<->1
Great breakfast crepes and lattes . It is in a good location in the old port . We were very happy to stumble upon this spot .<->1
Brought my wife the other day and tried the brisket sandwich . The staff was helpful and patient with my wife as she usually asks a lot of questions . Abilene is still my favorite .<->1
My # 1 place to go for catering any event . Amazing food and the sauce is to die for ! This restaurants been open for over 25 years in Charlotte , kudos for longevity .<->1
Saw this place come up on SkipTheDishes and decided to check it out in person for lunch . We shared the Mac Attack grilled cheese and I had the Tomato Bisque . Both were great , as was the chocolate milk shake .<->1
Catrina was a very rude bartender . We never asked for specials , ( happy hour or discounts ) she treated us like we were trash . She needs more training behind the bar .<->0
Always love the food . Always love our drinks . And ALWAYS have fabulous service . Been to El C about 10 times . Have only sat at bar to dine . Zero complaints . Love it ! !<->1
? ? ? Lunch ? ? ? d ? ? ? DT ? ? ?<->1
Terrible . Way overpriced , worse than it 's nearby competitors in every measurable way .<->0
Amazing pizza , if only I lived closer so they would deliver to my house . I have no idea why it 's called Chicago style since it 's NY style crust , but either way it 's great pizza ..<->1
I absolutely love the food here . Service is OK . Amazing Peruvian restaurant in Las Vegas . My favorite ceviche !<->1
10 of us dined here a few weeks ago and were delighted with the food and service . Great drinks , great food , and excellent service . Highly recommended .<->1
One of my favorite spots in Charlotte . You ca n't beat the blackened mahi tacos .<->1
Burger flavour was good . However , The gluten free bun costs extra and always falls apart in your hands . It 's impossible to eat without a knife and forkHero needs to solve this problem . Closed for renovation Aug 11 2017<->0
Excellent service . Food is fresh and tasty . Would definitely recommend and come back !<->1
Just your average Chinese food , I like their main dishes but their rice is always tasteless . Definitely always the last option on my list of places to go . Very quick service though .<->2
This is my favorite ! So delicious , every time ! The dinner plates are the best , so much good food at such reasonable prices .<->1
If you have n't had breakfast here yet then I do n't know what you are doing with your life . Everything on the menu is fantastic and the nutella crepe reminds me Thailand street food . Coffee is not bad either .<->1
Cute mom and pops shop . The galub juman is amazing ! ! ! Really great desserts and the samosas are so cheap !<->1
I have been to a lot of Chick - fil - A 's around the country . This one was just as GREAT as all the others . Great chicken and always extremely friendly service . The place was very clean , a big plus .<->1
I was expecting a normal bar burger but to my surprise it was really juicy and very tasty , ... the fries are the bomb ... I will be returning very soon<->1
Ordered garlic nots got pizza dough in a twist . Walked in and the whole staff was sitting at tables . Waste of a good NY pizzeria !<->0
Probably the best bubble tea in Montreal in terms of taste . But service time is extremely slow and line is long . I guess the good taste is worth the wait .<->1
Stopped for breakfast and coffee this morning . The service and staff were very friendly and the breakfast was delicious . Definitely a local find and priced fairly . I will go here again .<->1
A little too far north for me but worth the drive . Food is good , portions are big , owner is courteous .<->1
Bonnes bières et flamkuech . Je recommande<->1
Excellent food , deals , and portions ! Service was awesome as well , very friendly staff . Overall great experience ! Would definitely return !<->1
Did n't try the food because the driver cussed my voicemail / text message out so bad I was too shaken up to eat . Awful delivery experience from EAT 24 .<->0
I ordered the dirty # 2 just chips with truffles , parmesan and chives . For it being a Gordon Ramsay restaurant I was expecting more but was disappointed with the lack of flavor . I 'd rather have Arby 's curly fries .<->2
Excellent food , service , cleanliness , and price . Will definitely tell my friends and return soon . Herbs are super fresh , and Pho 's soup base is clear and tasty . Best Vietnamese place in town for sure !<->1
Great atmosphere and the food was great . It took a bit too long to get our food but it was worth the wait plus the belly dancer kept us entertained .<->1
Hidden gem in China town . My go to Thai place from now on . The prices are fairly low and the food itself is really good .<->1
Amazing ! The bar is very pretty and the bartenders are very nice and helpful . We got a table with a view of the fountain and the Eifel tower . Very romantic and the food was amazing !<->1
Elegant but lively atmosphere - vodkas from all over the world , and a bar made of ice !<->1
One star for the amber beer . Otherwise , the single worst meal in Canadian history - with service to match . Tragic .<->0
Good food and service with good sized servings . Nothing fancy but good reliable diner fare .<->1
I would n't care if they were Harry Truman themed instead of Harry Potter . The important part is that their coffee is fabulous . The Nutella latte is amazing .<->1
Food is amazing here ! The soup is hot and great , the place is super clean and great service . The chicken kabobs are very tasty ! Will def be back for more .<->1
Regardless of the other reviews , this is our local Panera .. always friendly and clean and we will come here often . Breakfast lunch or Dinner they hit the marks . Thanks Panera .<->1
I go here way too often The staff already knows what I like . I love their Ice cream and the matcha latte Quick note , they change their ice cream menu everyday .<->1
Just a bad experience . Like ... Really bad . Zero customer service and it was n't even busy .<->0
Ordering on Foodora regularly . Vietnamese Sandwich are delicious . They use French bread instead of the cheap foamy bread . The bubble tea is much healthier than what you drink normally . They do n't use cheap cofeemate . The cheese cake is amazing .<->1
We have eaten here several times . Good food and value . The pad Thai is legit and the portions are large . If it 's mango season , make sure you get a mango sticky rice !<->1
Ots alright but no senior drink . Ao incant come here no more . I suggest going to a different taco bell leave this one alone<->2
Excellent food , even better service . Our server Ahmed was TOP notch . Truly one of the best servers I have ever had . Try their signature dish !<->1
The food and service was great ! Sadly , the waitress we had said the restaurant will be closing for good on July 20 , 2014 . :(<->1
Even tho I chipped a tooth on bacon ... the food was so tasty ... We went to the location at the M hotel ...<->1
Burgers were good , not great , and staff was rushed which caused them to be rude . I liked the upbeat and young environment and do plan on going back . Those fries were out of this world .<->1
First time here . Super busy , but excellent service . Great Energy . Beautiful inside . Raw bar AMAZING . Definitely Coming Back .<->1
Outstanding Jerk chicken ! The best I 've had in Canada .<->1
I love this place . Super sweet baristas , delicious decaf drinks which is impossible to find , and not too expensive . Never tried the food , but it looked great ! also a great atmosphere to do homework or just chill out .<->1
Such a cute business . It sucks how they 're closed during the Winter season because I definitely have cravings for their Gelato every month . They have very interesting flavors . Captain Crunch and Ferrero Rocher are my favorite !<->1
Closed its doors . It was way too expensive for the portion size . It has since been replace by a NEW DAY CAFE AS OF 9/6 / 16<->0
Was in AZ for Spring Training . Went to a few places that were supposed to be good , but were disappointing . Culinary Dropout did not disappoint . Great food , great drinks , awesome vibe , and amazing service ! !<->1
We went for a Happy Hour as a team to this place . Server was slow and the food was alright . But I heard some good things about the place . Will try it sometime again and check out their live band performing .<->2
Sushi is great , especially the Willis tower , but I am not a big fan of the ramen . It is a little too salty for me .<->1
WONDERFUL Atmosphere ! ! ! Best of all the Pita Jungles . I would definitely come here for a nice dinner ( for a casual price ) . You have to get the Jalapeno Cilantro hummus and try the iced teas . Love this place<->1
Cool atmosphere but the hostess and owner ( look for woman on cowboy hat ) were both unnecessarily snooty to our group of 30 something nice looking crowd . Will not be back .<->0
Little fun fact : this is one of the only chipotle I 've seen where you order your burrito and work left .<->2
This place is the best ! I love this place every time I come here . The flavors are wonderful the presentation is beautiful ! Love it !<->1
The best service we have ever received anywhere . The establishment was impeccable . Staff friendly and attentive . Food was excellent .<->1
Great food and the service is always GREAT , however it is a bit pricey . Maybe not the best place for kids<->1
Pretty good ! Got the plate for two and it was wayyy more food than we could eat . Food is good and comes out pretty quick . Not a bad place to go to . Friendly service .<->1
A very cool , seedy dive bar where you can still smoke and get in some choice people watching !<->2
I really love the atmosphere of this place . It 's very laid back and warm . Their beer selection is great although their wine selection is lacking . I recommend this place to all my friends .<->1
Love the Big Rig . Servers are very friendly ... and the meatballs are delicious !<->1
My daughter and I liked it . Ordered string beans and chow fun . They were both good . Nothing bad to say . Came on a Saturday at noon . Not busy . Parking was good . Price was ok . I had leftovers .<->1
Great food in charlotte . The service could be a bit better , but overall , it 's a spot that everyone should check out .<->1
The food is amazing and the service is amazing . AMAZING X2 Looks like I will coming back here again and again . I think JJanga is going to be my new favorite sushi spot .<->1
First time to the restaurant and the food was good . The fresh spring rolls and peanut sauce were great , and the Tom Ka soup with chicken as well . The young waitress was friendly .<->1
Convenient , fast , super yummy ! ! Huge sandwiches and good prices . If you have n't been to pops ... GO !<->1
I love Olive Garden and their food .<->1
Love the staff & the people here ! Neighbourhoods need to support each other ... yay ! Cabbagetown !<->1
Love the sweet pork . Tostada , Salad , or burrito , they are all great . The house dressing with the salad / tostada is always a winner . Also , the best rewards program around . I love the app !<->1
Great experience , beautiful rooms , great service and we look forward to visiting another Trump Hotel in the future .<->1
Awesome staff , very accommodating . Food is just mediocre and menu is very very limited . Seemed overpriced for what it is .<->2
I 've quit shopping here . Tired of the piss poor customer service , bad quality control and stock , and the nightmarish parking . Might as well save money and shop at Walmart . Same type of people shop at both .<->0
Big great food @ reasonable prices ! I say share ! I had a turkey sandwich and pizza roles both were good but more than enough food for 2 , we had leftovers !<->1
This is the best Indian food I 've ever had . A supplier took us out for lunch , and I 'm already looking forward to the next time . Highly recommend !<->1
Second time here ! Portions are enough for two .. love it . Wait staff was outstanding .. love Nicole . Patio in March awesome<->1
The ' Red Velvet Elvis ' is like crack - coconut too - I like the little ones .<->1
Much better than I expected ! It 's like the Jetsons moved to Sweden ! Updated and friendly . Spa was just ok . But restaurant is the bomb !<->1
The quality of the food was fabulous . The potions gave us enough food for a whole other meal . The service and kindness of the owner was the icing on the cake . Thank you Jameel .<->1
Had a very nice time . Food was terrific . I sat on the belcony ... great idea .. great location ... our server Erin was allot of fun and was very attentive . Defiantly would come again ! ! !<->1
This was one my go to places while I visited Las Vegas . The best nachos I 've had . The environment was a bit noisy , waitress was great , service was quick , and was inexpensive .<->1
Really delicious and fair price . Only have gotten beef bulgogi a few times but it 's great . Not the healthiest but tastes great . Try to go earlier to avoid the long lines .<->1
If you come here thinking it 's going to be a normal restaurant . Go elsewhere . They insult you and it 's funny . Food was good too . Do n't come here if you do n't have a sense of humor .<->1
This place is amazingly down to earth with all their dishes . I 've come here with my family on several occasions already and the food and service was excellent each time . You really ca n't go wrong with this place .<->1
I eat here weekly . Mitzie and her staff are nice and and the food is always on point .<->1
59 minutes left til closing an no glaze donuts ? ? ? Is this laziness or mismanagement at this location ? ?<->0
Went here with friends and was extremely impressed with the quality and flavors of the food . Great for sharing entrees and appetizers . Full bar at your disposal is a plus . Friendly staff . Go here ! Trust the fat kid .<->1
Our biggest purveyor of a wide variety of liquor ! Yes , I m a fan .<->1
I 'm a fan . Cozy spot , good smells from the kitchen and the pizza is great . Toothsome and tasty . None of that high brow so popular today just good food for watching a game or a movie .<->1
Pretty good build - your - own tacos with amazing Caribbean drinks . Try their slaw with pulled pork on corn tortillas . Also the guacamole rocks !<->1
Had the classic Cubano and it was perfect ! Also the tostones were great and I especially recommend choosing the homemade garlic sauce on the side .<->1
Excellent beer selection and a surprisingly sophisticated menu highlight a fun new spot in Monona . I recommend the War Pig and the carrot cake !<->1
Serving cold food on styrofoam plates = class . The service was horrible , with the waitress saying they had ' ground beef ' and came out with steak , saying ' That s what we have ' . Also , got food poisoning . Stat away !<->0
Amazing skillets , awesome staff . It was a pretty busy Sunday but we got sat in five minutes and the food came out fast . Will definitely come back .<->1
Super cute neighborhood mom - n - pop place with fantastic kitschy Star Wars decor . Lots of syrups , lots of space , free Wi - Fi . Retro video game machine with Ms . Pac Man and what not .<->1
the best shawarma and flavored rice I had in a long time . All the sauces taste great . Friendly owner / chef ! A must go !<->1
Food quality : average . Poor serviceIf you want to eat good Indian food , this is not a right place .<->0
Best burger I had , anywhere .<->1
Amazing ! Always a long wait but worth every second . So much food you can share . We love breakfast and lunch . The drinks at the bar are a work of art !<->1
Klasse Essen jedem zu empfehlen ! Netter Service , leicht gehobene Preise , die sich durchaus rechtfertigen . Immer wieder gerne !<->1
Love this place ! Food is great and the staff is always very nice . Food take a little bit to come out but other than that , sushi is really good !<->1
good deals , nice mom and pop place . The flavors are pretty consistent here . Yay for check in deals !<->1
The food is always good . But again another failure on the pre - order process . I placed my order 45 min early , and it still was n't started when I arrived at the scheduled time .<->0
We were seated outside . Great view . Service ok . Quality of food ok . Even though my steak sat on the counter for a while before it made it to my table . Drink menu very good , and pricy . Would I go back ? Maybe .<->2
Nice enough staff , but the lunch menu is unimpressive . Probably a better dinner place , when the club crowd is in effect . Bar looked like it had a decent selection , though .<->2
1st time here based on the reviews . Friendly atmosphere and the food was fresh and very tasty . Highly recommend .<->1
Great pizza . Cheese is from Wisconsin they tell me . Good stuff !<->1
Delicious and authentic Indian food in a welcoming atmosphere . The lunch buffet is delicious , but the dinner entrees are just as affordable and super tasty .<->1
Surprisingly decent food - not your typical pub food . The service is chill but attentive . The burger , calamari ( with a delicious slaw ) , wings , and apps were all really good .<->1
I went to check it out and the food was excellent . Restaurant quality with hole in the wall prices .<->1
Almost gave it a four , due to cost , but it 's actually a great experience ! ! ! Not just the taste , but the ambiance ! Try their daily lasagna !<->1
It 's Pete 's . no complaints , it 's food porn no one admits to liking it but its always busy .<->2
Great place ! Had a Birthday reservation there and they were completely helpful , the staff . The food was really good . Jamaican food with Caribbean vibes . They were busy , but that did n't delay the food orders . Would definitely recommend .<->1
Not quite sure where all the five star reviewers ate ! ! ! You could get better food in a hospital cafeteria ! If you build it , they will come ... But likely only once !<->0
This is your all American diner but just done a lot better . Excellent customer service , had the spinach feta sundried tomato omelette ... Pancakes amazing . Also great crepes . Highly recommended . Prepare for a wait though .<->1
Not bad . No veggie egg rolls though . Most of the non - seafood dishes have a slight fishy taste because the grill / wok / whatever is used to cook virtually everything .<->1
Staff are all very friendly , enthusiastic and helpful ! And pizza was even better than I imagined ! So quick and very generous with the toppings .<->1
Interesting and tasty selections , new rolls specific to their location that I have n't seen anywhere else . Glad I read the reviews , it 's a great place to eat .<->1
I love this place . The margaritas are fabulous - all kinds of flavors . This is a great hangout place and the service is always good .<->1
Great selection . Everything was fresh . They accommodated our large group ( about 25 people ) pretty well .<->1
great food ! hot pot was delicious and service was great . very diverse menu in terms of covering main asian dishes . will definitely return . and it 's open late !<->1
This place is our go to for eating at home . Their orange chicken and Kung pao chicken are both amazing ! !<->1
I bought the original bun and cream puffs with a discount of 20 % off . The buns are very soft and moist . Cream texture was really good , not overly sweet . I would definitely return to try the strawberry buns .<->1
What a great place . All the reviews are accurate . The place is spotless . The service and food were amazing . Highly recommend .<->1
This place is fast with friendly staff . The decor is new . Highly recommend !<->1
Came here about 4 times and they are great with groups as well ! Everything is always super fresh , and the staff are super accommodating and nice . A little bit on the pricier side , but would definitely recommend .<->1
Thought the food was really good ! Got a to go order and have not dined in . A little unfortunate that there is no alcohol served but will continue to go for dinner and take out !<->1
I enjoyed the steak and sides very much . Get the garlic and cilantro sauce . Its absolutely to die for<->1
Always clean , quick and consistent . Great value fast food that is restaurant quality .<->1
Super cute place . Love Harry Potter theme . It 's wonderful . Coffee was good , but I had higher expectations with it . Hopefully it gets better . I would want to hang out here more often than not still .<->1
This place is legit . Had the Tonton noodle ramen , with fried chicken , gyoza and an ice cold Asahi draft . Everything was authentic . Best Ramen since I left Japan .<->1
This place is delicious ! So many flavors and the employees are so friendly ! A lady gave me a free cookie for trying them for the first time !<->1
Love this place . I ordered F Bomb sandwich and so did my husband . It was awesome . Got a side of hummus and pita . That too was great . Look forward to warmer weather so we can eat outside at their restaurant .<->1
Excellent food and drinks and excellent service . We dined there tonight . It is " old school " and that 's what makes it so special . Love Tee Pee !<->1
A must - go for anyone living or visiting Charlotte , Nc ! Get the wings and blueberry beer . This is always a go to spot for meeting up with friends and playing outdoor games .<->1
I had brunch here last week . The food was delicious . I love they give you a beer , or mimosa with a $ 10 brunch item .<->1
Perfect quick bite before a movie . We got a buffalo chicken sandwich . Yum ! ! ! Crunchy and huge ! also got a Cobb salad . It was n't amaIng but was what was expected . :)<->1
It 's above average ice cream , by we were third in line and it took 30 mins ... those 10 back probably took an hour . We were done eating and they barely moved . That kind of service is 2 star max .<->0
Great venue , fun atmosphere and entertainment . The food potions however are horribly tiny and mediocre at best . Our party of 4 was very disappointed . Not recommended unless you go for cocktails and light appetizers .<->0
Gotham bagels are simply the best in Madison and closest thing to NYC bagels . They are hand - rolled and topped with artisanal cream cheese that ranges from plain to even Gochugang flavored . The cheese is really tangy and fresh . Highly recommend !<->1
Sitting here for 20 minutes and had to ask someone to get us drinks - small child at our table - not very service oriented<->0
The environment was very friendly , and the " Love Hate Thing " crepe was to die for . I 'm still thinking about it a day later !<->1
Always good pizza , fast delivery , outstanding quality compared to all others that deliver . Thanks for great service .<->1
I have eaten here 3 or 4 times for lunch since opening and have typically ordered either the Spicy Seafood Raman Noodle soup or the Udon Tempura soup , and both are wonderful . Good , generous portions and friendly service .<->1
Love their burgers ! This is easily one of my top 5 places to get a burger . Nice place , good service , good prices .<->1
Food is in the mediocre to good range , nothing crazy special . They have a nice variety . It gets the 4 star bump for dessert . You know what is badder than a bangle tiger ? The peanut butter tiger cookie from here !<->1
Sauce is amazing , prepared perfect and was still that way when delivered ! Crust is crispy yet soft . Not as greasy as most places around . YUM ! ! ! So glad we found this place !<->1
well worth a visit . bought a few things and had some luch . A great break from trawling Freemont . Do n't tell anyone though .<->1
This location has n't served chocolate ice cream for at least two years now . We live a block away from this one , but started driving up to the one on Aliante .<->0
We spend new year eve last year and the ambience was great for the countdown and the food as well .<->1
The pepper sauce is amazing . I always like to try hot sauces and Williams crafted a pepper sauce . Love it . And everything else on the menu .<->1
My favorite coffee right now ! Great taste and if you add some of the creamer , even better ! I 'm hooked !<->1
Pathetic and over priced for what we were given ... Not impressed with this establishment ... I believe over the years the quality has deteriorated from sharps ... next time ur better off eating bread and that 's it<->0
Best pulled pork I have EVER eaten . Food was great , super fast and very reasonable for BBQ . Next time I go back I 'm getting all pulled pork .<->1
I love this place but the staff at night are super rude . They miss things on your order have an attitude and take forever ! ! !<->0
5stars Great food . Pretty sure they win best jerk chicken at jerk fest every time they enter . The food here is best Love it .<->1
Brought some friends from out of town here for drinks and dinner and it was fantastic ! Great service and all the games were on .<->1
Exceptional food and service .. everything we ordered was great . I would definitely recommend the patatas bravas , the paella , sangria and the tres leches cake . Money well spent !<->1
The food is certainly overpriced , but the food is decent and the ingredients are fresh . I would recommend the crepes or the make - your - own pasta station .<->2
Excellent evening . Fabulous environment - moorish nosh and fabulous martinis . We will be back .<->1
This place is legit . The pumpkin and banana flavors are really good . Best to go during non peak hours or days of the week .<->1
Walked in 1 minute before closing on a Friday night and I still got excellent service<->1
I 've always loved Indian food and this is definitely one of the best on campus ! You gon na love the tasty curry and the naan ! ! !<->1
This place should know that on a concert night that they will be busy . Literally waited 40 minutes for a drink . Absolutely ridiculous . Get some more workers that actually care about their clients .<->0
Great Pakistani food . Good price as compare to portion of food . I would give them 5stars if they have good sitting arrangement and cleanness .<->1
Too many flavours for it to be home made . In fact I tried 4 different flavours and all of them tasted artificial . Definitely will not be back<->0
If you 're not crazy about matcha get the half vanilla and half matcha soft serve . I made the mistake of getting matcha ice cream with a matcha drink . I like matcha but it was a bit too much .<->1
Fantastic food ... not the greatest atmosphere to eat in but ... if you appreciate quality food and salsas it 's really good<->1
Come here every time when I 'm in town . Best breakfast in town . Must try , you wo n't regret it .<->1
Best icecream I have had in my life . The cardamom flavor was great . Line up was a bit but worth every minute . You have to try this place .<->1
Best Mexican restaurant in vegas ! They also have one of the best happy hours in town . You have to get the guacamole - I like it spicy . Their chips and salsa are delicious and I love the margaritas !<->1
Kickass joint . Had some white sausage and some Schmukers . I was entirely satisfied with my service . The owner even came out and saw to my satisfaction . Das gashous is a lovely place<->1
Solid sandwiches any time of day . Super friendly but can get very busy at lunchtime . Order ahead .<->1
Everytime I go to this location everything is hot and delicious and their daily ice cream specials are a great perk ! Employees are nice fast and accurate !<->1
Intelligentsia beans . Single - cup brewing : Clover or pourover , crafted with care , precision . Husband - and - wife owners know their stuff . Hip Strip District locale , great coffee find . Window seat : rockin ' view .<->1
LOVE ; the hot wings ! LIKE ; the delicious pizza ! Always ready fast ! DISLIKE ; nothing , although some may not like that it 's in a gas station . Idc .<->1
Excellent breakfast items , the potatoes are seasoned like crack . The portions are big so it 's probably worth sharing . We had a Groupon so the value was great ! ! ! The coffee was extreme tasty . Excellent service !<->1
Great food ! Piri piri sauce is amazing . Service is not the most friendly but good value for price<->1
Not a fan . Quaker steak wings are better . To each their own . Never been impressed with the wings . Watching a game with the guys is good time with some drinks but the food quality is always subpar at best .<->0
I ve been here 3 times now and every one was a personal greeting and great experience ( food , price , and atmosphere ) . There s a lot of people that come during lunch , but it does n't feel rushed .<->1
Best burgers I have tasted in a while ... The onion rings were good ... The food is pricey but well worth it ... Good customer service<->1
Worst service ever but the still are busy . Clearly they are understaffed and management is lacking . Nice kids work here not their fault . The building has been remodeled and has a nice look and feel . BUT the service sucks .<->0
Had this for a second time and enjoyed it as much as my first . If you 're looking for sushi or may , go to wynn or bellagioGood : Seafood qualityHuge assortment of food . Dessert selection . DecorService ! Bad :P ricingSushiOk : MeatAsian food<->1
Ehhh ... whatever . Overpriced even for Hooters if you can believe it . Also serves cold beer in warm mugs . Makr sense to you ? Me neither<->2
Excellent food and service . Had the Ribeye end cap and it was delish !<->1
The hands - down best pizza in the world . Chef and owner Chris Bianco was recently given the James Beard award for Best Chef Southwest .<->1
Really like their kabobs . My family go their frequently and I have taken several friends there and they all love the food . So sad that they have closed<->1
Great food , great customer service , very friendly Absolutely healthy food . They have gelato bar . All kabobs are so delicious I 'm so impressed . We will definitely go back again<->1
Great service , great food ! Everything I 've tried here is really good . My boyfriend and I especially love the garlic noodles ! Never disappoints !<->1
Very good spot . The wings are the best you can find in Medina for sure ! Have n't tried the burgers yet , because the wings are too good to pass up on<->1
Food is edible . Some dishes are a miss , others a hit . The problem with this place is with the management . Service is slow and awkward , and management need to treat their female colleagues respectively . Would not eat here again .<->0
The eggplant appetizer was delicious as was the rest of our food . A + rigatoni . Cooked to perfection . The service was great and the food is superb . Going to recommend this restaurant to everyone at work !<->1
Very impressive authentic sushi in Las Vegas . High quality very nice serviceGood atmosphere Nothing to complain<->1
I think it 's terrible to go get a hamburger and a small fry it 's going to cost you almost $ 7.50 so I had to take off the Frey 550 for a hamburger where is McDonald 's<->0

My family loves this place . We 've been here so many times that the waitresses call us by our names now . Yakitori is authentic , but the kid 's favorite is the age mochi ( fried rice cakes ) . Better to make reservations on weekends .<->1
I wish there was one of these restaurants at home ! Excellent food and service . Our waitress recommended the Yucatan Pork and the Chicken Publano Enchiladas . We had them both and loved them !<->1
I have been here several times , food flavor is very consistent . What sets this place apart from other restaurants is the staff , very friendly and accommodating . The food its self is 7/10 , non greasy but lacks the wow factor .<->1
First time there . Friendly employees , clean place , great food and portions . Only thing I did n't like , was the Texas toast . Was dry , no butter or garlic salt on it . Looked like plain old loaf bread . Will be back again .<->1
Omg this McDonald 's is so rude , they do n't smile and they look like they hate everyone . They always get my order wrong and I 've been there only 3 times . Do n't go here bad customer service .<->0
Prices are great , but the quality is n't the best . you have to pick threw on a few items to find something fresh<->2
Veggie / vegan options had astonishingly good flavor . The jicama salad was perfectly spicy and the vegetarian / cauliflower tacos did not disappoint . The cauliflower was n't overcooked and well retained all the spices of the dish .<->1
Nothing special or fancy , but it has simple food for a simple price . Gina is really nice .<->1
Burger has a great char , rings are fantastic , but you must add your own salt ( critical )<->1
My favourite brunch place in Toronto ! Beautiful Decor , friendly stuff and great food ! Whole atmosphere is absolutely gorgeous and their food and deserts are great !<->1
Love the froyo here ! Nice and clean on the inside , can sit outside if you want to . Friendly staff ! I prefer coming to Yogurt Land instead of U Swirl . Although U Swirl had more selections ...<->1
Great find on our way into town with our dog . Back patio with fans . Food was AWESOME . Had arepa 's with fried plantains .<->1
For a quick bite that is tasty and not a typical fast food chain try the Red Pepper . The sandwiches are great and they have a variety of tasty homemade soups .<->1
Good ol Chuck E . Cheese not much has changed since I was a kid . My daughter & her cousin had fun<->1
This is my favorite Thai place in the city . All of their curries are wonderful and can be vegan . And I 'm pretty sure this is a woman owned business .<->1
Loved watching the Pats game there . Bartenders were great and the BBQ chicken salad is my favorite !<->1
Always great service ! Thin crust pizza is great as well . Try a side salad and add some bruschetta on top ! Ca n't beat it . The happy hour is a good deal too !<->1
Best Pizza place in my area . We love this place ! ! Their number has changed 702.808.9422 So be sure to call this number to place an order !<->1
Best pizza I have ever had in Toronto . Better than Pizzeria libretto by far . A whole bunch of red and white pizzas . Fun atmosphere and very friendly staff .<->1
Always a nice experience ! I come here all the time with my family and the staff always remembers us . They also did an amazing job catering my graduation party which was a hit because of them .<->1
Decent place ! Great flavors like ube and cheese ice cream . Variety may be lacking a bit . Employees are very friendly and prices are reasonable . I wish they had more drink options and more seats . Its a very tight fit in there .<->1
This place is more for tourists . It 's decor is inviting & it 's a great place to hang out - the menu is nothing extraordinary - American / Mexican - Margaritas are good , food is nothing special , pricey<->2
Another good experience when looking on yelp for food places . Our waiter was nice . Food came out fast ! Good food good homie feeling . Thanks yelpers !<->1
Terrible . Ca n't believe how many people were in there for the quality of food . Had the eggs , sausage , pancake and potato plate . None of it was good . Worst pancakes I 've ever had .<->0
I love the food , the service & the atmosphere ! Sal is the best ! I 'll be there for date nite with the wife Saturday ! Mike<->1
Beef stew was delicious , loved the rich beefy broth and tender pieces of beef and tendon ! Egg rolls were nicely fried with a light wrap and filled with a generous amount of vegetables and pork . Definitely returning !<->1
Food excellent ; service h o r r I b l e ! The Chinese biryani , unusual and tasty . Don ' t know to make a bacardi & coke<->0
El lugar es fantástico la atención del personal muy buena ! ! ! Son muy amables y la comida deliciosa se los recomiendo ^ ^<->1
Wonderful place to take the kids on a Saturday morning . The staff was very friendly and helpful , and the prices were very reasonable .<->1
Good for the price . Not classy by any stretch of a delusional imagination . But chill place to kick back with descent prices . Go as you like and drink / eat ... Then move on to next party place .<->1
Great spot for a large gathering . The place has great ambience being outside while enjoying good food and drinks .<->1
Good food , but the line ... uhh ... the line . Waited long to get seats :)<->1
Just went backIt 's still amazingI loved their spicy kafta rollSo healthy , different , cheap , quick , awesome ... I 'm a big fan . I wish they had one of these in Phx :(<->1
I love this place , I specially love the soup station the steamed fish and a variety of steam veggies . Why did it closed , someone told me renovation .<->1
Crap . Food is meh , pricy and bla service . No ambiance , waiters look always stressed out . Do n't eat here .<->0
Owner is the real deal - love that guy and his passion shows in the great food . Turkey sandwich , pizza and cold salad with their special dressing is world class just like their management<->1
This place was excellent ! Girls and I had Paninis , they were excellent and the bill was barely over $ 21 . Will definitely make it back here when in own !<->1
Its my go - to place for thai food ! Love all the variety of fried rice . Food is served hot and fresh . Highly recommend it !<->1
Not only was my butter garlic ribeye yummy , but our waiter Gavin Z . Was amazing ! ! He was kind , courteous , timely , professional , and provided true white glove kind of service .<->1
Had the opportunity to dine in on Friday Cinco de Mayo . 2 Hispanic waiters were very rude and unprofessional . The food was good but very unfriendly staff members . Will not go back .<->0
This is a great place for Chinese . Fresh and friendly . I love the Cantonese chow mien as well as the chicken balls . Interior design is old , but the food and service make up for it .<->1
Now the excellent coffee choice in Oakland . Friendly staff , attention to detail , delicious . I like the use of local whole chocolate milk for the mocha . Your to - go cup gets a classy stamp when you order . Will be returning .<->1
Great atmosphere , fancy and french . The service was great and the food was delicious , great presentation . A little on the pricy side , but you get what you pay for .<->1
Recently discovered this little gift and have been a regular ever since ! Fantastic , fresh , delish . Do n't wait , run there now !<->1
Very good and fresh food . Their skillet hash plates are fantastic . They are reasonably priced and have good portion sizes .<->1
Large restaurant Downtown , the Original Fish Market does have some fabulous offerings and is usually easy to score a table .<->1
Excellent Vietnamese fusion dishes for a great price !<->1
I 'll affirm other reviews . Food was delicious , reasonably priced , and the service was friendly . We will go back for sure . The Bistec Mexicano was wicked good .<->1
This is a great breakfast spot . Terrific omelettes and scrambles with unique flavor combinations and excellent meats , bacon , sausages etc ... vegetarian options as well , of course . The biscuits are excellent , and the Portuguese donuts are simply sublime .<->1
NAAAAAAAASTY ! ! ! BURGERS tasted like paper ! We were so disappointed ! could honestly say we will NEVER eat there ever again .<->0
This place has the best dounts and that 's the only reason I go there , because the customer service is n't that great !<->2
Nothing special . The prices are very high . In Italy the same things i took i would have payed 5  not 15 $ as i did , and it would taste better :)<->2
Food , drinks and service are great . Finally a place that stays open past 10 pm in Waxhaw .<->1
We had a great lunch here . It 's family owned and they were extremely friendly and made a great recommendation . The sweet Italian and grilled cheese were both delicious .<->1
I love the morning crowd . Super quick but yet they take their time . I love the customer service , they definitely help my morning !<->1
Great food . I 've never tasted such a good Eggs Benedict . I did the sandi beach one . And service was quick . And lots of Windows . Nice and bright !<->1
The food here is really bad . It 's made by Arabic people there cooking Persian food . it 's very tasteless the rice is horrible do n't come here<->0
Terrible service ! Never had to wait for a single drink the time I waited at this place .. Plus , the staff is extremely unfriendy .. Never going back !<->0
Love their subs so much more than subway . an original large for $ 3 is such a steal too<->1
Everything is quick here , very Hong Kong style and be prepared to sit with strangers . Do n't expect " service " but the wonton noodle soup is definitely one of the best in GTA .<->1
This place is amazing . The quality and flavors of the food were so impressive for the price . Booked a reservation for a graduation dinner on the way out of our first visit !<->1
Came in on Friday after work . Good beer selections . Bartenders were attentive and knowledgeable . Had pineapple beer and a few others . Nice front patio and back / side patio . Great place for dogs . Had apps here before and they were great .<->1
Great breakfast burritos and various fishes . Enjoy a Mimosa or a Bloody with your eggs ...<->1
Fun place . Pretty good beer selection , service is okay . Burgers are pretty good but tend to be undercooked ( at least last couple times we went ) . They are quick to fix it though so still would recommend !<->1
They really need to bring back the spinach and artichoke dip ! ! Lost a star from me because they recently took it off the menu .<->1
I was disappointed that I could n't get a tasting on Saturday , but they were very nice and they have a great reputation , so hopefully in the near future I can experience the joy that all thier current customers experience<->1
Food is good . Decor is nice . The buffet is alright . Serve with fresh naan . I just hope they add more selection to the buffet<->1
Always a metro employees favorite . Awesome service . Prices are reasonable . HUMUS ROCKS .<->1
Very yummy , fresh made food . The Fried Chicken and Catfish are cooked to order . The sides are ample and flavorful . Service is casual , so sit back and relax . Enjoy the experience .<->2
We love the burgers and the wait staff is always very pleasant . My only complaint is that the owners need to clean it up a bit .<->1
Great tasty burgers . But to mention their poutine ! The Philly steak poutine is fulfilling and will make you confer back .<->1
Curried Chicken salad or sandwich is good . Bar - B - Q chicken wrap is also a winner .<->1
Would be a lot better if they had miller lite on draft . Had the fra diablo which was supposed to be spicy but it was something that I would serve to a hospital patient recovering from stomach surgery .<->0
Large parking lot . We were immediately greeted by the hostess . Food was delicious ! Wings were banging and the chicken and bacon ranch wraps were good !<->1
Very delicious ramen . I ordered Mame Miso with Chasu . The pork melted in my mouth like butter and the broth was very tasty . Better than a lot of ramen places in California . Definitely worth visiting if you 're in Vegas !<->1
Good service ! Great location ! Good food ! Will definitely go back to this place . It seems like a upscale Lebanese restaurant , but pricing is quite moderate .<->1
I have never had anything bad here . Food is fresh and tasty . Staff is wonderful and the decor is like sitting inside a painting . cash or check only is a down side<->1
Love this place a awesome please tried . Friendly staff food is great my number one place for Vietnamese food .. try try try ! ! ! So delicious<->1
this place reminds of of a nicer Olive Garden . Food is ok , expansive menu . Busy at lunch and dinner probably more to do with its location close to arenas and hotels .<->2
This is my favorite boba drink place in town . It comes with the variety of choices . It also have one of the best popcorn chicken in town .<->1
The vegetable goat cheese empanadas are easily the best thing I have eaten since I moved to Madison . The restaurant itself is very loud in peak times . People need to use their inside voices , but that s not the restaurants fault<->1
Great Filet and Baked patato . Service is always good .<->1
Only been in Vegas a few months and LOVE this place ! Prices are fantastic in most stores and my daughter loves the big merry go round in the court . Must shop here wether you 're a tourist or local !<->1
Great food , great views and our waiter Paul gave us the best service we had on our entire trip . We had to wait about an hour for patio seating , but it was well worth it .<->1
So very good ! I loved my omelet and they even offer french vanilla creamer . Service was top notch too !<->1
Best brown rice ever ! I love veggie house ! Always crave it ! Eaten here 3 times in the month of may . I recommend the Walnut Shrimp and Lotus Root Cake !<->1
Great food ! Chef Tony came personally to ensure we were happy with the food and service .<->1
? ? ?<->1
Service was friendly and attentive . Restaurant was clean . Forgettable Asian American food though . Steak was dried out like jerky . Chicken was soggy . Egg rolls and noodles were good . Veggies were also fresh and crisp . Good spot for vegetarians .<->2
Really good . Needed a little more help from the order takers for first time . Loved the environment .<->1
Wow ! Wow ! Wow ! So Amazing ! Best Fried Chicken Ever ! Best Service Ever ! We love the food and the staff are always so friendly , respectful and helpful ! A + + + ! ! ! Yum !<->1
The staff is friendly and helpful . They cheerfully remade my BLT after I forgot to mention that I did not want any mayo . The BLT had lots of bacon .<->1
Great vegan food , good service . I liked the soup du jour . For true vegans , this is a real find , so I give it 5 stars .<->1
We go to Olives every time we 're in Vegas . Their beef carpaccio is amazing & try the Tiffany Martini . We enjoy sitting at the bar , never wait for a table . Our favorite bartenders are Chris , Ernie , Zach and Raul .<->1
Their coconut ' pancake ' was MIND BLOWING . My mom and I devoured it . Everything else was super tasty too . Good prices , quick service and outstanding , authentic Southern Indian cuisine . Will go again when I 'm on this side of town .<->1
This is my go to family Italian place . Scratch made NYC style made with love . Not too spendy , good food at an honest price .<->1
Unpretentious little hippie cafe with friendly service . Seems to be packed all the time<->2
The house wine was terrible . The garlic bread felt like it was dusty . The chicken Parmigiana was somewhere under the sauce .<->0
Breakfast brunch on weekend puri with halwa meat dishes and it 's a buffet . Food was good . typical of any indian restaurtant . service a bit slow . would try again for the brunch .<->2
Both me and my wife had dinner there and the cocktails were very well prepared . .. Scott y ramona will be back . The tequila camarone cocktail was delicious ... gracias<->1
No complaints , cozy chairs to wait for by the shade and several people cleaning it at the same time helped me leave faster . Really clean inside and out ! Definitely coming back<->1
Great food at a very reasonable price . The fry bread is very light and delicious - definitely try this when visiting . The staff was really friendly and everything we had was excellent .<->1
Great neighbourhood sushi restaurant . The sushi was fresh , service was fast and friendly , and the prices are reasonable . Will come by again !<->1
Nothing better than a bagel on the way to Mt . Charleston for a day of hiking ! The Dutch Apple bagel is outstanding . Wish I could have one every day .<->1
Great service and food . Max fixed me carpaccio that was not on the menu . Enjoyed the personal attention . Mike behind the bar was super nice . Thank you . Will be back .<->1
Amazing donuts , fast and friendly service . Has a convenient 24 hour drive thru and the store is clean !<->1
The food here was delicious Service was good One of the best Ethiopian restaurant . Glad I visited while in Phoenix<->1
Great little place . Great food and you make the choices of pasta type and sauce . Only like 8 tables . Easy location in Summerlin . Right on Lake Mead just past Buffalo<->1
Cashier was very nice . The guy at pickup counter was a complete a * * hole ! Horrible attitude and demeanor . I 'll pass this review to other students and residents of DT Tempe . Should 've gone to Taco Bell !<->0
My husband and I are regulars at Sumo since we discovered this little gem a little over a year ago . The sushi is fantastic and the service is always amazing . Happy hour selection and prices are great !<->1
Received an arrangement for my anniversary today . Fantastic ! ! ! Cantaloupe , honeydew , grapes , and pineapple are PERFECT ! ! !<->1
The price is okay and the pizza is quite good for a In - casino - to - go pizza place . Ca n't complain<->1
Simply put . Best Cuban food in the east valley at a great price . Feels like I 'm at home and my abui is cooking in the kitchen .<->1
Food is great , awesome beer selection , owner tends to give a bit of attitude and service is just slooooowww<->1
It was OK . There are better Indian restaurants in town . Location was Off . Service was off . We have ordered something , they served something else . See I did not know about Health department report . I would not suggest / recommend this to anyone .<->0
All - around excellent experience . Tender filet , all food served at perfect temperatures , great prompt service even on a busy night . These folks seem to have their act well together .<->1
No good ordered a meal no chips in my to go order nothing like the flagstaff store very disappointed thumbs down<->0
Kalbi , overcooked , charred and mostly bones . Had many recommendations by others to eat here however not impressed and will not be back .<->0
Was not super impressed with the California Bowl ( shrimp ) . Was mostly white rice and beans . Shrimp were tasty . Just OK and for $ 9 it 's way overpriced . Go to Chipotle instead for better ingredients and cheaper prices .<->2
Best Vietnamese food I 've had , and I 've been to some very good Vietnamese places . Very fresh and delicious .<->1
In no way did they make me feel awkward about sampling all the flavors !<->1
Decent Ambience . Food was pretty okish . Its loud because of tables placed very close to each other . Small flies spotted .<->2
New hot spot for boba tea ! Their avocado boba is awsome ! My wife loves their brew milk tea .<->1
I used to love sidelines but the picture speaks for itself . Asked for a MEDIUM WELL burger and get this and even if you asked for a rare burger it should be more cooked . This was seared at best .<->0
The tuna is always fresh veggies always fresh service is awsome and i m picky so i have to have top notch and this place is it . Freshhhhhhh food loce it here<->1
Best meat pies I 've ever had ! Great location and friendly staff , ca n't wait to come back .<->1
The patio was quite . Service was good and the food was also delicious . Nice selection of scotch , but be prepared to spend some money . It ai n't cheap , but then again , scotching is n't a cheap hobby .<->1
Food is decent , casual chill place . Mostly came for the beer and the selection did not disappoint .<->1
The service is excellent ; the service is fast ; the food is really good . Better than Pho Kim Long by a lot . The portions are generous . The price is right . Will definitely come back .<->1
High quality oysters but also outstanding food from chef Jim . Staff service was very attentive to dietary requests . Good wine and draft selection . Could n't ask for much more .<->1
Issmi is truly North York 's hidden gem . If I ca n't have Issmi , I wo n't have Japanese cuisine anywhere else . Seriously . The food is always fresh and the ingredients are always of high quality .<->1
Great pizza , fast delivery . I personally prefer my thin crust crispier , but I ca n't knock them for that .<->1
I really enjoy this spot ! Great staff and the food is pure comfort . The price is right too . I recommend the strawberry juice , and the corn soup .<->1
Ordered delivery a few times . Food was fresh and hot . Service very friendly . Definitely recommend .<->1
I love this place - friendly staff and wonderful array of flavors available and really good mix - ins . I will be visiting this place again very soon ! ! !<->1
I recently got an order of nachos to go . The bar was n't too busy , but it took a long time for someone to take my order . However , the nachos were so so good . Huge portion . Delicious .<->1
Staff - AwesomeOwner - Crazy awesomeSelection - FantasticPrices - Good ( but I 'll pay more for personable people who know the product , so not an issue ) Location - Convenient<->1
The best Mexican food I 've ever had ... period . Salsas and queso make it an over the top experience . A must have if you live in or around Charlotte .<->1
Great pizza , best in downtown Las Vegas . prices are good service is very good and fast give it a shot if you 're downtown<->1
I ca n't believe it took me a year to find this gem . Breakfast is my favorite meal and Squeeze In is the best I 've found in Las Vegas . Great food and top - notch service !<->1
Had a great dinner here as they have an open wood burning grill for awesome ribeyes ! The shaved Brussels sprouts were just ok . The blt and market salads were very good !<->1
New location , same great food and much better atmosphere . Really love this place and just about everything on the menu . The service is extremely fast and friendly .<->1
Excellent sushi , excellent drink specials , finally a cool place right on the corner . This is the one that stays . If you go , tell them Member # 1184 sent you !<->1
Great experience . Great atmosphere . Yummy food . Will be back and they 're open til late .<->1
The one main reason I love Cheesecake Factory and the USA . PORTIONS ! ! ! The food and service here were great ! ! ! Price was reasonable . Did not disappoint on the dessert . Ca n't wait til Cheesecake Factory opens here in The 6 at Yorkdale<->1
I love this place , the food is always delicious . My kids and hubby are picky but they do enjoy coming here :) The restaurant its self is very nice and a perfect corner location .<->1
Attentive staff , good live music , & some great grapes . What more do you need ? Oh , show up Tuesdays for 1/2 priced bottles of vino ;-)<->1
I 'm not one to leave reviews , but tonight we received exceptional service . The gentleman who served us was great . I wish I got his name so he could get recognition for great service<->1
Great Italian food . Nice cozy dinner calimari was on point .. Adela was a great server !<->1
We walked in at lunch time today , and there was no menu anywhere so we asked the guy behind the counter who told us the menu was available online ! Seriously ? ! You guys ca nt even print out a piece of paper ?<->0
Definitely hits the spot when you 've got a classic poutine craving . Make sure to bring cash ! ! Only reason I 'm bringing a star down is because it 's cash only .<->1
Amazing ! ! The fish is so fresh and the sushi chefs will make anything custom . I will definitely come back .<->1
I do n't think this place is a authentic Chinese noodles restaurant ... for me it 's not wow ... the broth taste too much soya sauce ... and the pan fried beef bun was not fresh ...<->0
My favorite bartenders / servers ever ! ! ! Alisha , lisa and kathy are so great ! Attentive , professional and nice . We love , love , love their pizza<->1
A little smokey at times , but the food is good and service is great . Definitely a neighborhood favorite !<->1
Very good food and drinks . A bit pricey but the quality is there . Be prepared for a bit of pretentiousness . Mac and cheese was bomb !<->1
5 of us came for breakfast short wait at 9 a . m . we all had something different and all meals were very good outstanding waitress will be going back soon<->1
Above average for Chinatown sushi.there is a wait for all you can eat but it 's worth it .<->2
Sketchy neighborhood so be careful stopping at night . But they do offer . 89 sodas and this is the only reason we stopped .<->0
Panago Pizza is my number one take - out pizza resonant . They have a virility of salads and pizzas to choose from . Quite unique pizza choices . Not to mention cheap as well .<->1
This has got to be one of the best pizza I 've had and I 've had a lot of different pizzas to compare it to ! Too bad you do n't have one near my house . Great job guys !<->1
Do not bother going here . The prices are ridiculous , for food with no flavor . I paid $ 9.00 for a burrito ! The only good thing about this place is that it looks cute .<->0
The wonton soup had no flavor . The noodles were soggy and the orange chicken was soggy as well . I paid way too much money for my meal . I was very disappointed .<->0
Nothing special compare to other locations of guu . Food and drink are great . Service has nice attitude but they always bring our food to the people sitting beside us ( at the bar area ) which they did nt ordered lol .<->1
I 've eaten here a few times , it 's always been good . Love the sushi , num num num . Must try the short ribs , so yummy . Thanks everyone at Kabuki<->1
Great pastrami and corned beef sandwiches . Authentic and family - owned for 4 generations over 60 years . My kind of place .<->1
This place is awesome . It is a fabulous break from all the cookie cutter chains . I am currently 1/3 of the way through the menu and everything is amazing .<->1
HUGE FOOD PORTIONS ! ! ! Lots of different beer 's on tap ! Great cocktails ! Love the atmosphere and the service is always great ! You got ta try it !<->1
Typical Pei Wei . Kick ass food , hostess gives me a funny look when I order ( in all fairness my order is quite odd ) , and a killer Coke machine . Keeps us coming back again and again .<->1
So unbelievably pleased with the service and food ! Stopped here for brunch and got pancakes and yogurt - both of which exceeded my expectations !<->1
I had most of their dishes over the years . Their Lamb Souvlaki Dinner is awesome . Pizzas are good .<->1
You can pass on this place ! Food was n't that good . Plus the lady behind the gelato area needs to work on her customer service .<->0
Great atmosphere , great service , awesome appetizers . Crab cake was the best I 've had in a lo<->1
This place was absolutely delicious , heads up there might be a line to get in it is so tasty . The place was really tiny but the food and service was so good I did nt even mind too much .<->1
Our dinner tonight was great . Our server in the bar area was great we had southwest egg rolls and I had Chipotle honey chicken and waffles and it was great .<->1
Delicious chana masala soup of the day with a yummy half a hummus sandwich and a snickerdoodle cookie . all vegan and all so good and filling :) Very nice service as well !<->1
This establishment had an absolutely delightful ambiance . The food was delicious and the waiters and waitresses were on point . I will definitely be back .<->1
We came a lot every time was a great service with the same server named Ozzy . He is awesome and friendly .<->1
I tried the Padak fried chicken and the Kimchi fries with spicy pork . They were huge portion sizes and between the two of us , we can barely finish . Definitely will be coming again !<->1
Do n't be taken back by the strip mall location , this place has pleasantly sophisticated ambience , deliciously balanced menu , and terrific bar !<->1
Un des meilleurs sushi de la ville ! Service rapide et souriant , des plats a couper le souffle pour un prix très raisonnable ! Et en plus ils font a emporter , ideal pour les plateaux télés du dimanche soir ;)<->1
Great prices for great drinks . 50 oz of frozen drinks on hot summer days makes for all kinds of good<->1
Overpriced candy shop . Save your money and just go to Target , Walmart or other retailer if you need some candy .<->0
Unique , classy , quaint , best romantic outdoor patio bar with fireplace , awesome food and drinks ! Excellent service ! LOVE LOVE !<->1
" Got ta be a 5 " Why a 5 ? The pizza is excellent . Thin and crispy . The wine list is good and well priced for a change . Good location in the vinietian / palazzo<->1
I love this restaurant ! It might be my new favorite in Vegas . I have brought two of my foodie friends and they both LOVED the food ! The crispy duck panang is just awesome !<->1
Pretty good food , awesome online ordering and prompt delivery . Great addition to Robinson . Love the specialty pizzas ! Ca n't wait to try them all . The pesto chicken was amazing !<->1
Great drinks , great food , friendly staff , and fun Harry Potter ambiance ! If you check in with Yelp Bad Owl offers 20 % off your iced or blended drink . I love a good deal and I love this place !<->1
Spinach roll was great ! Love the Calamari ... berry salad was good but the chicken we added to salad needed some flavor . Kathrine was super friendly and attentive . Misters on the patio would be nice ! Over all happy hour experience was fabulous .<->1
This place was interesting . The service was a little slow and the food was good but nothing amazing . My favorite part was the coffee float that came with the lunch .<->1
Wonderful staff . Relaxed environment . Tasty food and reasonable prices for lunch . The sauce is so good I bought one to take home girl .<->1
Had the Carne asada tacos . The tortilla was dry , but the meat was ok . The place was n't clean and there was flies inside . For me I would n't go back .<->0
Not so well known but amazing burger joint at Mandalay Bay Place .. build your own burger as they add more options and available ingredients to the menu .<->1
Beware possible credit card scammer working here ! ! ! Make sure you see where your card is swiped .<->0
The food is great but every time I go here I seem to wait 20 minutes for seating , even when it 's not that crowded . The waiters rush around without glancing at the door and it just seems pretty rude .<->0
This place has been here forever , and while the decor is a little campy the food is honest and delicious . I 'm not a big fan of mexican , this place really shines .<->1
Chocolate and lots of it what 's not to love ! Varietys that are not available on the normal retail market ! Love that they give you samples too when you come in . Oh and their cupcakes are TO DIE FOR !<->1
This was soo good . A beautiful space with so many draft beers . I got one of the house brews and it was delicious . My tuna steak sandwich was amazing . It was seared perfectly and had a fantastic pink interior .<->1
Absolutely fabulous ! Why do so many people fixate on the location ? The food was super delicious , Mexican + seafood , where could things go wrong .<->1
Mediocre food , super fast service , good sangria . Unimpressed with the four dishes we had . Lamb chops were good . Polpo overcooked . Again ; very fast service . Fed and full in under an hour on a Friday night .<->2
They did a great job servicing our large party ( 30 plus people ) . Food and service were respectable and the ambiance was interesting .<->1
The food is now terrible . They went under renovation and just messed up the food ... Korma as no Cashew taste . The Vindaloo had uncooked potatoes and left us with an after taste of garlic powder and MSG ... Big order , small satisfaction .<->0
Staff here is awesome especially Edward , Jeff , and Victoria . These three always go out of their way to help the customer .<->1
This one of my favorite Thai restaurants ! The pineapple fried rice and basil fried rice are awesome !<->1
Came here for the poutine , had the one topped with onions , green peppers and mushroom . regular size is enough for 2 if you plan on snacking other food . Prompt service and non - pushy servers .<->1
Good sandwich shop and very friendly ... but good not great . For sure going back to try some other sandwiches but it 's not going to be something I crave because it was soooo phenomenal .<->2
Butter chicken here is delicious ! Staff was really good and the live band music was great , too . Just one thing I wish was there was ice cream but other than that the food is delicious !<->2
Outstanding Bfast spot . Huge portions ! Great hangover cure ! I recommend sharing the entrees family style .<->1
Best Tortas & mexican food in the state hands down , NOTHING comes close ! Now I am hungry !<->1
Amazing . Would go again in a second ! Got the farm house burger and sweet potato fries . Best I have ever had ! !<->1
This is basically my Friday night spot - - perfect place to wind down the week with some pasta and wine !<->1
Always a good place for a drink or a show . Their tacos are really good , and their mixed drinks are excellent . Highly recommend . Yay .<->1
Tasty burgers and a nice / cozy decor . Would n't go out of my way to reach it but will pick it for fast food if in the area .<->2
Overpriced for the quality of food and service . Might as well go to the strip for overpriced sushi . And no Mil Disc . If your gon na charge that much ... at least provide better specials or discounts .<->0
I 'm really glad I found this L & L not to far away.food made to order and always good huge plates . i especially like the BBQ chicken plate what more can I say Hawaiian food is my comfort food : )<->1
This is THE BEST pizza in Charlotte ! ! Every time we order , it 's consistently delicious ! Definitely a loyal customer !<->1
Two words : Holy sh * t ! Between the ice cream and the cookie , I was in heaven .<->1
Only been here a couple of times , but it is new favorite Thai restaurant in Vegas . Very reasonably priced . Favorite dished Shrimp Pad Thai and Garlic Eggplant with Fried Tofu<->1
Worse place you can ever go to honestly worst customer service . I 've never had this bad experience until now . Forgot to offer sauce and wrong drink plus no straw !<->0
My favorite is the mango tango . This place is heaven on a hot summer day .<->1
Stopped in here to get the onion rings ... why ca n't I find a place with good onion rings ? ? This place was n't an exception ... they were small and too greasy and they tasted like they were fried in old oil . ICK .<->0
Fantastic service , and excellent food . I really appreciated the range of vegetarian options ( all excellent ! ) and the friendliness of the service . We went here for an anniversary dinner and loved it . Will definitely be back !<->1
Live music performances daily during Winterlicious . There are all kinds of meat I can not even know all their names . They even have roast pineapples .<->1
When you are a wine distributor , there is no other place to take your clients . All sommeliers wants to go there and for a good reason , great service and great food . Live this place .<->1
This buffet is decent . Most of all , during special occasions the lines are super long . The bread pudding is my favorite there . The staff are nice and not rude .<->1
I wish it had negative stars ! ! ! Ugly waitress ! Horrible service ! Horrible place to be at ! Stay away from it ! Wo n't believe me ? ! Try it !<->0
Fabulous coffee , juices , smoothies , and other drinks . Definitely of the organic , natural , healthy variety . Love it ! Did not try any food , so ca n't comment on it .<->1
My go - to restaurant when the lady asks me what I want for supper . Love the soup and salad bar and I love all of their main courses ! If you like chicken , this is the place to go . Fantastic for families .<->1
Went here randomly after going kayaking on the water . It was the best soul food I have had in a while . This will be my new location when I am looking for my soul food fix !<->1
Food was lousy and not authentic . Got the California burrito and they put French fries inside . Who does that ? Fries ended up soggy and burrito was bland . Mediocre pork carnitas . Only redeemer was salsa . Good salsa . Service very slow .<->0
Best Chicken Mole in the WORLD ! ! ! Needs to be on your Bucket List .<->1
We went back last weekend at 6:30 pm but their door was locked . No explanation .<->1
Excellent Sonoran hot dog with great toppings and flavor ! Thank you for the experience of the specialty stuffed cream cheese . On another level .<->1
Not really sure why the low rating . We almost did n't come because . But sure glad we did . Turkey burger was on point and the Beer Can chicken sandwich was good too . Certainly not a 2.5 star place .<->1
Anatolia offers great Turkish food , very authentic well spiced and plenty of choices . The staff are well trained , knows their menu very well and very patient to explain everything .<->1
So delicious ! Exceptional customer service ! ! ! Cheddar crust is the best :) you can buy pies frozen and have them freshly made !<->1
Great bun rieu ! Great pho ! Excellent service . Very cool fish tank . Overall one of the best Vietnamese restaurants in the area .<->1
Not really impressed . I spent nearly $ 10 for two tacos , rice beans and a drink . The tacos were okay , kind of bland actually . For the money I feel like I could do better elsewhere .<->2
I love this place ! good customer service and good food . It 's my go to sushi spot !<->1
Very good ! Very quick ! Great quality for a very affordable price ! Strongly recommend !<->1
Great service and food ! Waiter was excellent , very knowledgeable of the entire menu leading us in the right direction . We 'll be back !<->1
A great find . Gumbo and smoked wings are excellent . Perfectly seasoned . Mac and cheese is creamy and tasty . Gourmet cajun food , how can you go wrong ?<->1
The food is delicious , especially the karaage . If you like Japanese food then you should try this place .<->1
The flat steak and frites was terrific ! The ambiance on the terrace was perfect . If we were here another day I would be tempted to go back .<->1
Good Pizza , good drink specials . Pretty typical for a Pizza Place . If you are looking for a good place to go with the family or some friends for Pizza you could definitely do worse than this place .<->1
Absolutely incredible pastrami ! Have n't had anything like it outside NYC . Oh and the sercive ? Top notch . Very friendly staff who made me feel at home . Highly recommended if you 're in the downtown area . Perfect before a game !<->1
Definitely our family favorite place to go ! Love the French dip and the code steak salad ! Amazing glazed carrots never disappoint ! White chocolate martini is a must have !<->1
Probably the worst bloody mary I 've ever had ! Did n't try the food .<->0
I love ' the human bean ' ! The coffee is wonderful , the service is always amazing and I am so glad I now live so close !<->1
Really dirty place ! I got a fly in my water and the manager did not want to help me . I 'm not gon na come again worst service ever !<->0
Great price and great sushi . White tuna was the best ! Went in around midnight and still got a good selection on the revolving conveyor . Some plates do look old but most were fresh and great . Had 10 plates and under 30 dollars total !<->1
Everyone at our table raved about their meals , the appetizers were wonderful and our deserts were amazing . Glad we found this place - it was worth the 25 mile drive ! We will come again next time we 're in the valley .<->1
Best spicy wontons ! ! ! Must try this unassuming spot . Great lunch specials and also a great spot for dinner . Reasonably priced and quick service .<->1
My first time trying these cookies were when I visited Madison . Their white chocolate macadamia cookies are the best . They 're open late but they 're cookies never taste old , always fresh . This is the best place to get cookies from .<->1
Nasty dirty table . No wonder we have a flu epidemic in this country ! It 's too bad Starbucks has gone so down hill . Filthy seems to be their new norm . Bummer .<->0
We love this neighborhood spot . The wait staff , food , and patio are what keep drawing us back .<->1
Great place to have in Surprise ! Everyone was super friendly and the restaurant was clean . We had the orange chicken , lemon chicken , and lo mein . All very good and delicious !<->1
This place is inside sandwich box . It 's a great addition to this lunchtime essential . The coffee is good and the sandwich selection is cheaper than the Box .<->1
I love IN - N - OUT Burger ! I 'd say , the best and healthiest fast food place around .<->1
Need good Beer ? They have itWant excellent Wine at a great price ? They have itLooking for wine accessories ? They have itGreat Service ? They got it<->1
Great brunch , great service . Our server Grant was especially friendly and accommodating . This will be one of our go to spots when out of towners come to visit . The breakfast food was fresh , not greasy , and delicious !<->1
Rib eye perfectly cooked , baked potato deliciously coated in salt ... drinks perfect ! Highly recommend for a great steak dinner in Mesa . Our server Holly and Jeff the manager were both so attentive and professional ... absolutely great meal .<->1
The food tastes like it came from the freezer . The salsa is horrible . The chimichanga we got was too salty . The service is good but the food is horrible<->0
She 's done my sons Birthday cakes 2 years in a row and I 'm never dissapointed . Her work is amazing and the cake & filling are delicious . I 'd definitely recommend her !<->1
Delicious tamales made with New Mexico Hatch chile ... Generous portions served at a very reasonable price ! If you like it HOT , ask for the Owner Brian ' s red salsa ... Tomato going in ... Fire going down ! ! ! Come se dice ' delicioso ?<->1
Best pizza in town . Tyler is great , always gives consistent fantastic food and service .<->1
Perfect for privet parties , lunch or dinner with friends . Great drinks . Nice salads and the have heavier items as well . Parking could be a problem at peak times but worth the trouble .<->1
Fantastic food , great choice and outstanding service . Money well spent , think even better than Bellagio .<->1
New location for what used to be the Pearl of the Orient across the road . Same staff and excellent food . Gone is the kitsch decor and now it 's modern Asian .<->1
Delicious grilled salmon and greenbean lunch ! I paid 3 times as much at other restaurants and it tasted half as good . Def recommend !<->1
Prime rib Italian and some seafood options are okay but the rest of the food is pretty bland<->1
Was on business and and 4 of us had a great waiter , food and the service was awesome ! I from the bay area and slightly high maintenance when eating out . This place was superb !<->1
The food is good and is out fairy quick . The staff is very nice . The is a bit pricey for what you get . We have been there twice and the entire family enjoyed it both times .<->1
This is our go to dinner place . Great service and great food ! Orange chicken and sweet and sour chicken is our order usually .<->1
In an ever - increasingly overpriced town , this may be the worst value I 've experienced here in Vegas . A wide variety of mediocre food and less - than - enthusiasts service in an unremarkable setting , all at an unusually high price . Just . Not . Worth . It .<->0
Crazy good burgers ! If yer not afraid of rich , cheesy - mayo decadence get yerself a melting pot .<->1
Terrible service . Nothing like getting yelled at because you finished your meal , asked for your drink which never came and then asked for them to remove it from the bill . Classy<->0
Best fish Tacos in the western US . Great food excellent service you have to try this place . Calamari is great and my wife lives the grilled fish with rice .<->1
Service is not that extraordinary but the food ... Oh boy , that 's another story ! Because of this restaurant I am absolutely in love with Ethiopian food , it tastes wonderful and I crave injera all the time ! !<->1
My favorite place to take the kids for a special treat . And for a grown up popsicle for me . They were made fresh . Kids loved the topping choices and had fun choosing what to put on their pops .<->1
I had the medium hot wings and fries so it was pretty simple but good ! Service was also good but it was n't that busy either . Will come again<->1
Best bar food and staff in town ! Clam chowder on Friday and prime rib Saturday is a must !<->1
Very good ribs and wings . The bbq sauce in Pittsburgh is weird , sort of horseradishy . but good . Drew is the grillmaster ! This is strictly carry out , but there is a picnic table out front if you are interested ,<->1
Hands down , one of the best Italian meals my wife and I have had in years ! That includes Giovanni 's , where we were a few weeks ago . And the price point is much more manageable .<->1
Cool place . Must be good , local police eat here ! Biscuit bowl , cheesy hash browns , fruit bowl . Very tasty and very reasonable ! !<->1
Brought our friends while they visit us . We always brought friends here while they visit us . This price for this buffet is increasing but quality is getting worse and worse . It 's not worth at all .<->0
Bet Thai Iced Tea and Coffee anywhere ! Great food , too ! We always stop in whenever we are in Vegas . Service is excellent , prices are good .<->1
Out of the park , they where amazing on each position style of truck , customer service , and of course the food .. I will be returning to the truck . Must try ..<->1
Fabulous dining experience . Superb staff , great recommendations and marvelous service . Appetizers and main courses were simply delightful . Place could benefit from more secluded seating and dimmer lighting . Optional outside seating is a nice touch , Highly recommend .<->1
A little piece of Italy . Authentic food at reasonable prices . Massimo is friendly , amazing and even has the accent . Great Greek salad .<->1
Service is lacking but the food is okay . I would n't be seen frequently here , for sure .<->2
The thai food is ok . Not as good as basil thai in my opinion . Have n't had the chance to try their sushis yet though .<->2
This place was over hyped . ... breakfast was not worth the price ! Its a very nice atmosphere ... good view of the strip and that s about it .<->2
Fish was fresh and just like I like it . I thought the french fries were very tasty . Excellent customer service too . And you ca n't beat the sales are having right now for $ 1.99 one piece of fish and french fries .<->1
On of my favorite restaurants in Charlotte . I have been to 300 East a bunch of times - the food is consistently delicious and service is always been good . It is also an absolutely adorable place .<->1
This place sucks ! The owner is a retard for only scheduling one employee in a busy location .<->0
Honestly , I have nothing new to add . But , I want whoever on the internet that might be stalking me to know that I 've been here .<->1
If you like soggy crust and extra salty pizza my husband says this place is for you ! ( This is the best Vegas had to offer ? ) They did deliver and it was fast , but , gee ...<->0
The best burger I ate since arrived at CA ... And the fries with parmesan ... Nhamiii ! ! ! Loved everything ... Even the price ... Too fair ! ! ! ;-) Just the wait time ... Not so cool . :-( But ok , nothing like : OMG . Haha .<->1
The potatoes for breakfast were so crunchy I could n't penetrate them with my fork :( The AM Bloody Mary 's were excellent . I think with so many options in the area , I would not go back .<->0
Great place to chow down . The Margherita Pizza I ordered was delicious with fresh ingredients . My dessert which was the Tiramisu ranks high above rest , It 's very tasty . Service was respectful and pleasant . Enjoy ! Must Try<->1
Mediocre at best . You go pay for a burrito , you eat the burrito . Nothing more to this place and certainly not memorable . I will still come back .<->2
Awsome food and service ! Diana was our waitress ! Wow what can I say ! So would go there again when we are in town !<->1
I placed a large order for pick up , and was pleasantly surprised that everything was 100 % correct and fresh and delicious ! Thank you for making my sushi day with my kiddos awesome !<->1
I 'm always excited when my boss takes us to Pappadeaux but I 'm never really happy with my food . The staff is polite and they handle our large groups real well .<->2
The restaurant was clean and the level of service by the staff and portion size were on target , but the chicken burrito was extremely salty and the music playing was unnecessarily loud .<->0
The Imperial Burger and the IPA Burger was amazing . Low price but great quality of food would recommend it to anyone . We both loved the truffle fries .<->1
Service took forever and food was ehhhhh ... We had a party of 7 and the waiter acted like we were an inconvenience for her . Wo n't be back there again .<->0
Great food and excellent customer service . Very friendly and hospitable . A great place to take your family or friends for birthdays or happy hour .<->1
Really good , overly stuffed tacos ! Quick service , with lots of food to choose from on the menu . We will be back soon ! !<->1
Yumm AHHHHMAZING .. drinks were good and the food was to die for ! I highly recommend if your in Vegas .<->1
Great customer service ! My boyfriend and I got the chicken shawarma sandwich and it was so good . I will definitely be coming back .<->1
They have their liquor license now ! ! The food is still delicious every time , as always . Now you can enjoy a refreshing mimosa as well . Vegetarian friendly , great service , what more could you ask for ?<->1
Empty restaurant should have been a clue . And when they did not acknowledge my open table reservation , thus losing my points for dining ... this was going down the road of disaster . Disappointment . Can not recommend .<->0
Went in here a few times this week , food was fast and good as usual . Blonde girl on the counter was cool too .<->1
Great food , and atmosphere . Joseph Kicklighter was an excellent attentive server . Make sure you try the ribs .<->1
Herr 's potato chips and tortilla chips taste great . And the tour was a lot of fun .<->1
Awesome service from Mike & a great atmosphere ! Had the Reuben , Mufalletta , & Cuban sandwiches and they were all fantastic ! High quality ingredients at affordable prices . Will definitely be going back !<->1
have to ask for refills and waitress just stands around after taking your order everyone walks around with an attitude and its depressing and horrible service . this will be the last time I come here<->0
The place was clean , the service was so nice , the food was good especially crab Rangoon and ka - prao . Because it Saturday so it too many people .<->1
Amazing food ! ! Everything we ordered was spot on and we ca n't wait for more . Hummus , grape leaves ( both ) , gyro , falafel and beef Schwarma sandwiches we delicious ! Wish we found this place years ago !<->1
Bomb food real authentic Mexican food . No added flavor salsa on point .. really delicious ! ! !<->1
We lived in the Thailand for years and this place is legit . Be warned : If you order the Thai Hot its as hot as it gets ! This is not Americanized Thai , its the real thing !<->1
Great comfort food , cheesy sauce and a smiling crew . I stopped by for the classic Mac and bites while they 're downtown . Great lunch .<->1
A diamond in the rough . Excellent food . From the honey pecan chicken to the country fried pork .. good eats<->1
The service was great and the pizza was even better ! The deep dish here is as close to being in Chicago as it gets . The pizza takes a while to bake , but so worth the wait .<->1
I tried the summer garden salad and I loved it . The great service from people like Jenna make this place though ! Great atmosphere and great food ! Yumm<->1
Overrated ! A tasty burger but I guess you ca n't expect to get Gordon Ramsay class meal in 30 $<->2
Cozy BYOB establishment for sophisticated new French cuisine and tasting menus . Romantic and affordable depending on your menu selection . Always enjoy my meal there .<->1
I had the pleasure of being treated to Tuscany Grill 's catering at work ! Super fresh ingredients and I appreciated vegetarian / vegan options .<->1
This was the worst poutine I 've ever had . It was entirely flavourless and the fries became really soggy . The service was friendly enough - nothing special though .<->0
These tacos as so good . And the quest and chips are a perfect blend of cheese and seasoning .<->1
This place is very cool inside . Awesome decor . Food was good . Wine is pricey and everyone seems very nice<->1
I 've been to lunch here once . The food was really good . ( fried pickles were delicious but a tad greasy ) The service was quick and the waitress as pretty funny and witty . I 'll be back for sure .<->1
Such a cute cafe ! I stopped by here with my family on our Vegas trip . There was plenty of seating and many drink options to choose from . I 'll be back next time !<->1
Everything was good , but only one server for the entire restaurant is n't appealing for a great serviceexperience .<->1
it was an awesome place and i definitely love the italian / japanese fusion . i 'm for sure coming back again .<->1
Loved it . Chicken was perfectly seasoned . Sauces are exceptional . Cilantro infused rice is my favorite side . I was skeptical that my kids would like it . They are picky eaters that are ages 13 and 8 , but they loved it as well .<->1
The atmosphere and waitress are pretty cool . They do n't have half the menu items . ` The food took FOREVER ! May give it another try .<->2
Had some good coffee and heard the food was good . Maybe I 'll try it next time . Service was great and price was right . Could use a good cleaning but they 're pretty busy . I 'll be back .<->2
OMG ! My wife had to admonish me to not moan while eating . We split a LTD and all those meats were terrific . We also had the sautéed green beans , pasta salad , and sweet potato fries . We 'll be back .<->1
I 'm sure the food and desserts are great ... but I just needed some water . I was totally dehydrated . I think it 's a bit much to charge $ 5.41 for water .<->0
This place is great ... I go for lunch often . Try the meatloaf and you wo n't be sorry . I love these mom and pop places . Great job !<->1
it was my first time trying this place and I must say the food was pretty good . The customer service was great and the food comes out fast . I ordered the oxtail pho and it was pretty tasty .<->1
Love this place ! Very convenient and yummy authentic Chinese food . Definitely not cheap curious meat Chinese food !<->1
My first and last time . Not much flavor in the food . Fried rice was soggy and hot and sour soup was weak on all accounts<->0
My husband and I have gotten take - out twice now . Pretty good food and the staff is always very friendly . We will definitely continue to go back . Prices are extremely reasonable and order has never been wrong .<->1
Good place for people interested in trying Indian food for the first time . Not as many items as they claim and usually they are slow at re stocking the food . Little bit overpriced IMO aswell<->2
Ordered a chocolate cake with banana cream filling and buttercream frosting & white cake cupcakes for my dad 's birthday party , it was incredible , by far the best cake I have severed . Everyone joyed it very much .<->1
Good food and beer . Came here form out of town .<->1
Super service . Kinda too " resorty " food . Limited menu . Food was good but not everyone likes rosemary potatoes for breakfast . Plain potatoes or hash browns are easy to add . We will be back . :)<->1
Lauren is amazing . If she 's not managing she should be . Awesome worker with great customer service . It was literally the end of the night and she was still smiling and sweet . Food was bomb as always !<->1
Food the way it was meant to be cooked not processed or salty like a lot of other restaurants yet delicious great food at a good price ca n't go wrong<->1
Really good Bbq and reasonably priced . One star deduction because they seem to always be running out of different menu items .<->1
Two breakfast sandwiches and a grilled cheese , delivered within 20 minutes ( granted , it was across the street , but still ... ) gives four stars ! Next , the namesake dogs ...<->1
Wonderful breakfast restaurant . Very nice staff . Fresh delicious food . Highly recommend .<->1
Good , clean , neighborhood Chinese restaurant . Food is always cooked well , service is great and the place always looks very clean . I find the food better than big heng and Bo Bo china which are also by my house .<->1
Nice restaurant , the atmosphere was great , food is excellent and most importantly the waiters were really nice and accommodating .<->1
I wanted this place to be like chop't ... but it was n't . The selection is super limited . Like they only have Spinach and baby kale for lettuce ... I wo n't be back<->0
Cute place , nice location , yummy food . What else do I need to say ? My omelet was perfectly cooked and the potatoes passed the test ! Prices were pretty decent too woot woot !<->1
Its just great so greatLove it !<->1
My second favourite bagel place in Montreal .<->1
Freindly staff ... good cheese ... ca n't wait to try the aftermentioned " # 7 "<->2
Such a cute and quaint , place ! Great place to get quality coffee and a good snack . They also collaborate with other local small businesses which I really appreciate about them !<->1
One of my longtime favorites in the Annex . Noteworthy for vegetarians , they have an extensive selection of interesting veggie sushi rolls .<->1
Best sushi in Lakewood . Come here at happy hour for best prices : $ 5 apps , sushi rolls and glasses of wine . We always have amazing service here as well .<->1
Delicious Factory is DELICIOUS.Probably one of the best options on Mill Ave . Fresh , fairly priced and local . The food is so good ! Fresh juices , smoothies , salads , breakfast bowls , sandwiches , coffee etc . Great addition to Mill .<->1
Everything was served hot and fresh . Our waitress , Elanor was very nice and friendly . Overall , a great experience . Thanks !<->1
Just finished my second visit and had to recommend Craft Kitchen . Their coffee is awesome and ca n't wait until they roll out the baguettes and baguette sammy 's . Get in there and support this great new Henderson spot .<->1
I went here last month with my family . We ordered a few of the pasta dishes and also got free cheesy garlic bread . The owner was really friendly and the service was excellent , I would definitely go back .<->1
Straight flamas . My boy Waylon was a wizard with his ice cream sorcery . The boba was great and it 's literally right next to a sushi place . They roll ice cream better than y' all do blunts<->1
Great food ! ! ! Went there for lunch with the family . Very outstanding service ! ! My 1 year old made some mess but they understood ! ! Well return again ! !<->1
My husband enjoyed the Nasi goreng . Nice ambiance and attentive staff . Would definitely recommend and come back .<->1
There was absolutely nothing freaky fast about getting my meal . The staff was incompetent and messed up multiple orders before receiving mine . Complete lack of competence coming from this restaurant .<->0
The burgers here are some of the best in the city . Incredibly unhealthy in the most delicious sense . The pizza is good and the fries have a different , sweet seasoning on them . Pretty good place for a great burger .<->1
First time there . Had rolled tacos with guacamole and cheese . Great price for a belly full of good food . Quick service also . I will return to try out some more dishes .<->1
Not greeted . Had to go to counter to get drinks refilled . Food seems to be preprepared my steak tips were rubbery and onions and peppers also like rubber . Wo n't be returning<->0
I love this place . It has the best shrimp fried rice I 've ever had . It also has very good egg flower soup that has chicken in it . Large portions , good prices , tasty food .<->1
The restaurant was out of almost everything on the menu for brunch . The server did n't really seem to be happy to help us . Will most definitely not return .<->0
The cut of the week is a good deal especially if you can throw back some vino ! How can you go wrong with a steakhouse at the Four Seasons ? ! Good service !<->1
First visit here .. came during the week - great time to come in . Service was excellent .. ramen was awesome ! Will definitely come back<->1
Went because a friend recommended it . Mediocre in my opinion . Panda Express meets Taco Bell . I had the red chicken and jerk fried rice . Beans are bad either one you get . Best part was snicker doodle .<->2
Love this place ! ! Portions are huge and the food is always on point . Friendly staff and they also have a rewards program !<->1
The filet nachos heck yes good ! The husband also had the scorpion shot . Little pricey but worth it , it 's Vegas . Also thanks for the margarita with a yelp check in !<->1
It would be nice if they answered their phone so I could place a to go order . Called a dozen times and no answer . Went to Tacos Mexicanos instead ! Adios Dos Cornoas<->0
Ordered the Croquette Monsieur which was good but not the best I 've had . Coffee was good too . Prices were steep to accommodate the fanciness of the cafe , but at least they were half the price of their restaurant next door .<->2
I like Wendy 's but this one is no good . The interior is sad and the chicken sandwiches were no good . Clearly , the worst wendy 's i have been to .<->0
A good location conveniently located off of 215 and Decatur . Store is laid out opposite of most Walmarts .<->2
I was pleasantly surprised with this find . I found it through the reviews on Yelp . Food was tasty . Cost was reasonable . For us , the location is great . Will definitely be returning .<->1
Absolutely amazing . Great food . Generous ( maybe too generous ) portions . Definitely recommend .<->1
In todays Champaign paper , it says that they got a health rating of 25 out of 100 .<->0
The wife and I come here all the time and the food is always great and the service is spectacular ! ! !<->1
Had Valentine 's dinner on the patio and a most romantic setting ever . Our server was absolutely amazing . Our dinner was even better . And the surroundings or entertaining<->1
What a lovely place ! Excellent service , delicious food and great beverages ! ! The bulgogi burger was an amazing surprise ! Definitely recommend this place if you 're looking for filling food and good cocktails .<->1
They bring out three kinds of great salsa with every meal ! The food is good , not great but the price is right . Great for lunch .<->2
The pho was good but I had better . The workers are nice and attentive .<->2
This resto is cozy and very welcoming . The food is great plus affordable , deliciously filling . The service is good too . Gone there 3 days in a row since I could n't get enough of their dukkboki & the ramyum one too !<->1
Great pizza , great service . This is an excellent example of a locally - owned family restaurant .<->1
Awesome food . If every meal is as I ate it ... dude murders it . Tenders ... bomb ... Pizza ... bomb ... sandwich is out to jury but promising<->1
Everything about this place is wonderful . Friendly staff , not too sweet frapps and pastries , good music , and your food and drinks are brought to you . Best coffee shop experience I have had<->1
Hole in the wall but the pizza is amazing ! Very dive bar feeling inside but the live music is a bonus . Pools tables are a nice addition . Bathrooms could use some attention .<->1
The sandwiches and soup are an incredible combination here . We tried the club , salmon and Mediterranean sandwiches . Perfect portions that leave just enough room for the desserts as you check out .<->1
First impression very bad server ... Forgot the beer n the edamame ... the sushi itself was delicious but very ordinary ... Oh and the sweetheart roll was gross , the honey mustard mayo was miracle whip ... Big disappointment .<->0
I read some reviews and decided to check it out . I have been impressed with the incredible breakfast burrito ! It was a great place to meet with my friend . Highly recommend this place .<->1
Good Twinsburg bar ! Paninis are not as good as DT but they have a fanatic patio , decent prices and always something going on . Great place for after work happy hour or keeping the night local .<->1
The jerk chicken sandwich is delicious and ~ $ 5 ( pretty good ) . It 's ready in a couple of minutes and the cashier is always nice !<->1
Man this place is BOMB . They have a ton of salsas . I highly recommend it .<->1
A small café full of charm , few seats inside , sunny ones outside , great coffee ( one of the best Mocha I had so far ) And not even 3 $ for a bagel with cream cheese on it ? Yes , I like that<->1
Absolutely amazing views and food for the most part was fantastic . However , the accompaniments to the main crab dish were lukewarm and very clearly reheated ... Pretty disappointing for such a pricey restaurant . Great service .<->1
Was expecting more for the price . Food had no taste to it . A lot of variety , just no good flavor .<->0
First time here . I had the 7th St sliders . Three sliders one chicken one burger and one trip tip . All three were real good . I will definitely come back to try something else .<->1
This place was excellent . The prices ca n't be beat . The staff was extremely friendly and accommodating . Food is great . We went for a birthday . They made it super fun .<->1
Nice place beautiful fixtures and decor . The menu is limited and nothing to write home about . Wine is a bit pricey .<->0
Best bagels I ve ever had ! I visit a few times a month and I have probably tried 80 % of the menu , nothing is bad ! Try the different flavors of cream cheese , the garlic one is so good !<->1
Not all Amir are the same . This one is especially good . Every time I 've eaten there I 've been very satisfied . Avoid the one on St - Denis ... it 's gross .<->1
Absolutely rude ! Came in at 9:40- doors open customers in line and the girl from behind the counter yells - we 're closed . So why is the door open ? That 's fine - we wo n't be back .<->0
Good variety but extremely expensive $ 34 per person for dinner . The gelato is very good . Steak is on the raw side ( bloody ) . Will probably not come back .<->2
Stopped in for happy hour . Service was terrible , slow and rude waitress . The food was ok . It was so smokey from the kitchen my eyes were burning and after leaving all of my clothes smelled . Wo n't be going back .<->0
I have such fond memories of Orange Julius from when I was a kid . And you know what they are still really really good . The only reason I gave them a four ? It 's kind of expensive ! ! !<->1
The food here is so good . Super flavourful , really interesting and still very unpretentious . And the service is awesome . Super friendly ownership .<->1
Best tacos in town period ! ! ! Cool atmosphere and great food . Lots of seating , and a nice bean bar and salsa stand . Great service and food ! Best spot in Vegas .<->1
Go - to restaurant in Cleveland ! Love the Thai peanut bowl but everything on the menu is great and healthy . Fun place to be .<->1
i would 've given this place a higher rating ... but how come a chicken sandwich that would cost $ 3.99 elsewhere , cost $ 6.49 at this place ?<->2
Passed by the place dozens of times and always thought it was out of business . Tried it tonight and its really good . Tried the plain cheese pizza and was impressed , good pizza and good value as well .<->1
Best service , delicious appetizers , and a beautiful view of the Bellagio fountains and the strip .<->1
The best beef brisket I ever had ! Service was awesome ! It was my first time there . It certainly wo n't be my last ! ! ! Awesome ! ! !<->1
Excellent service ! Their manager , Clayton was very accommodating and wonderful to work with when I had a special request for a large group .<->1
I still love this place and it 's still the best eats in Fountain Hills but the food on my last 2 visits has been so severely over - salted that we could barely eat it . Please guys ... pay attention !<->1
THE BEST THAI FOOD IN GLENDALE ! ! ! Seriously . The prices are so decent and the food is fantastic every time ! ! Not to mention their Thai tea is the Bomb .<->1
It was the " bomb " of a burger . I had the one with the unagi and it was worth the price . The bread / bun made it even better . It was a toasted sweet bread like . I m definite going back .<->1
Went there on a Friday evening and the dining area was nearly empty . Service was quite slow . As for the food , it was okay . Perhaps will give it another visit ...<->2
This place has the best Mexican food ever . Large portions and great chips , salsa , and cheese dip ! Really love the service also .<->1
Best place for soup and sandwich ... Great service and food ! Autumn squash soup really good and get it with any half sandwich , makes a great combo !<->1
excellent food and service . Shelly is in charge and is a gracious hostess .<->1
Yummy food with a lot of options . We have had sushi and Thai and both were great . Caught a special on Tues and Thurs during happy hour timing and enjoyed a huge variety appetizers and sushi .<->1
I hate McDonald 's but my kids like a happy meal every once and awhile . this is a nice location since they redid the inside .<->1
Tried the mocha eclair , tiramisu , and canoli . They were really stale and dry . Quite disappointing because they looked amazing .<->0
TOURIST TRAP ! beware .. I only ended up here cause it was pretty late and it was the only place in this area that was open and looked semi decent . Prices are high and the food is just ok .<->0
Great local place . Pizza is great and the hoagies are amazing . We eat here at least 3 times a month and have never had a bad experience .<->1
First time at a P . F . Chang 's and the bartender pointed me in the right direction food wise . Had the Kung pao chicken and it did not disappoint . Friendly staff and good food !<->1
Pretty unique Vegas buffet . It goes beyond your typical buffet selections , which was cool . Everything I tried was pretty good .<->1
INSANELY HORRIBLE SERVICE . But excellent food . The graveyard breakfast country fried steak is a killer !<->2
Probably need a few more trips to town to get through the details here but I sure did enjoy the kielbasa trimmed and beat salad . Unreal flavor experience .<->1
Pizza is Old school I love it ! lots of Cheese , god toppings , good service , good prices for a local bar . Draft beer kinda tastes funny all the time so I suggest bottles .<->1
everyone employee was super personable . very nice , very laid back . great drinks , great food . dinner for 2 was like $ 30 + tip . my partner and i are new to the area . we felt very welcomed here at the welcome diner !<->1
Got the Fire and Ice , and I do n't know what it was that did it , but my spirit sang on the first bite . The place was crowded , but the food was SO worth it !<->1
My boyfriend brought me these amazing Caramel Truffles ... I ca n't wait to visit and try the cakes ! ! ! THE BEST CHOCOLATES EVER THOUGH ! ! !<->1
Amazing food , great prices . They serve three salsas with the free chips they give you , all of which were delicious !<->1
Closed on Sunday ? ? ! ! How can a bar be closed on Sunday ? I was really disappointed as I went one day and they were closed ... Boo !<->2
Kaizen on Paradise Rd is great . I like there Japanese Tai and the Blue Fin Toro melts in my mouth . The price is good compared to the strip restaurants . Must come try this place out<->1
ATE MY FINAL MEAL HERE before I left for college . Food was amazing , the bartenders wished me good luck . This was the perfect place to have what might be my last substantial meal before coming home for Thanksgiving .<->1
Great homemade sandwiches . Very authentic ! ! The family that runs the place was very nice and attentive . Many flavors of different Macs N Cheeses . Pretty good just a little dry<->1
Very tasty tacos but Los Taquitos is better .<->2
Very nice staff ! The wrap I ate was tight and yummy ! Just enough dressing and no snapback from the chicken . The cucumber salad was tart and great . Will go back again . Close to work and quick !<->1
Good but not the real deal . The big 3 pizza deep dish places in Chicago I feel are better .<->2
D - Vine has been a top local fixture for 10 + years . DV is consistently excellent in its culinary offerings ... and the vino is pretty good too .<->1
This is by far my favourite dim sum place in the city . It get really busy on weekends but the room is huge so you wo n't wait long . Cart service only runs over the lunch hour .<->1
I wanted to like this place . I really did . But the fried fish was tough and the french fries only luke warm . The chocolate shake was the redeeming value .<->0
Great sweets ! Found on yelp got a free caramel gemme which was delicious ! So happy and will definitely return . Was craving macaroons . They also do cakes and other specialty pastries .<->1
Our waiter , Vince , was amazing . The food was great ! Definitely coming back again . The scorpion shots were a delightful treat .<->1
Food was not well spiced and the lamb khorma was sweet ( sugar added ) . Service subpar .<->0
Great donuts and friendly service I highly recommend & good coffee . I have no idea what the guy was complaining about the owners English was fine<->1
Perfect brewery / pub on all counts . Great food , excellent service accompanied by local ASU talent - who 'd hate this place ? Not sure what else to add . :) . Enjoy Tempe !<->1
We went for a Sunday afternoon Ice Cream with our puppy .. The manager advised the girl working the drive thru that they Do Not participate in Pup Cups :( ... We wo n't be back ..<->0
Friendly service . The bul - go - gi is very good ! Shrimp Yakisoba as well . ( I do n't do spicy dishes ) . The side dishes that come with it are hit and miss , mostly hits though .<->1
Dude , it 's gourmet burgers in a sweet spot in Las Vegas . That should sell itself . Good for lunch if you 're staying at Paris or Bally 's . Casual atmosphere<->1
Love the ambiance . The service was very polite and did n't rush us . The food was delicious . Loved the cheese platter . It was perfect for a mother / daughter lunch . Definitely returning in September !<->1
Cheese steaks sandwich with cheese wiz is really good . But my only gripe is that for a giant cheese steak sandwich combo is a little exp<->1
The food was good and the service was excellent ! Our server , Susan , was very attentive and friendly . We 've eaten here before and have always had excellent service .<->1
Awesome fajitas , great portions ! Their happy hour is really worth it , excellent specials . Do not underestimate their fajita quesadilla - delicious ! We would go more often if it was n't all the way across town from us .<->1
Menu has n't changed in a decade . Staff is rude . Prices are outrageous . Shut it down . We can use the space for something .<->0
This is my new favorite place in Vegas ! First time going was tonight an from food to singing everything was truly perfect ! Real Italian food very welcoming owners and attentive server ! I simply could nt be happier !<->1
I loved this restaurant . From the ambiance to the menu to the food and especially the check - - huevos ranchero and coffee under $ 9 - - it was all great . I 'll be back .<->1
Great little taco shop in the car wash . Very clean . They have a great salsa bar . I had three tacos all were delicious . I definitely recommend them . Ca n't wait to come back and try a burrito .<->1
One thing worth missing about Albuquerque is the food . This restaurant brings the unique New Mexican cuisine I love to the city I love .<->1
Solid Vietnamese for Phoenix and Arizona . Nice people . Typical mom - pop Pho place you 'd find anywhere . Nothing truly negative . Comfort food .<->1
Delicious delicious delicious ! It 's very busy and there 's a line at the front . But it 's worth the wait . The price is so goooood ! I ll go back again . It 's a filling meal .<->1
Great spot , with a limited but good menu . Very hidden , but somehow I have found this place 2 times by accident ... so maybe the placement is genius ... Anyhow good beer selection , and great staff .<->1
First timer , found on Yelp . I wanted hard she 'll tacos , had beef . Pretty good . I would not order the chips and salsa . The chips were burnt and the salsa was slushy .<->1
The only place that does n't charge for a side of ranch Bar tender had great recommendations for beer . I was skeptical about the limited menu ... grilled cheese or cheese board only but the pepperoni and siracha grilled cheese was the<->1
Best pizza evergreat pizza you can taste the quality i love the idea of small cut slices<->1
The smoothies are as good as any of the big chains . They also have killer wraps ! The Apple granola wrap is out of this world !<->1
Love this place ! Went for my first time ever and was blown away at how well the shop was . Customer service was excellent . I will be coming back for sure !<->1
I 'm visiting here and was recommended to this place . What great food , atmosphere , and of course the beer . Prices where very reasonable . Excellent<->1
It is cheap and fast . That s really about it . Service is good and it is barely more than fast food joints and better food .<->2
This is a fantastic place to go for a spectacular breakfast . The food is outstanding and the portions very generous . The owner Joe and his wife welcome people in and say goodbye as they leave . This is worth the drive .<->1
2nd time here . We NEED to come more often . We had the beef tacos this time . They are hands down the best we 've ever had . Nice folks too !<->1
If you are looking for brunch in Cleveland , this is the best option ! This place is absolutely killer ! Go here , get a side of the Pecan Bacon , and enjoy it . It 's the best !<->1
Yummy Chips and Salsa ! If your up for something new try a MALIBU MELON MARGARITA , only made at Pedro 's , It 's delicious !<->2
Best Tortas in the valley . We had the torta Mexicana and fish tacos . Both are delicious . My favorite is the torta cubana . The pan dulce they sell is the best as well . You wo n't be disappointed .<->1
Hipster HangoutBut - they play fantastic music , display an awesome interior , and have great coffee . This coffee spot right off campus is definitely worth checking out and getting some work done !<->1
Great Chilaquiles and scones . Cool atmosphere . Definitely a recommend . Friendly staff and in Central Phoenix .<->1
This place used to be good . The food is below mediocre now ! The new owners changed way too much . The crab puffs are gross , the teriyaki sauce is bland . Overall quality is at a - 10 . Do n't bother going anymore .<->0
Very good . I get mine to go . Authentic Mexican . Love the quesadilla and burritos . Have told many friends about them and those that have tried all tell me thanks they really enjoyed !<->1
Delicious food and great looking restaurant . Servers were extremely attentive and friendly . Overall , great restaurant . Would definitely go again for a special occasion .<->1
They have a large menu and a great selection of gluten free options . The portion sizes are large . We will be back for sure . Great place ! The only downer was the flys buzzing around . We sat inside and they were annoying .<->1
Been here many times and it 's always a great experience , great food , great service and what an awesome environment ! Nice work Sam Fox !<->1
Very friendly interactive staff . The waiter explained the types of ovens and pizzas and that gave us some choices weight not otherwise have known .<->1
Just had a bison rib eye med rare might be the best I 've ever had .<->1
The food was so good the taste of it made me feel like I was on vacation . the owner is super friendly and nice really makes you feel important . Five stars he deserves it .<->1
I live for their baked pesto pasta with chicken . service is always amazing , prices reasonable and portions are huge !<->1
The tom kai gai is hands down the best soup I 've ever had . I do n't live close but I 'll drive all the way to Scottsdale just for this restaurant . Great service every time we come too !<->1
Mlife , first it was resort fee , now even self parking they charge a fee to park your own car . Hello your not the only casino in Las Vegas<->0
Best donuts in town . The place looks a bit out of the seventies and does n't take credit card , but it 's totally worth the detour<->1
Absolutely love this place , I believe the owner drives a Mustang which looks sick . I like buying the bbt that comes with the reusable water bottles<->1
Solid spot for quick ( relatively ) , healthy and local sourced food . Not gon na be fast food rates but you get a decent Amon too food for your $ .<->1
Bartenders were super friendly and helpful in ordering . I had a mango margarita , spicy queso , and 2 street tacos . So good ! ! !<->1
The chicken salad sandwich is my fav here . They have pretty yummy green tea as well . The service is fast for everything being freshly made . Love the setup , it is very open and clean .<->1
Really flavourful and cruncy katsu and karage ! Not to mention the customer service was great as well . Will definitely come back !<->1
I would not waste my time on this place . Very mediocre food and really just about like a seat in Taco Bell . Really not worth going here with lots of other good choices within a 5 minute drive<->0
Recently added breakfast to their menu ... items advestise on menu , they were out of it , offer no substitute . Food arrive undercooked , over cooked , tasteless and cold . Bad service ... 45 minute wait for food to arrive .<->0
This was the best buffet out of the 3 I visited using the Buffet of Buffets 24 hour pass ! PH Spice Market & Harrah ' s Flavors . Dinner is excellent and dessert is on point ! Great customer service !<->1
Went here with my dad for lunch and overall I gave it 4 stars .. service was excellent and friendly and food was good<->1
This place is great for the Friday Fish Fry . They also have an all you can eat special on Fridays . I also love their Margaretta 's . They are made from scratch .<->1
Solid shawarma spot ! These guys have great service and are generous with meat and toppings . Love the chicken , not sure if I 'm into the beef since it 's almost like gyro meat<->1
Was just ok but the service was fantastic ( Angel ) went out of her way to make our lunch great ... the food and an average server gets 3 stars ... , the food and Angel get 4<->1
Never disappointed . I love the falafel . I love chicken on the greens . I have never gotten a dish I did n't like here . Soups , salads , and entrée something for everyone .<->1
Great Food ! ! Everything I had was amazing . Plus the staff was super friendly and they really makes you feel comfortable . I highly recommend the mini donuts . Well worth the calories :-) . I ca n't wait to come back .<->1
Best Mediterranean in the area ! I could eat the falafel pita and fries daily . My friend had the beef shawarma plate and loved it ! Overall this place is fantastic ! I also love that they carry flavored Sanpellegrino and lemonades !<->1
Another overrated Italian food chain . Nothing great about the food except for the service .<->2
The freshest and best fish on the west side . Specialty rolls are amazing . If you do n't see what you like , let them know and they will create something on the fly . And keep an eye out for the sushi baby !<->1
I had the fried lobster tail couple weeks ago now they dnt hve it please get that bk on menu<->1
Wow we were craving Mexican pizza and they made it " Amazing " we will be coming back again and highly recommend , the food is good and prices are fare<->1
First time in my life i had a bad cup of coffee from a d and d . The service here is generally ok or poor . I will go to a different d and d .<->0
My family and friends have come several times to the Sahara location , and everyone loves it . The Gyro sandwich is the best I have ever had , and I have had them in Greece ! ! !<->1
it was mouth watering the first few times ... then ... it got boring . fast , cheap and good food for drunks is always a great option i guess . - 1 star for always running out of soup ! esp the broc and cheddar .<->1
Some of my friends have had not stellar experiences here , but I 've done the lunch buffet about five times and it 's always been amazing . I crave it . I think the price went up a buck lately but still worth it .<->1
Went here for team lunch . We ordered a premium combo for 4 . It 's good and fed 5 of us full .<->1
I thought this place was mediocre at best ... this is the first time that Yelp has steered us wrong ... not great ... clean and nice staff but sushi was disappointing .<->2
Awesome experience . Everything was spot on . Nicely season dishes and well composed . Great service . Thank you .<->1
Wonderful bakery , I had the spinach crescent yummy . The smell of fresh baked bread greets you at the door ! Amazing place .<->1
Excellent food . Love it here only problem is the booths are SO uncomfortable they sink in badly other than that no problem at all<->1
Best steak ever ! Great customer service ! Chef was on his game ! Desert was incredible<->1
Excellent breakfast ! I had the crab cakes bennidict , it was awesome ! Also , ask fir your hash browns extra crispy :-D<->1
I like there tacos only because it tastes better than taco bell ! nachos sucks , we tried other things and it was ok .<->2
Good BBQ . Not great , but good . I 'd go there more often if everything was just a little less expensive .<->2
hakim gives great customer service , he is so friendly and makes my day i always try to get in his line ! !<->1
Cheap prices and a great place to get fresh veggies . Place does get busy on the 1st and 2nd of the month given how cheap the place is so try to avoid those two days .<->1
Tasty selection of sandwiches served by personable , friendly folks that have great personalities and obviously care about their food and customers . Only thing that would have improved my meal was a pepper shaker to flavor up my sandwich .<->1
Family owned ! ! ! Never see that in a mall .. the food is delicious ! ! Highly recommended for the food and the wonderful service ! The girl who helped us , Delilah , was also very sweet as well .<->1
Good food and prices . Okay music , great space in the courtyard . Accomidating staff .<->1
Great Spaghetti and meatballs ... the marinara is delicious , not straight from the can like most places . The burgers are awesome go for the Mike Byrnes , it 's always a great choice !<->1
PMD is awesome . They have fantastic lunch specials , and their $ 5 pizza is much better than other places with the same deal . They do n't skimp on cheese or toppings . I ca n't get enough of it !<->1
Excellent service & the quality of the food is also amazing . The staff was very attentive and you can tell they 're happy to be at work . Definitely taking friends and family here for breakfast when they come to visit !<->1
Awesome Business . Went in looking for parts to make my own fermenting jars . Jeffrey taught me the difference between the 3 different types he sold . I left with the correct supplies & knowledge . Thank you<->1
We were really taken by surprise by this restaurant . We ordered the chicken shawarma plate with fatoush and baba ganoush . The food was authentic and the meat was seasoned so well . Try the freshly made fresh fruit juice . So refreshing !<->1
Great Lardy Sonoran Mexican food . Been coming here for years and plan on continuing to come for years . Hot sauce is nice and garlic cumin ish . Everything in the menu is solid .<->1
Fabulous bread and decent amount of meat on BIG sub . My medium is basically two lunches . Tasty pasta salad and no problem with big order for entire office .<->1
Mellow Mushroom is a great concept all around . Good pizza , great beer selection and plenty of TVs to watch the games . This place is always buys but the service has always been good .<->1
Decent food , friendly and prompt service . I 'm a little biased on the drinks because everything was free . But the service was plentiful<->1
Sushi rolls were very good . I would recommend the dynamite roll . Only had one guy helping during dinner rush . He hustled and did a good job .<->1
Great staff and awesome wings that are fully cooked ! I will drive across town to get the yummy lemon pepper ones . Family packs are a great deal and you can pre order online so you do n't have to wait .<->1
Good tasting donuts . Highly recommended . Price is very reasonable . $ 10 per dozen . Line gets long at times , but worth standing there .<->1
Way better than the Roberto 's across the street . Their portions are bigger and they do n't nickel and dime you like the Roberto 's franchise on Eastern . Great and fast service . Highly recommend !<->1
Got chicken pad Thai for takeout . Spiciness level 3 was my preference . Portions are massive ! Food is good . Service is good .<->1
Food was really bad ... I ca n't see how people love this place .. I brought 11 people to come try , it was our first time .. The server Shawn was good but said cook sucks .. just like the food ... never will go back ..<->0
They have a nice selection of cakes and other desserts . Price is moderate and the taste is good . I probably would n't sit down and enjoy cake / drink there , but a good place to pick up some items .<->1
Sign said that gas was $ 0.10 cheaper than what the pump price was so kinda felt a bait and switch but hey it 's just a gas station right ?<->0
The stars are for the staff , the food gets zero stars from me . Ordered the Black and Blue burger . The bun was so hard it was hard to chew and the meat was dry and over cooked .<->0
Reasonable priced . Better then alberts / pats food .. but not as good for the oxtail . Location is good<->1
Really good at 2 am after clubbing ! Kinda pricey as each slice ranges from $ 5 - 7 . There 's also always a line at 2 am but it moves at a decent speed . Overall , definitely would recommend after dancing the night away !<->1
Went there for birthday dinner with coworkers . All of us in town for biz . Excellent service & food . I ordered the scallops which were amazing ! Others had short ribs & halibut . I tried halibut - very juicy & flavorful .<->1
adorable place with lots of vegan options<->1
Super slow and the staff are not trained enough . Every time I order a drink I need to wait for fifteen minutes , insane<->0
Not very good food , General Tao is hard , no actual chicken ; just batter , but is the only option in the area if looking for Asian ( Canadian ) inspired food .<->0
Awesome pizza . Old fashioned pizza shop with charm . Great friendly service . Got a regular pizza it was huge like a Pizza Hut large .<->1
Loved it ! ! Excellent pastas and meatballs . Thin crust pizza . Sever Miguel was awesome ! !<->1
Solid italian restaurant . Somewhat pretentious but the service is spot on . Food is ok - not excellent but worth a try .<->2
the food is awesome , I like the ambience of the place too . I like their beef stew pot.their beverage cup is cool too<->1
Really fun atmosphere and a reasonably priced menu do n't skip on the fries ! Short staffed when we were there but all of them have awesome personalities ! !<->1
If your looking for fast food ramen / udon place this is it . The food was pretty bland and they push the tempura , but at $ 1.50 a piece average . No thanks .<->1
Went to try Breakfast Club for lunch . Great ambiance for downtown Phoenix . Ordered the Chicken Caesar and it came with sweet potato fries . Good food . Great setting but really slow on service .<->2
7th & Carson , still a gem in downtown Vegas . Trust me when I say go there for cozy wonderful hospitality and delicious food . Next time I go I will sample their cocktails so I can give areview .<->1
Expensive but they meet the 5 star rating for its location and service . Request for a window table during reservation for a good experience .<->1
Taste is average but they added 20 % + gratuity for lunch themselves ! Felt we were being robbed somehow when we got the bill .<->0
Their wings are AMAZING ! Had their riesling wine too . Great service . Will be here again !<->1
Great food at a great price ! ! We got the smokey , buffalo chicken , and first - time . Everything was outstanding but the first - time was our fav . They close at 2:00 pm so get there early .<->1
They have the best thai food in town . I live in Henderson and occasionally drive across town just to eat the food .<->1
Best breakfast in Pitt hands down . The omelette are super good . Must try if you visit pitt<->1
Absolutely nothing special about this place . We ordered 3 - 4 different things and not one thing had a taste . Extremely bland and plain . If you 're a bad cook you can just make this at home .<->0
I really wish they have a retail store in town . Double sea salt caramel is the best !<->1
AMAZING , I wish could stay longer in Arizona to try out all the food there . Idk why people are giving low reviews because of a busy wait time for seating .<->1
Amazing food , staff and decor ! Highly recommend you try many different dishes ! The patio is a nice feature ! They have a Live DJ on Thursday 's , which is cool !<->1
fun place to hang out for drink on friday and sat nights .<->2
We love Curry Garden ! Sobin always serves us , and he is fantastic . I would like to see the place be a little more updated , but the food and management is great !<->1
Really great sushi place . Spicy salmon sushi rolls are the bomb here . Also the Japanese curry beef with rice is amazing . Friendly and fast service .<->1
Awesome food . Very fresh pasta . Food was upscale . he tiramisu was to die for . The waitress was friendly and helpful .<->1
Great poutine , draft selection and meatballs ! A little pricey , but worth it .<->1
Situated where all the good japanese and korean restaurants are . A nice treat right after dinner Love the bbt here .<->1
For great Mediterranean food and some great hookah in a super chill hookah lounge there is no place better . If someone wants hookah or Greek food , I am going to always bring them here until I find someplace better .<->1
1st time here , it was pretty busy for a Thursday Night . Gold Wings were delicious and just how I asked for them extra crispy . Pizza was good also .. will definitely be coming back .<->1
Great food , great ambience , and great service ! We will definitely come back ! You are missing out if you do not come !<->1
Killer happy hour deals ! ! ! 1/2 off appetizers ! I 'm not a big drinker but they have some killer deals on drinks too ! The service was quick , table was clean and enjoyed a late lunch , early dinner ! :)<->1
Great food , nice service - open kitchen you can see what they are cooking . Ingredients are fresh and tasteful . Great drinks and wine selection as well . Ambience is nice can accommodate friends and couples . Truly loved it<->1
Placed an order and get a call when almost drive in said order was canceled because they ca n't make it . 1st time ever happened on my pick up , horrible waste of my time<->0
Really enjoy this place . Service was fast , their takeout options are just as good and inexpensive as dining in and the Sushi was fresh . Loved the quiet atmosphere .<->1
Got some wife pastries here ... they call them melon something - pretty decent . Mom also tried other baked goods and she approved . Very central in chinatown and opens early and closes pretty late !<->1
Love this place for breakfast . Pretty limited menu , but you come for the cozy atmosphere & friendly people . Dogs can hang outside . Not your place for fancy coffee .<->1
Good YESOVERRATED totally ... When the lineup in the summer is approx ummm 30 - 40 mins please ensure all selections are available when you finally make it up to order<->2
Descoberta super gostosa ! Pedi o sanduíche tradicional de carne defumada e não me arrependi :)<->1
Delicious Italian food , easy access since it 's in the Fashion Show Mall . I was introduced to this restaurant in Chicago and ever since we love to celebrate special occasions there .<->1
The worst pad Thai I have ever had ... Very salty and the pork was so tough it was inedible . I was extremely disappointed .<->0
Phenomenal . Been in Phoenix for the week and on the last day found this place . Great food and service .<->1
Ordered take out last night and it was surprisingly fresh and good ! The chicken tikka masala , aloo gobi and mushroom mattar all tasted authentic . The samosas and naan were excellent !<->1
The montecristo is the best and for a decent price . Would definitely recommend to family and friends .<->1
This was the best gluten freee I 've had and will be back whenever I visit Vegas !<->1
If you want a cold , rude and over priced food for very small portions experience this is the place :/ . Long time to serve customers no friendliness nothing . This place simply sucks .<->0
The ahi avocado salad is the best I just love the wasabi vinegertte it comes with so tasty . I personally do n't like ginger so I get it without . I can eat this salad every day :) love it so much<->1
Wife and me just love coming to this place and relax and enjoy the great food and cold beer and just have a good time .<->1
Texas BBQ House is the real deal ! Awesome food . Highly recommended .<->1
Good atmosphere . Bathroom smells like a sewer . Nice staff . Food was n't great . Fries had the taste of the old grease that 's been cooking everything . Burger , recommended by bartender , not great . Not even good . Pickles on the burger tasted weird<->0
This has to be the absolute best ramen restaurant in all of Montreal ! I 'm never disappointed ! The broth is absolutely amazing and the meat is always so tender and delicious . Everyone needs to try this place ! !<->1
A yummy Mexican Sunnyslope dive . The oatmeal horchata is tasty ! THE torta is really an experience !<->1
Excellent turkey reuben and fries . Real fresh turkey and crispy french fries .<->1
A little hard to find but great service and very filling food .<->1
Love coming here on my lunch hour for discounted items.meat selection is good , not a fan of the pizza they have , but still love going there .<->1
Great service . Great food . If you 're staying at the Boulders , this is a no brainier . The appetizers , entrees and desserts were all good . The server was on his A game for our party of 9 .<->1
This place is a joke without Danny at the bar . Clientelle are whiny and suck unless they are controlled . If she is nt there , no other barmaids can handle anything abd would prefer to just kick people out .<->0
I think I will stick with the frozen ones . The prices are overpriced and almost twice as much as the frozen ones that taste almost the same .<->0
We enjoyed real Thai food prepared by Thai lady cook and served by a Thai waitress . The dishes we ordered made me remember of having same taste during multiple visits to Thailand .<->1
I love this spot ! My personal faves are the cheesecake , apricot linzers , and stromboli . Yum !<->1
Great place to play darts . They have real darts and you can play for free . Lots of imported drafts and this place has a pretty low key and chill vibe .<->1
Food was so good I had lomo saltado and arroz com mariscos yummy and amazing people who work here they sang me happy birthday :)<->1
Rien a redire de cet endroit ! Service bon , rapide , nourriture excellente et ambiance plus que parfaite ! Un petit bijoux montréalais !<->1
Good coffee . Great food although it 's a small menu . Fun vibe and friendly staff . Never a bad experience here . Would recommend it everyone if you are downtown<->1
Hands down , the best pizza i have ever had . I have tried a sandwich once and it was very expensive and not worth the cost but the pizza omg is excellent .<->1
Some of the best French toast I have ever had ! The blueberry syrup and whipped cream made it even more perfect .<->1
My boyfriend and I came here for New Years Eve . They offered a special menu for the occasion at $ 99 / person and you were able to pick from several choices for each course . Everything was delicious ! ! The staff was pleasant .<->1
According to the employees on Sunday the 25th . They are closing for good tomorrow .<->2
Best breakfast in Vegas ! ! ! Friendly , fast service . Excellent food ! ! Hash browns were perfect . I wish we would have found this sooner into our trip .<->1
We came in for a quick bite and the restaurant was very busy . but the appetizers we had this day were just ok . We will return to find what we missed the first time !<->2
Great place to shop and chill . We like eating here then shopping since you should n't shop hungry , kids meals are really good and we can try a different wine or beer each time .<->1
Great response to the issue I had with the Happy Hour - ca n't wait to try again ! Every person who 's been there raves about it .<->1
Awesome dining experience ! I love the atmosphere , electric blue lights and modern decor . The staff was enthusiastic , I could hear the staff sing happy birthday every 5 minutes it was delightful . I will be coming more often .<->1
Starters were lame , but the steaks were bomb , the drinks were strong and the service was freakin great . If you can afford it the porterhouse is the way to go all day<->1
Went there for dinner place was empty and the pork looked as if it was in soupy water very questionable .. left without eating ..<->0
I totally love every single thing about this place , coffee , cocktails , pastry , and dinner ! the atmosphere and the place are cozy , hipster and contemporaneous .<->1
Not worth the price . They make you wait longer and short you on the number of wings .<->0
Location schön gemacht , ein Kuriosum , das zu Las Vegas passt . Preise i m Shop unglaublich überteuert , Bedienung eine absolute Katastrophe , unfreundlich , unkonzentriert , falsche Essen geliefert . Fazit : Da hat Las Vegas doch andere Highlights ...<->0
Great service great food . And the bacon queso fries are my new addiction .<->1
Amanda took care of me and I had an incredible time ! Excellent drinks with wonderful ambiance , food , and service ! Thank you !<->1
Just ok . Periodically gets very low health dept ratings . I got an upset stomach ( polite word for diarrhea ) twice in a row after going there .<->0
Love love love Fresh Chef Kitchen ! Terrific , engaged staff with solid menu choices . Excellent for lunch or dinner . Go enjoy !<->1
Best chicken paprika sh around . Just like grammas ... this is an awesome diner . A true amherst local shop . If you are traveling through stop . Great food and great people ! ! !<->1
Hyped . Chicken pita is chicken kebabs inside a pita . That just makes it not a pita wrap . Goat cheese is excellent with salad . Food not very inspiring . Cost effective not pricy .<->2
Always have a great time here . Just a small , easy going wine bar with nice people . Oh , and food trucks . Yes , wine a food trucks . Not so Portlandia , more Mesalandia vibe .<->1
Amazing food , we have tried lots of Japanese steak houses around the valley and this one is our favorite by far . Great food great service .<->1
The food was wonderful and the prices were on the low end of high . We had great service and will definitely be back .<->1
Excellent lunch specials for excellent food ! Can be a little on the sweet side with some of its dishes ( at least for my taste ) , but all around excellent Vietnamese and Thai food at affordable prices !<->1
Lisa was a pleasure to work with . She did a great job for the 2nd year in a row catering breakfast for nearly 30 guests . Her food is always fresh and delicious .<->1
Mmmmm authentic stuff . Sweet service . Legit . Was n't feeling the Mexican today :) got some meat pies and Turkish coffee and enjoyed the Bosnian tunes ! ! !<->1
I 'm not into anything that 's brag worthy spicy ... but this place has that . This is pretty darn authentic Thai . I try to go at lunch time so I do n't have to listen to the band .<->1
It 's our favorite ramen in town :) Very flavorful , tastes like traditional Japanese style . Chashu fried rice is delicious , too ! Yum !<->1
Lived right around the corner from this cute fantastic and delicious place . Highly recommend . Staff is friendly , store is usually always clean and the flavors and selection are always good .<->1
Regular burger joint at average prices for a sit down restaurant . $ 20 for two burgers with fries and sodas . The food was well prepared , but the guy who took our order ... I dunno . Service was kind of lame .<->2
Food is great ! Zander 's Bar is clean and friendly ! ! Bartender Darci is precious ! ! ! Band is less than mediocre ! ! !<->1
Mediocre meat quality , overpriced , service was slow and salad bar was blah . Overall do n't recommend and wo n't return<->0
Typical pub food nothing special . It taste good and our server was very friendly . The tables are wayyyyy to close together . Great selection of beer !<->2

They ruined my taste for my previous favorite philly shop . GOOD stuff . Fry sauce and all .<->1
Solid 1 out of 5 . 1.5 hour wait and one person gets missed all together , no apology and manager nowhere to be found . Got taken for $ 140 ride ! ! !<->0
This is such a great place , wonderful service , plenty of TV , good slection of menu . Enjoy watching and fun !<->1
Cool little divvy spot with an excellent menu and a great beer selection ! The people were great as well . They could use more seating but you ca n't complain about everything ! Definitely worth a trip .<->1
The service is very friendly . All the Mexi standards are on the menu and prepared fresh . The plongueur needs to sneak some steal wool into the kitchen , though . Those pots and stove need some love .<->1
Cookie cookieEXCELLENTVERY friendly and attentive staff . 30 years for a reason ... Yorkville is in transition , lots of construction and vacancies .<->1
So glad to stumble upon this place ! It 's refreshing to get great food , quickly that I actually WANT to eat . So often we eat fast just because we have to :) Reminds me of the " Chipolte " of Italian !<->1
Noodles were lumped together . Chicken and pork were over cooked . There wereOnly three tiny shrimp in the dish and the brown sauce was as sweet as pancake syrup . Very dissappointed in this place . Wo n't return due to very Bad food .<->0
Delish food ... Delish dogs and their Fries are amazing ... Fun relaxed atmosphere . Very enjoyable ... Outstanding customer service and very friendly and welcoming employees .<->1
Tandul is super awesome . Food and staff are great . Have been here once for dinner and once for lunch buffet . Both were delicious . Buffet had a nice variety .<->1
Staff is always pleasant and food is delicious ! ! Love that the express lunch is served with kettle chips and French onion dip .. Nice touch ! ! Great selection of beers on draft as well ! !<->1
Excellent food for a premium price . Service is always great . Can be a bit noisy on busy nights . If you wish to eat at the bar , you can . Great for appetizers and drinks .<->1
Its a friendly Mom and Pops greasy spoon that serves value . They have old fashion combos that remind me of my days during high school and university . George 's Deli & BBQ is bot bad .<->1
What an amazing experience ! Adrienne , Eric and Havier took great care of us , treated us like royalty :) Food is delicious ... drinks are well - made . Definitely one of my favorite Vegas restaurants .<->1
Best Jerky I 've ever had . Triple Threat is amazing . It 's gourmet jerky . They have gluten free and sugar free options as well . Way better than Jack Links . And healthier .<->1
VERY small , parking sucks , good food . Nice variety of salsas . * Do n't come on your lunch hour unless you are an executive lunch .<->2
This is one of the best pizza place downtown ! Especially the Fileti D . O . C which has some real good Motzerella Cheese !<->1
Be prepared to choose between nutella crepes , cookie butter french toast and spam scramble !<->1
Food was excellent but kind of costly for the portion size , servers were slow and not very friendly . Probably would n't go here again<->2
Great restaurant ! Me and my wife had our babies gender reveal here with about 30 friends and family . Everyone loved the food . The owner and staff is very friendly .<->1
Really a nice place . Food is good , staff is attentive and the pricing is very fair . Chicken Parmesan was fantastic .<->1
Great pizza . Loved it . 70 choices . I 'm a Montrealer . Ca n't believe I never heard of this amazing place . Will definitely be going back .<->1
Food was very good as well as the service . It was difficult to put up with the flies , ugh . Still we will try it again and hope for a no fly zone for flies next time .<->1
" I love this place so much . They even have lomi oio and poi . My favorite . The owners are so cool . Poke is Ono . just like back home on the islands . Mahalos so much for making this place here . Aloha "<->1
If I was sober I 'd have more to say ... but I have memories of delicious smells , tastes , and textures . Seriously though ... I was wasted ... I mean , it was amazing .<->1
Good noodles with pork . Traditional Chinese food is Devine . Hard to find the place though . It 's located at the second floor of the building<->1
This place is real close to our house . Love , love , love the cold coffee options . Great food with unusual and delicious menu items ! We will be back again for sure . :)<->1
Niko 's has the best coffee in Pittsburgh ! I miss their old location in Robinson , but they are worth the trip downtown . I buy their fresh ground coffee by the pound on a regular basis .<->1
Still packed after two weeks , good sign . Roasted almond latte was delicious . Overall service was quick and efficient . Will go back in a couple months and see if the line is shorter .<->1
Had some chicken and rice and yuca via DoorDash on a business trip to Charlotte . Loved the chicken though it could have been a bit more crispy . The rice was great . Would recommend .<->1
This place makes 1 thing . Why is the line always so slow . Food is good but there 's no reason this place should be this slow<->0
everything about this place is great . staff is top notch . i hear they have regular celebrity sightings as well . last time i was there i saw Mike Panza . That was pretty excitingAlso , Coheed + Nachos = Perfect<->1
Fresh , delicious treats at a great price . This is a small Filipino bakery next to Babystacks , and despite eating breakfast first , we still brought pastries home . They 're just that good ! The cream cheese croissant rolls are especially amazing .<->1
Cafe Solo is what a neighborhood coffee shop should be : fun , good , pleasant atmosphere , relax , comfortable seating . Why do people still go to Starbucks ? Really enjoyed it , will go back .<->1
We went last night . The owner is lovely , friendly . Excellent service and great Thai food ! Very pleasantly surprised .<->1
I came here for a surprise bday dinner with my husband and it was delicious . The plates are beautiful and the ambiance is trendy . Loved the middle eastern vibe as well .<->1
Good bbq turkey , good service a good fun view of the aquarium . Not busy , no waiting . A little pricey but good portions<->2
Food is rather disappointing - the soup was far to salty , the papaya salad without any dressing or other ingredients ! ? I returned it . Would not go there again .<->0
We 've taken our Dog to this Uncle Bears many many times and the service is always 5 star , the food is always consistent and the atmosphere is great - would definitely recommend as a cool Ahwatukee hangout !<->1
This is one of my favorite places for breakfast . The service is always friendly and attentive . Food comes out amazingly quick . I highly recommend their Bacon Benedict , and a stack of some of the best pancakes you 'll ever have .<->1
Looooooove the burritos with potatoes ! Get a Mexican coke ! My girlfriend always gets the Chicharrones . Definitely her favorite thing ! !<->1
Store was recently remodeled and a sushi bar and much larger natural foods section ... LOVE IT ! Store is always super clean and the employees are very helpful and kind .<->1
My step - mother told me that Cost Plus carries lots of flavors of syrup for coffees . While that is true , they did n't have the Gingerbread syrup I was looking for , so # fail .<->0
Great food , great service ! Definitely , worth the visit ! Cozy place to relax and enjoy a cup of joe !<->1
Best Thai delivery place near me ! Everything I 've gotten from them has been delicious<->1
One of the best artisans bakery in Montreal . We always get our bread there or at their other location on Mont - Royal ave<->1
Amazing , authentic , El Salvadorean pupusas and tamales . Our family LOVES when I bring these home !<->1
Went for Valentine 's Day . Place was jam packed . They handled it all with no glitches . Portabello Fries are quite possibly the best thing I have ever eaten .<->1
I ordered the chipotle bowl for the first time . It was surprisingly really good . A little spicy , but great sauce .<->1
Great lunch specials ! And the customer service was excellent ! Definitely be back to try all their specials .<->1
Best pies around ! ! ! Great little shop . Lots of varieties . Looking forward to trying their pot pie & quiche . Very reasonably priced . We had the apple cranberry & the chocolate peanut butter cream . I 'll be back ... soon<->1
awesome service , personnel , products , prices and location ! ! Love the feeling of being able to find the healthy stuff that I need in one place ! , and we can eat there too ! ! So awesome ! !<->1
I ordered a pizza yesterday and it was the best I have had since I came to the states !<->1
Sunday Brunch was good ... not great , but good . The food was tasty and they seem to use high quality ingredients , but there was just something missing to push it over the top and give it 5 stars .<->1
Average , not the best or worst . A little salty for my taste .<->2
Incrtedible food & presentation , fantastic service , amazing ambiance ... I loved every second of it ! Definitely worth the price !<->1
Excellent service ! Keith was a fantastic server ! We had a slight issue with my daughters steak and he fixed it and got Jake the manager involved right away . We would certainly eat here again , fantastic all around !<->1
I decided to to try the lunch speacial , horrible asked for water gave us bottle water , did n't even ask for it . My friend had a small strand of hair on his food inside the chicken<->0
Decent burger , bun was a bit crusty . Fries are ok , not bad for what seems to be a home style burger . Great customer service .<->2
Had a really nice time here . Did n't get a chance to do the tour but the service here is great . The staff is super friendly . The beer is great and the pretzels are delicious .<->1
This place is the best and most creative sushi I have ever eaten . It is worth the trip off of the strip . A MUST DO if you are in Vegas !<->1
My favorite sushi and the price are very good ! I do every week order delivery and sometime I eat there also . my favorite are : la langue de dragon and the spicy mango<->1
Save your time and money and skip eating here . A limited menu , with small portions of bland food . However , the outside area is nice for drinks , with fire pits & comfortable lounges .<->0
Great service and great food . Really enjoyed the ribs , Mac and cheese , and burgers . Short ribs were fork tender and they even had grated horseradish available . And we got in without reservations !<->1
Coffee too sweet . Prices too high for the crappy coffee . Their pastry " eewww " it was dried ! Do I need to keep going ? I think I should stop . Never comeback here never ! The staff ? So so ...<->0
First Watch is amazing . When we first walked in we loved . The decor , the vibe , everything was great . We ordered the elevated egg sandwich which was so good and the breakfast tacos were also delicious . We will definitely be back .<->1
Love this place first class always reasonably price great quality live bands in the bar also excellent .<->1
Doughboys has THE best pizza around . Their angry rooster pizza is to die for , and their breadsticks are unbelievable . At lunch they will make slices any way you want , I love that .<->1
Amazing steak . I shared the 40 oz tomahawk , medium rare with truffle butter . Perfectly cooked ! The sides were as good and at times better than the steak . The mac and cheese was outstanding .<->1
Wow these cupcakes were amazing ! ! The frosting was picture - perfect . I tried Vanilla Salted Caramel and Pumpkin and both were so good ! The cake on both were super dense and moist . Vanilla Salted Caramel definitely was the best of the two !<->1
Tom Ka is loaded with flavor and everything you will eat , unlike other places where some items are too chewy or hard to be edible . Very nice and polite service too . Clean , spacious restaurant . 5 stars :)<->1
Do n't hesitate to go check out this place . Definitely get a cheeseburger and poutine just to complete the meal !<->1
One of the worst places I 've have ever eaten . Chicken was like rubber and the dumplings were cold . Anyone who likes this place has never had good food<->0
We landed in Vegas at 9:00 AM in the morning , dropped our bags off at the hotel , and went straight to Hash House A Go Go ! Freaking delicious !<->1
Stopped in with a small group recently . I had the snapper which I found to quite good . Also heard good comments about the pizza . Service was fast and friendly and the atmosphere pleasant . Would return .<->1
2.0 / 5 - tikka masala : great sauce , dry chicken ( end of lunch buffet ) 3.0 / 5 - curry chickenGood service , brought out fresh naan near the end of lunch .<->1
This is my favorite little hole - in - the - wall restaurant . Intimate and clean , with the best Pad Thai in Vegas . Great place for lunch , and it 's family owned and operated . Highly recommended !<->1
It 's good fast food . Chicken minis are great for breakfast but need more then 4 to feel full .<->2
Taco Bell hell yeah just do n't go in the bathroom . order your stuff and go<->2
Great restaurant with authentic Georgian cuisine . The food is amazing and the menu is quite rich . Unobtrusive yet attentive service . You have to try the khachapuri and the eggplant rolls with walnuts !<->1
Monster Sicilian pizza and 40 wings every time . so good !<->1
Legit mariscos spot I 've found since moving back from LA . And LA does n't mess around with their mariscos . A little pricey but what seafood spot is n't ?<->1
This place was perfect . Went in a group of 36 each meal was spot on . Only thing was for the desserts were not as good . My kids asked if they could go there again . And we will .<->1
OMG ... this was the best Indian Food I have ever had . Came in with no expectations , and ordered Veggie Samosas ... amazing ! Then chicken dish was off the hook . Service was really good too . Felt like I found a great restaurant to return too . Thx Origin !<->1
Wonderful place . They gave a donation to our fundraiser . Great owners and delicious pretzels .<->1
I ordered a tofu stir fry . It 's pretty quick if you 're looking for take out . The serving was big , and the prices were good for everything . I would n't mind going there and eating inside either . Definitely check it out .<->1
Ambiance is awesome ! Loud music and a nice crowd ; however the food is OK , and so is the service .<->2
Very disappointing - this is a great building and a great location however the food just plain sucks . The drinks are extremely expensive as well ... service is below par .<->0
Very nice place with great food and service . The food wash fresh and the ice cream was amazing .<->1
Great cheese steak . The sandwich was big and full of meat . The bread was cooked perfect . The staff was very nice and helpful .<->1
We love this place . Consist good food and fantastic service Better service than more formal dining . And a great garden salad with delicious homemade goddess dressing .<->1
Great vibes , loved the spritzin water on the porch . Only stopped for a drink but enjoyed the park and atmosphere<->1
I LOVE this Thai place . Best Thai in town . Easy fast delivery and I actually look forward to ordering it every time I see my friend . I always order the Thai with chicken not spicy . Excellent ! ! !<->1
This a great place for lunch or dinner . The sandwiches are always pleaders and the salads are fresh and plentiful .<->1
I guess big grocery stores do nt care for customer service ... :-( just asking raincheck for babywipes and pinesol because its out of stock . And they do nt like to issue .<->0
La pizza è buonissima ingredienti di qualità siamo rimasti contentissimi sia io che mia moglie . Continuate così<->1
I can not believe how slow this drive thru is . Wow . They really need to get their act together . Seriously .<->0
They have all u can eat brunch on Sundays Now , and it is so so good , with lots of variety ! ! Just trust me and Get there , your belly will be happy<->1
Food is very tasty with lots of options on the menu . The hot pots look very popular . The 3 dead fish in the fish tank and overalls upkeep and cleanliness will make me think about going back .<->0
Blt needs a little work , mayo . Bacon a bit more cooked then how they serve it . Cream cheese bagel is lacking the yummy creamy cheese part lolNice family run business<->0
Really not an Italian restaurant . Had a sampling of appetizers , liked the baba ganush , falafel was pretty good , everything else pretty mediocre .<->2
This is a great bar that recently opened up in the Kensington Market neighbourhood . The owner and the staff are really friendly . They 've got many different cocktails and beers available . Nice patio in the back as well .<->1
First time here and I do n't know why I waited so long . The happy hour menu is awesome and it 's 3 pm to close every day ! I 'll be coming back here often .<->1
This place were always one of our favorite spots for pho , but today was extra good ! I just had to post a 5 star review . Super satisfied !<->1
Extremely disorganized . Confusing to say the least . I want my money back ! Thankfully we had breakfast so we payed the least compared to lunch . Never coming back . Worst breakfast buffet experience .<->0
Hit or miss sometimes I get great customer service and my beer 's are constantly being refilled sometimes it is a battle trying to get a refill ! 3 star 's is A OK it does n't mean its horrible !<->2
So delicious ! ! Hamid is very kind and sweet and the donairs are made with love ! He stayed open just so we can make it after we gave him a call ! !<->1
Love this little place . Awesome frozen ravioli and rigatoni . The fresh sliced pasta sheets make the best linguine and lasagna . And the owner who is always there is so helpful and nice .<->1
Cafe 100 has the best crab cake meal ! The greens and mashed potatoes that go with this meal are wonderful ! It 's such a hidden gem !<->1
Amazingly good & delishhhh food ! ! My new breakfast / lunch favorito ! Caribbean inspired food with Jamaican product sauce ! Unbeatable ! ! ! Luv the ambiance ! ! Very modern & minimalist decor . Clean & great staff ! ! ! You 'll see me there often for shooooo !<->1
Le café est super bon ! Le seul bémol c'est qu'il a vraiment pas beaucoup de place . Mais bon . J'ai adoré mon après midi là !<->2
Omg . So good and so inexpensive . I would definitely suggest having the Kim chi ramen .. slightly spicy ( like it should be ) and so delicious . 2 for 1 thai tea with Boba too !<->1
We got to sit and watch football while listening to music and eating great food . We both got the combo for $ 10.99 . It included 3 ribs , a leg , thigh , side , and drink ! So good !<->1
We stopped for breakfast and were impressed with the the variety , freshness and speedy preparation . Very friendly people and a most pleasant surprise . A great unpretentious breakfast or lunch spot .<->1
I ordered the Chicken BBQ sandwich ... was not that great . The chicken meat lacked any flavor . And the bread of the sandwich was extremely mushy . Plus , no sides and no kid options ! ! Just FYI ...<->0
On of the best authentic Italian pizza in town , if your in downtown it is a must to visit even if your in Montreal worth the drive . If your looking for real Italian pizza and not American<->1
The Chinese food there is amazing ! Had the house special fried rice and island mix mixed vegetables ... Yum ! It 's what keeps me going back ! The decor could use some work ... Really crappy , hence the 3 star ratingGood service though !<->2
Very nice and friendly staffs , yummy foods with decent prices . I will definitely come back here .<->1
Amazing burgers and sweet potato tater tots . They are big , too . My husband said his turkey burger was the best he has ever had . We will be back the next time we get to Phoenix !<->1
An update to a previous review I thought was necessary . Food and service were both excellent . Well deserved 4 stars !<->1
Left my thoughts at the " Tip " ; so sorry ! I would n't eat there again . The 2 best Indian resturant I have ever had are in Kansas City in Rosa Zone & in Daytona Beach by the beach on Main Street .<->0
The Manager contacted me personally to offer us another meal and his apologies which we really appreciated . The manager formerly ran the Tucson location which was a great so hopefully he can turn this location around .<->2
Awesome food . I had the Euro burger , hubby had the Blue bgr . Both were awesome . Make sure to try the Parmesan fries , best ever fries I have tried .<->1
Used to be good ... but has gone down hill they just need to maintain better quality Indian food even when it 's a buffet . It 's becoming less authentic making it Mexican / Indian !<->0
Chai tea is pure , fresh and tasty , highly recommend ! i usually order icee chai but hot is just as good .<->1
Not the best sushi ... but good . I do enjoy going there for drinks and the crowd . Great looking peeps , good music , good drinks , friendly service , good location , good sushi .. I m a happy girl ;)<->2
No Star for this ! Rude Cashier ! No manners . that little long blond hair always talking shits ! not professional ! i love the food but will mever com back if the staff are still here .<->0
George is my favorite ! (= He has wonderful customer service skills , he knows how to make amazing drinks , and builds great relationships with his guests . Love the food also .<->1
Our server was Chow . l loved his service if I could give him 10 stars I would I will be coming back . His manager was Ana . Thank you both wonderful job .<->1
The food is good , the owner is awesome . If you get delivery , the delivery driver is really nice too !<->1
Best BBQ and the sides are pretty damn good too ! Mac and cheese is a must as a side .<->1
I 've been here about five times now . Every single visit , I 've had fish tacos which have been DIVINE every time . Best fish tacos I 've had in my life . Add hot sauce for some pizazz !<->1
SPiN was a lot of fun ! They also having amazing side snacks such as the smores ( a must try ! ) , homemade cinnamon donuts and bacon candy !<->1
Love their breakfast ! Servers on Saturday mornings are excellent . It 's a casual , relaxed place . You must try the omelets .<->1
The fried okra was awsome the cod sandwich was very large and good . I really enjoy it for lunch and had enough for alitte dinner .<->1
10 bucks really for a x small burrito the meat was burnt if i did n't have a 30 min lunch i would of went back ill not be returning<->0
Only tried this once ... so far ! It was really very good and they delivered ! The samosas are delish and the lamb vindaloo was flavorful and spicy . The naan and basmati rice were great also ... I 'll be trying it again ... soon<->1
Awesome BBQ place with excellent and friendly service . Top choice for Boulder City , and on the way to Hoover Dam . Would definitely go back ;-)<->1
Ordered : Jasmine milk tea - less sweet with bobaI could really taste the " tea " flavor in the drink . The boba was made perfectly . Service was very nice and helpful . Would definitely recommend this place .<->1
Food and customer service is always on point ! Some of my favorite plates include the garlic shrimp , tuna carpaccio , and shrimp butter rice .<->1
Nice atmosphere and recommend their fried chicken and smoked chicken along with some smaller dishes such as okra with bacon jam .<->1
Um .. YUM ! Every sauce was awesome , best potatoes ever , how do I make those ? ? I 'm going home to try ! The staff was friendly , our food came quickly and I wish I lived closer so I could try more items !<->1
Excellent summer happy hour . Food was good , service was a little on the slow side , so that could be improved . The burgers were great<->1
Food is always good and server always very pleasant and friendly , without being intrusive . Love their philly cheesesteak sandwich .<->1
Had takeout and not in press . Ordered chicken parmesan and eggplant Parmesan . Eggplant was good but the pasta was over cooked and no sauce . Same goes for the chicken parmesan and over priced . Sorry but I will not be back<->0
Du hamburger comme on aime !<->2
Best fish in Scottsdale . Great atmosphere friendly staff . Always good . Fantastic fish tacos . Great portions . Like Hawaii in Scottsdale<->1
I love this place ! Best birria i found when I came to Phoenix from LA , if you 're in the area it 's a MUST and if you 're not in the area it 's well worth the drive .<->1
The old location at the Rivera was my favorite Indian resturant in vegas . I was blown away by there new location and flavors<->1
Moving across the street and putting in a drive - through window was the best decision this Starbucks location ever made . I love how convenient it is to get a great cup of coffee now .<->1
Have been coming to kaizen for 3 years and love it . Favorite sushi restaurant in las vegas<->1
Awesome experience every time we go . I 'm usually ordering the bulgogi , pork belly and bbq brisket . What 's cool about this place is that we can cook it ourselves at the table and it 's a great deal .<->1
Such a charming and quaint interior with very modest costs for food . I will be back , often .<->1
Very good food , fast service and the restaurant was very nice . Will definitely come back<->1
Can you say Thrifty pistachio ice cream on a sugar waffle cone ? Yes ! I believe they have about 20 or so different flavors , italian sodas , coffee , snack items , smoothies , Hawaiian shaved ice , and of course water .<->1
Pretty good food . We had a problem with a dish that we did n't care for and even though we called out they made us another one . They even threw on fresh fries which was unexpected . Great customer service ! Thanks .<->1
The staff was friendly , we were seated right away . The atmosphere was perfect for a date night . The drinks were well mixed and the sushi was great . I will definitely be returning .<->1
Main menu is pricey and limited . We had appetizers instead . Short ribs were great as were sliders . Beef carpaccio was horrible . Maybe just different from what we were expecting . Service was excellent .<->2
Food was very good . Wait staff was excellent . Atmosphere was nice . Food was moderately priced . I will certainly come back . It was a very enjoyable evening .<->1
Les meilleurs bagels de Montréal ! ! Il y a toujours beaucoup de monde mais le service est très rapide et ça vaut vraiment la peine de patienter .<->1
On a essayé une deuxième fois ce restaurant , on a trouvé qu'il est cher par rapport à ce qu'on a mangé La quantité est là mais le goût est moyen<->2
Love the entire place . All the wait staff is so nice . The food is always good , especially the AZ veggie burger and a great Moscow mule ! Its a whiskey bar . And tvs galore . Regular and love it<->1
We did the happy hour thing . Had the lettuce wrap and some fish wrap . Meh . Mediocre at best .<->0
Always come here for lunch or brunch , never disappointed by the food . Cheap and good quality food , pancakes are a staple !<->1
Ordered 2 breakfast raps it took 23 min to get my order and they were cold . Horrible service today .<->0
5 stars , this place is as good as it gets ! I drive 30 minutes to come here ! Best donuts I 've had in my life !<->1
The food is great , the atmosphere is even better . They mixed up my order once and they fixed it and gave us the goof to take home . I am a huge fan of the beef .<->1
Been there couple times since it 's the closest place that serve all day breakfast . The food is blah and the cooking is n't that great . Seems like the food either is over - cooked , undercooked , or lacks flavour . The service is mediocre .<->2
Always excellent customer service from Mo and his crew . He is incredibly polite and a wonderful manager to deal with if anything ever goes wrong at their site .<->1
Simply superb , classic cuisine . Braised peek belly , lettuce and fried green tomato sandwich was amazing .<->1
My favourite place to get ramen ! This place is often busy during peak times . My favourite is the pork spicy garlic . I would recommend adding and egg and corn . Original karage is great for an appetizer .<->1
Really like texas road house very good food and the rolls are the best with the honey butter the food is just that good everu time i go to texas road house .<->1
The best place in Nevada to eat ... The food taste really great . The service is really good . I recommend this place 100 % . Viva Venezuela .<->1
Good food , nice staff and fast service . Salad in the shawarma is never fresh but the meat is tasty . Opt for salad - free shawarmas and you 're good<->1
Grilled cheese with tomato soup - 5 stars , not having real plates and serving dressing in plastic cups - 1 star , service - 5 star , very accommodating , so overall averages to around 4 .<->1
Great people great food , great prices . For Ohio this place is really good . Coming from CA , and AZ my family is spoiled . However this place is great !<->1
I 'm not much for nightlife , but if I were to go out with workers or friends , this would be my choice . More professional crowd , no UFC on the tv , comfortable chairs , great music , and a gigantic airplane !<->1
Clean and comfortable with a large selection of food and drink , staff are sincere and committed to customer satisfaction . I 'm very happy it 's my local shop .<->1
We had the best food and service ever . We are in for a wedding . Otherwise I 'd be here every single day . If you get down here , this is a must go to !<->1
Good breakfast prices . The breakfast platter is a good deal . Would be nice if they recycled . The salads add up quick so watch what you add .<->1
This place is outstanding . The Guinness stew and fish and chips is the Brest I have ever had . The server is from Dublin and makes the day . Best Irish pub in Vegas . .<->1
Chips and Salsa was acceptable . Service was good . But I came for the tacos and they sucked . The hunt continues to find badass tacos in Madison<->0
The polish dog was ok . My hubs ordered the BBQ beef sandwich and every other bite was filled with meat fat . Nothing more disgusting than eating fat imho . Tip to mgmt ... trim the fat off the meat for sandwiches . Gross .<->0
After going back several times looks like they are over their growing pains and are now going full force and are that wonderful " chick " we all love<->1
this place is awesome ! I ordered the vegan super veggie delight with soy sausage and it was incredible ! I will definitely be going back<->1
Food was absolutely amazing , great wine selection , and stellar service . Next time I 'm in Madison , I 'll be back !<->1
It was a great atmosphere . Friendly staff . I enjoyed my Tempe roll . Great menu . The only thing I did n't agree with was the price on some of the food items and the booze . I would come here again .<->1
I had the AYCE . Very good . Fish was fresh . The wait staff was very attentive . I would return .<->1
A terrific new place in Waxhaw . We went there & were surprised to find such a great tasting burger and a really nice food selection in a pub . We have been a few times & have not been disappointed .<->1
Cranberry margarita is delicious . Butternut squash tortelli is fabulous ! Ambiance is nice , comfortable and lively , but a touch loud . Portions are perfectly sized . Very satisfying !<->1
The buffet serves very bland and undesirable food . If I spend $ 86 for two people to eat the bottom line is that I should enjoy the food and hopefully the experience . Neither happened here .<->0
did nt know what to expect going in but damnnn is this place delicious . i got the spicy coconut curry which was the best of what i tried . i def recommend this place<->1
nice clean shop.great tasting alkaline water.great price too . $ 1.25 gallon . Alma is very nice and helpful.good selection of hard to find Philippino grocery<->1
Gross ! It was just gross ! The chicken , the fried cheese wanton disgusting ! Gave one star because I had to !<->0
Great Pizza . Great Service . We ' ve been here a few times since it opened . And always look forward to going . We have never had a bad experience . Each time has been great . Our waiter Dave was perfect , always on the ball .<->1
Never a negative word with this establishment ! ! ! Delicious food professional waitstaff and beverage offerings nicely chosen to enhance what ever direction your tastebuds might lead .<->1
This is a really great place . Best Greek salad town . Always great food and nice guys . Should have a higher rating .<->1
This is the best Thai food ever :) amazing service and great atmosphere . Definitely will be coming here again<->1
Ribs were awesome . Great smoke flavor . Brisket was grisly and dry . 5/5 for ribs , 1/5 for Brisket .<->2

I love Mexican . I love local . I love OHio City Burrito . Friendly . Fast . Perfect Portions . I agree . Blows the chains out of the water ! Veggie BurritoVeggie BowlChips n GuacLoves me some OCB ! ( and the skeleton out front )<->1
We just eat at Bobby ' s burger place in Vegas and encountered a little critter ... too bad , not a clean place<->0
The place is ok , food is good but the ambiance is a bit too dark to my taste . The brunch start to late on Saturday ( only at 11 am ) .<->2
Walkin in the coffee shop authenticates the true hipster inside of you<->1
I love this place so much ! The interior is unique and old school and funky with fairly dim lighting . You should make a reservation cuz this place is very popular . The food was outstanding and free wine with your meal !<->1
Saturday Night , it was your topical 30 minutes Wait ... Yahoo bam we sat out on the patio overlooking the lake . Bam the pizza arrived its out of this world . This is my place .<->1
Fast Friendly Service ... one of my favorite Mexican places . Food is awesome , I recommend the Taco Loco , Burrito Norteña or the Chorizo Pollo<->1
This Mexican marisco restaurant is a true gem . The food is amazing and service is great . Prices are justified by the amazingly delicious food .<->1
Great food but lackluster service . I 've been here twice and both times ( 2 different female servers ) they were not busy because we went at an odd time but the service was very slow .<->2
Had a great experience here with my husband and two little kids . The burgers were outstanding and the cocktails were perfection . Even the kid 's meals were delish ! Perfect little local joint .<->1
I had their signature iced tea with freshly made matcha tapioca . They did n't ask me for the sugar level and I 've forgotten to request for less ; the tea ended up " too sweet " . Tapioca were soggy and sticky .<->0
This place is awesome for a quick and nice lunch ! Just go there and the people are soooo nice ! ! !<->1
The food here is great . Small , casual , and seems to be the best kept secret for lunch . Moderate prices , not a cheap lunch , but very fresh and tasty . Try the pepito and the fried provolone ... YUM ! ! !<->1
Yummy , authentic . " Treated like a queen " ;) I had the spiciest hummus version . Lots of food . The drinks are small .<->1
Excellent combination of sushi and burritos . Tastes very delicious . Definitely will come back again .<->1
Great food , large selection on the vast menu . Prices were affordable and a great value . Very nice atmosphere . Waiter was so friendly and made sure we all are satisfied . I 'll go back .<->1
Great authentic pizza - crust just right and love having fresh garlic available to add as you like . Nice selection of craft beers as well and the cheesecake was delicious . Good atmosphere too . First of many visits for us .<->1
The juice can get pretty pricey , but I still frequent this place 2 - 3 times a week . The service is on point and the wonderful ladies here will always help you find just what you 're looking for . I 'm obsessed .<->1
Delightful little cafe with an abundance of teas . Stopped in for an iced tea in the afternoon and had an iced oolong that looked more like a beer than a tea , poured with a nice head . It was perfectly delightful .<->1
Stopped at this quaint little place and it was amazing . Food and service are second to none . Very reasonably price .<->1
We tried Jose 's experience - which is a sampling of 11 different tapas plus a dessert . It was a fantastic experience . Food and service were excellent . We even had the cook deliver some meals .<->1
Delicious ! We eat here every time we 're in LV . Try the fresh springs rolls and the Pad Thai Woon sen . It 's location is an unassuming strip center west of the Strip , but it 's a very nice inside .<->1
At the beginning had to wait awhile for the waiter after complain with a manager everything went excellent food is good atmosphere is really nice after all everything went good thanks for the good time<->1
Great place for cheap bread . I get the sandwich thins ... for a DOLLAR . Pretty much every thing is a dollar . Bagels , English Muffins , any of the breads and pastry . The staff is extremely helpful . Love it here .<->1
Great atmosphere . Great service location is awesome . Food is very tasty and their Nacho Libre are delicious<->1
I had a chance to have a buffalo chicken salad . It was so wonderful . I love eating at this place . The service is always great . Ca n't wait to go back .<->1
Best of the best , tradition ( personified ) of the classic family Italian Deli . Keep up the good work .<->1
Food was good and matches perfectly with beer ! Will I come back ? Not really . But definitely worth visiting once in awhile . For me , this place was way too crowded and noise level was so high :'(<->2
Great spot in Oakville for Fish and Chips ! Very pricey though . highly recommend paying the extra to get the better quality fish and fries .<->1
Horrible food restroom smell like shit and employees were rude not asking if I need help this place sucks<->0
At first I was skeptical because it seemed like the food would n't turn out good . I got it to - go and when I got home , I loved it . I loved the customization . Its like Chipotle but Benihana style .<->1
Love this place . I work at a salon close by and we order at least once a week . The service is lovely and the food is great ! Greek salad with chicken and hummus is wonderful . Go try it out !<->1
I love vietnamise food , and the friendly staf of this place . Thank you Greg , Anne , Martha , Bao , tina , Tony and Jenny ...<->1
Food is great and fresh . The churros are a rip boiiii lemme tell you<->1
Went there last night to bring home a seafood bucket ... Had crab legs , Mussels and Shrimp ... Crab legs were of the smaller variety but really very tasty as were the Mussels and Shrimp ... Good neighborhood place to go !<->1
This place does n't seem like it would have such fresh delicious crab but its does ! My husband and I ca n't stop eating there and the servers are nice . I like the casual atmosphere as well . Blue crab is the best !<->1
Love love love . Been here a few times , every time is perfect . The yogurt is so fluffy / light . Need to figure out how to cook meals served at this restaurant . So flavourful .<->1
A great place ! and amazing food ! Sorry about today and thank you for your delivery !<->1
A great veggie omelet with squash , sun dried tomatoes . asparagus so fresh it must have been grown locally . Endless coffee cup and superb service . I rate this restaurant a ten and I will be back .<->1
The soup and sandwiches are awesome here , great and friendly service . Cookies are tasty too . If you come at noon there might be a small wait but totally worth it . It ' s a must try !<->1
Absolutely love the food ! Great variety of diverse flavored burgers . Truffle fries are great . Milkshakes ... yum ! Priced well . Always my go to place for burgers .<->1
Drug test your employees . They are all incompetent other than the one guy making salad .<->0
Took a half hour for two omelettes , came out cold and the cheese was hard around my omelette . Yes I said around my omelette because they did n't put anything inside of it . My colleagues omelette also was cold and hard .<->0
Great Chinese Food ! Highly recommend . My favorite in the Parma area .<->1
The food was good but while ordering it seemed that every other person was listening . And kept messing up my order . I still give it five stars because they pulled through and I had a great meal<->1
Amazing thalis . My favourite Indian joint on Jean - Talon ever since Pushap down the street changed management a few years ago .<->1
My husband and I love this place - he was looking for a specific beer we could only find in San Diego and they had it ! Small but great selection and service !<->1
I simply love this place . It is like a home away from home for me . The barristas are super friendly and a pleasure to be around . Love it !<->1
24/7 makes this to place to go after a crazy night out in Las Vegas . Highly recommended but there are better options during regular hours .<->1
Went here several times with my boyfriend ... slowest service EVER ! Food was terrible . Owner is nasty ! If you 're not one of the regulars they could n't care less . Do n't waste your time ! ! !<->0
Leaves something to be desired . The customer service was excellent , unfortunately that is the only thing that was .<->0
The food was good , i had a pound of buffalo wings , decent portion and the service was prompt . Although the place can be quite boisterous at times . Beware of the bogans that come around in the summer time<->2
Very unhygienic place . As soon as we opened the menu , a cockroach ran down the page . Not going back here .<->0
What a wonderful place with an even better startup story . The breakfast we had was amazing . The toast is THICK and buttery . The chive potatoes with fried onions are crispy and delicious . Check this place out when in Vegas .<->1
After disappointing start at Kaya Sushi , we returned to Yama Sushi , the quality is top notch , the servers are nice . Service is quick , and the atmosphere is clean . I love it . Will return ! ! !<->1
My go to restaurant . I always bring people here because the food is dependably fantastic , the service is wonderful and professional , and the desserts are killer .<->1

The lunch is perfect portions here . Got the 3 course lunch and it was so good . Ravioli with vodka sauce was perfect ! !<->1
Lobster on a stick ! ? ! ? ! Seriously all of my dreams have officially come true . Great chunk of lobster grilled to perfection with butter on a stick . I can not say anything more other than you should go try one immediately .<->1
So far my favorite sushi place ! Everyone is so friendly and service is always on point ! Their sushi is delicious I definitely recommend this place !<->1
Dropped off my prescription they said they were busy I gave him a whole day to fill it it 's still not filled 45 minutes to an hour wait time in line just to find out it was n't filled<->0
This place was AWESOME ! ! ! We usually go to tofu hut and this place was a great change of pace ! :) the harami miso was my absolute favorite . The duck was excellent too . Definitely go during happy hour !<->1
Definitely would recommend the poke ... AweSomE . Great service & best place to get a bite if you 're waiting for the Fremont lights .<->1
Terrible service was so so seemed like they were under new management . Everyone I talked in there was unhappy . We had plenty of time to talk because service was non existent .<->0
Avg breakfast with decent pricing . Good for a quick bite . Waitress was slow for liking . Had to ask her for everything : more coffee , jam , a pen to sign my bill ...<->0
Just called to find out their hours but evidently the phone number listed is a cell phone and the woman has moved out of town .. Guess the business is out of business ..<->0
Great variety of food , tastes good and good portions ! Would recommend trying this place out .<->1
Good noodles but even better dessert - go to Milk Bar .<->1
Warning : this review is done without even testing their food . I have literally waited in line for my food for one hour and 22 minutes and still have n't received yet . Efficiency is it real problem here .<->0
Had a great breakfast here ! Super friendly staff , extensive buffet and great a la carte menu . We had a breakfast burrito and granola yogurt pancakes ... yum ! Nice morning atmosphere to start your day !<->1
Really juicy chicken very flavorful . Lots of shoestring fries and great sauces . Also had the natural which was also delicious . Cane sugar sodas . Very good meal !<->1
Great place to go to get pastriesFabulous serviceI love going here every time I 'm in Montreal<->1
They are closed now . They forgot to tell their employees that they were closing so when people showed up for their shifts the following day , they showed up to a locked door . Now that s Classy<->0
Pretty good lunch menu the lamb curry is really good quite and cozy atmosphere . Reasonable prices<->1
Came here from out of town . Amazing food and even better customer service . I would highly recommend .<->1
This place is super good . Their burgers , fries and green chili burritos are amazing . They actually call you each time they are serving green chili burritos . They only serve green chili burritos on special occasions<->1
Wonderful . So pleased to have this type of restaurant north of the city . You ca n't go wrong with any menu selections here . Go have wine eat and enjoy .<->1
We have been coming here for years . Favorite bagel sandwiches . Super friendly and nice owners . Highly recommend . Need to also try them for breakfast soon .<->1
We have ordered several times from Brothers . Pizza is good and the 18 " pizza feeds our family with some left over . Great dinner before our boys play football at CCV . Recommended for all .<->1
Food is on the over seasoned side . Recommendation would be to go for the bento box and choose the amount of sauce yourself<->2
Came here around 6p on Friday night and just about had the place to ourselves ! We thought is was some of the best service and sushi we 've had ! The volcano roll is the best version yet ! !<->1
This is one of my favorite restaurants . The food is always great and the service is awesome , I also like playing the board games they have available , all around a great experience here<->1
Very cute , classy place to have a great pizza with a glass of wine , organic salads and panini<->1
Moving here from Oregon I give this place 5 stars becouse the seafood is great here ! The staff is amazing and very down to earth !<->1
Good fresh food - medina locals best little secret for a great meal . Salad bar is great ... nice and cozy !<->1
Awful service and management , complete clusterfuck , if you asked for the worst service ever they could n't even do that . Apparently it 's a " tappas " place because we basically never got our appetizers and 2 out of the 3 meals<->0
ConsExpensive by 33 % , untrained & rude workers , and no water cups available . You have to buy water bottle . ProsBig dining area . Slot machines very near .<->0
Although this place is small when compared to other restaurant it seats everyone comfortably . The lightings and ambience is very nice . Sushi starters are delicious and there was only one chicken entree on the menu .<->2
My husband 's from Jersey and he said this is the closest you are going to get to New York pizza in Vegas . Friendly staff , hot food made right then for you , not over - seasoned . Prices are pretty good too .<->1
They really do amazing burgers here . Classic , flavorful beef with an amazing house sauce ... Definitely a step above Peters Drive In !<->1
Graveyard special . Hash browns , steak and eggs all really good . Was at south point and their deal was 4.99 . This was 5.99 and was a lot better quality of steak . Just have to try .<->1
This is the best Nepali restaurant you will find in Pittsburgh . Pork sekuwa is the best . Best customer service .<->1
We love coming here ! Way better than Boiling crab ! You get what you pay for ! The customer service is awesome . We are never leave disappointed . We try to come every month . We love it here .<->1
Sushi Fever has been going downhill for some time . Service is slow and staff is not particularly pleasant . I ordered the Bento lunchbox which is a ton of food for $ 8.95 and it was ok , 3 out of 5 stars .<->2
They have delicious food and great service ! This is definitely one of my favorite places to visit for pho .<->1
This is a nifty little place to grab a quick lunch or quick bite in the afternoon . We really enjoy their chicken dishes . Prices are good too .<->1

Really great food with my favorite korean flavors . Ordered delivery and was very impressed with the seamless and efficient service . Would highly recommend this restaurant !<->1
the store is wonderful , the people who work there are great , the service desk dept . phone line is the worst . do nt try to call , their phone system does not work .<->0
Went in for a quick slice was surprised at how good it was and the garlic knot was amazing too as well as the sauce , definitely looking forward to trying some of their dinner items<->1
The best ice cream and boba in Las Vegas ! Better than other boba stores around the area . Thai tea slush with boba highly recommended ! Try those vegan ice creams too like blueberry acai the best !<->1
Yum ! Great service , great atmosphere . The food is like a healthier take of Greek food . Pretty tasty and less guilt !<->1
Awesome place , great pizza . Perfect for date night . They even have some craft beers to try . We had the Thai pizza , it is spectacular .<->1
Amazing service ! Both Ted and Dan were the funniest bartenders we 've ever encountered ! Definitely loved how they bounced off each other ! Amazing suggestions and great beer ! Ca n't wait to come again !<->1
Easily my favorite for Indian food . That egg biryani is out of this world . The service is top tier and for the love of all that is holy ... get the chicken 65 ! ! !<->1
Awesome bartenders , awesome beer selection . The food is very good but a bit pricey . Try the shrimp salad or the sliders .<->1
Great food . Awesome ambience . And very friendly and accommodating staff . The tapas menu was a delight . Perfect for an intimate night sharing with friends . The the food and wine flow .<->1
Tasteless and overpriced ! View is great but with a hefty price to pay for the disappointing food plus parking cost ! Service was super slow and overall a bad experience<->0
Went here for happy hour as others had suggested . We feasted . Everything we got was beyond delicious . Make sure you get the seaweed salad , it 's a must !<->1
No more brunch ! We asked why and " Things went another way " whatever that means . So we ordered coffee to be polite and then had to sit and watch the barista and waitress make out behind the bar . Gross .<->0
Love coming here for Breakfast in the center of Lakewood . Portions are huge and very filling . Prices are extremely reasonable , but beware - CASH ONLY and be prepared to wait for a table on weekend mornings .<->1
Great food , probably the best I 've had in Las Vegas . I would of given 5 starts if not for the wait , it 's a small restaurant and with the awesome food they have the wait was long to be seated .<->1
Fantastic ! The food , service & restaurant itself ! Our server John was the best , he knew the dishes inside and out . Cocktails were perfect !<->1

I went there with BF after drinking for the snacks on weekend . They were good . My favourite was the fried chickens .<->1
The service is amazing . The soups are made with heart and soul ! Especially the pho , which is always hot and very fresh . The place is very clean and the staff incredibly friendly and helpful .<->1
Welcoming Atmosphere . Better value for lunch , but still good.an array of choices , ranging from Thanksgiving dinner to a taste of Italy . Overrated Ham hocks great dessert choicescome hungry though<->1
Great atmosphere , cute decor , like the history , but food is average . My steak burrito was small and not a lot of flavor or sauce to give it some . My daughter and wife had very average quesadillas .<->2
Great service and selection . Have used Munchees several times for party supplies .<->1
We absolutely loved the food ! We had the big eye pizza which was delicious . We also had the yellow tail jalapeñoand the albacore . One of the best sashimi we ever had !<->1
Their donuts are super fresh and the staff is very friendly . The place is kept clean . I would come back when I am visiting Vegas again .<->1
Stopped in for a couple of drinks . Could have gotten 5 stars , but bar tender had a moustache , and great tits .<->1
Excellent meal , all from the specials . Try the ravioli with osso bucco sauce .<->1
The best Brooklyn Style Pizza in Phoenix . They even have Jamaica Beef Patties . You wo n't be disappointed .<->1
Butter chicken roti always worth it here . Good mango lassi . But kind of pricy ... 2 butter chicken roti + 2 mango lassi = $ 35 .<->1
One of my favorite place to chill . Everybody is really friendly . Like the music and very good food too .<->1
Stopped in tonight with my boys after school . The young man behind the counter was very friendly & the froyo was good ! We 'll be back for sure :-)<->1
Employee rage ! ! ! Staff throwing dishes when cleaning up customers plates . Lady with baby asked him to stop because he was scaring her baby . He did n't , so she cancelled her order she was waiting for .<->0
Very nice place with an immersive atmosphere . Delicious tapas and cocktails . Good service . Recommanded bar .<->1
I love this place . I ate here back in ' 08 and have been coming back ever since . Their tofu is the best in the city , bar none .<->1
Always enjoy TJ 's ... Excellent people here . Always cheerful and helpful . And .. great bag packers !<->1
The fries were mushy . Ewww . Just ewww . The restaurant was dirty and smelled funny , and the other patrons were kind of creepy . Felt bad for the woman working the till given how the other customers were treating her .<->0
A great restaurant with great service . The place is strictly okay , but food was delicious . I met the chef and he was very passionate about what he does ! Strong recommendation for folks in Montreal and looking for great Indian food !<->1
Excellent , wings are way better than burgh , s and half the price everyone it told to try this place loved it give it a try<->1
Went here with friends a few days ago , had a great time watching dolphins while you eat . The food was great and our waitress was better . I ca nt understand the negative reviews everything was done very well . HIGHLY recommended !<->1
The greenpointer and the Swartz are fantastic - - unique and delicious . BYOB is always nice , too .<->1
A great locally owned business that 's worth stopping in ! ! It 's a good , healthy , fresh option for everyone , and the service is always mediocrely fast !<->1
Love that they are keeping Leenas going . Oakland misses it . Got a gyro platter and it was great . Two pitas , gyro and fries mixed , salad , and tahini . Fantastic .<->2
Great spot , excellent food . Nothing fancy . Recommend the veggie burger with fries , they also make a mean fish and chips . Bar is solid too .<->1
Very good presentation and the food was amazing ! ! ! Sushi is to die for ! ! ! Manger was very friendly .<->1
The wings suck do n't bother ordering them ... I have a felling the whole menu is rough . The beer comes on icy cold mugs which is awesome . If they would improve the quality of the food it would be perfect .<->0
Hunter Hudson and I went to Don Rubens for lunch today ! ! ! Great serviceGreat foodWe've been going there for about 6 years now .<->1

My fiancé and I love this hidden gem off Johnston road . We especially love the zattar app , the tabbouleh , the mixed platter and even the gyros .<->1
Place used to be.much better . We had a good waitress , but she had her work cut out for her .<->0
Excellent food ! We got the chicken tiki masala and lamb boti Masala . Service was amazing too . The owner is really hospitable . Portions are small but the amount of flavor in every bite makes up for it .<->1
My husband loves the frog legs and the seafood is a huge draw , but the BBQ is Outstanding ! ! ! Wish they had it at the MESA location . We will be back for that killer brisket !<->1
Went here for lunch the other day . The girl at the front was very friendly . I got 1 Slice of Reg Pepeperoni Pizza and it was delicious . Great spot for a cheap lunch !<->1

Very cool restaurant my husband and I really liked the decor especially the leather couches we had the strawberry and Brie the fried chicken and ribs really good food I will be going back to try something else<->1

My favorite Chinese place around . Service is always excellent and so is the food .<->1
Had the guacamole & monster burgers with fat fries and onion rings 2 sodas $ 20 . The food was delicious . No complaints . Left satisfied . new burger spot for us .<->1

Great place to get some great pie ! ! ! 3.99 for 2 slices of cheese and a drink ! ! ! ! Right amount of sauce and the cheese is perfect . Great find on a lazy afternoon .<->1
Delicious food . Not a big place but fresh ingredients and they serve a quality brunch . I really like the whole grain pancakes and the grits . The bacon maple jam adds a really awesome flavor to the grits<->1
Best restaraunt in the world , Every time I eat here I am so pleased with the Med - gold wings , pizza , and pesto pasta / big rig . Love the people and service is always great !<->1
Pick from the front bar or the back . Some of the best cheese curds around . Burger was top notch as well . Stop on in for see great food and good beers .<->1
2nd visit , better . But it was not busy , no one in line and only a few customers already inside . Fries are still overpriced - but burger ( normal ) was good , no complaints . Still nothing special so far .<->0
I moved here six years ago from N . CA.Been looking for a creative pizza chef . Found her at Biga . Sourdough crust like I had in San Francisco . Awesome<->1
Excellent customer service and very relaxed atmosphere . Its a pretty good value with large portion sizes . Will be back for more .<->1
We have only been here 3 times , but every time its the best hot dog I 've ever had . Price is fair and the quality is consistent . Give it a try , you wo nt regret it unless you hate delicious food .<->1
Delishhhhhh everything taste so good . And the staff is awesome ! There arepas are to dye for and their sweet plantians with cinnamon and brown sugar<->1
Get the turkey pastrami ! ! It 's a little messy but you will thank me ! It has coleslaw which I do n't like but loved it on this sandwich . It comes on warm soft pretzel bread and is just amazing ! !<->1
Great Friday Night Fish & Chips . Five big pieces ! ! ! Very nice Sports Bar in Chandler 85248 .<->1

Excellent food but the service really makes this place top notch . Also very kid friendly Which was a bit of a surprise ;) . Stick to the steaks as they are the best i have tried .<->1
This review is based purely on the ice cream . We had the cinnamon crunch and the flutter butter . Both so good , must try ! !<->1
Excellent endroit calme pour prendre un café , manger un petit morceau ou dessert et travailler . Super sympathique ! Le thé à la poire caramel est excellent !<->1
Awesome food ! Highly recommended I 've had a few of there sandwiches and I can say I 've never been disappointed always satisfied and there zucchini fries are bomb and the banana fosters bits are delicious .<->1
Cute little diner ! Small but amazing menu ! Unlimited refills on hot and iced coffee ! Best iced coffee I have had in a while !<->1
I always get the chicken tikka masala and it 's always delicious . The staff is pleasant and I have n't had a bad experience . The price is a bit steep , but it 's worth it for the occasional dinner splurge .<->1
Food here is great . I never ate in but also took take out and thought the food was amazing . They prepared everything quickly . I have no compliants here<->1
very busy and loud , tables are a little cramped . Food was pretty good , not outstanding , service was very attentive and good .<->2
Garbage . The whole menu is changed . The food is bland . The prices are higher . The cookie is raw . I used to love the tomato soup . This stuff tastes like its from a can .<->0
My girlfriend and I had a blast while eating here , food was good , beer was good and shots and a spanking were fun too .<->1
Amazing Waffles ! Follow them on Instagram and Twitter to find out where they are at . Totally worth ANY drive !<->1
The wait time here really sucks . I almost waited here for an hour for getting in and having my food on table . So be prepared .<->0
I Love fries ! ! ! I was excited to try this place and everything was awesome . Large portions and very filling and so delicious . Service was great also .<->1
Wow ! I got two chicken tacos and they were pretty awesome . Highly recommend this place ! I think the homemade tortillas is my favorite part of it .<->1
Only complaint is I was unable to tip them on CC cause it 's " company policy " bit to accept tips . The sweetest guys :)<->1
J'adore leur beigne caramel à fleur de sel ..<->1
The location on Eastway has sub par customer service and the security guard is always weird acting and staring you down . I feel like it 's too much .<->0
This is a restaurant I wish I could keep Secret ! VERY GOOD food ! Small , quant and a di - lish neighborhood dining establishment . Always take out of towers here ! A +<->1
Friendly service and A - mazing pizza ! Ingredients fresh and bursting with flavor . We tried the Capricciosa pizza and was very happy with out choice . Authentic Italian flavors in Peoria . Highly recommend coming in for lunch or dinner . Perfect date night location .<->1
Huge sandwiches , good , ice cold beer . Perfect for drinking between classes .<->1
This is the place for Dim Sum . We come as a family and we all leave happy after a good meal .<->1
The private party room is cool and great for a party with friends !<->1
Very good , The service was the only reason it was 4 instead of 5 . Now it was n't horrible but average . The bar mixed a descent drink . But the pomaganite in the guac is great .<->1
A perfect place to stop during an afternoon of shopping in Kensington . Always busy . Decor is mediocre but the salsa and guacamole are the best ! The staff is friendly and the margaritas are so yummy !<->1
Always delicious ... you select the perfect heat ... do n't forget the steamed pork buns ! ! !<->1
My first time and the sushi is actually pretty good ! I will be back ! I wish there was one of these here in Mesa<->1
The sushi is tasty and they make a nice miso soup . Happy hour has some good deals and a fun comfortable atmosphere .<->1
The food is wonderful and I feel good eating it . It is also fast and affordable ! I 've had them heat food for me to enjoy immediately and also carried out food straight from the cooler to serve at home .<->1
The food was really great and fresh ! We ordered a few appetizers and sushi to try some different things and everything was delicious .<->1
Love this place . Great food and atmosphere . Their iced coffee and biscuits and gravy are to die for . Yum !<->1
Very friendly staff . Always saying hi and willing to help . Best grocery store to go to to find almost all my grocery needs quick and easy .<->1
Fun place to eat when your here on vacation or are in tourist mode .<->1
Very good pizza with flavor and nicely done crust . Sslad was a nice addition for all . Definitely go there again<->1
Finally tried the Oreo pancakes . It would not be my first choice of breakfast type food ( maybe for my son ) . I will stick to classic breakfast and unlimited coffee ! Yum<->1
The broth was good . The noodles were okay . The meat was pathetic and nothing like the pictures . Not rushing back anytime soon .<->2
Love this place . A bit crowded when eating in and often have to wait for a table but food is delicious and fresh . Take out is just as good . A very cheap and cheerful experience all around .<->1
Walk in , take a big sniff and you know it 's right ! All is delicious , reasonably priced and open late .<->1
Delicious chicken you can never go wrong with this location that 's why I love eating here when I 'm out of New York the food is fresh and the staff always has a smile<->1
great food ! was there when they opened and two years later its still a wonderful stopping point coming off the lake .<->1
The . Best . Waffles . You . Will . Ever . Eat . It was like eating sugary air . I just wish the order came with more than two . ProTip : Get there before 10:30 a . m . or your screwed .<->1
Heard of this place from many people , finally stopped by for brunch with a coworker . No disappointments at all except that I had to return to work .<->1
Excellent service and food . This place is one of the best Izakaya restaurants we ate at .<->1
It 's good for breakfast though the rest of the menu stinks . And it 's quite pricey . I would not recommend this place for food .<->0
Definitely the best macarons I 've has in Toronto ! Ca n't wait to go back and try some more flavours<->1
This place was a riot for this first time bingo - er . If you 're with friends check out their room in the back specifically for chatters !<->1
The breakfast burritos and other breakfast options are very good . The service was friendly and the interior area was very clean . Overall it 's a good spot to grab a quick breakfast or lunch .<->1
I was hungry and now I 'm not ... YumLoved the Hawaiian menuI had the BBQ Mix Combo ... Super Good the beef short ribsMy kid had the Manapau she love it then eat all my fries :-)<->1
We visited this place today great food and good portions . We had Chicken Shawarma and Chicken platter and both were really good .<->1
There is a reason this location barely stays open . This was supposed to be a medium burger , not raw . They consistently raise prices and the quality keeps getting worse .<->0
Very Japanese style food . Ramen is good and the fish burger is good too . Worth a visit !<->1
Expensive but amazing food . Could not eat it all . Good value for the money . Server was okay but not very attentive . Portions were huge . Loved the flavors . We both had burgers .<->1
We sat outside . Such a great patio ! ! Drinks are amazing . Table - side guac is a must have . I would n't order the ceviche again , I 've had better elsewhere .<->1
Absolutely love this place . Everything on the menu is very , very good . Best shawarma I 've found in Cleveland .<->1
I 'm very concerned about the food safety with this place , I have seen some very questionable things go on here . It 's also always un godly cold in here .<->0
Just wanted to update that I 've tried the pot pie again and really like it . It 's so fresh , I love the crust and it hits the spot .<->1
Amazing food and service . We had the steak and lobster . Amazing ! Even the green beans were awesome !<->1
Edith the best of the best . Great personality and good sense of humor . She knows her stuff . If you car is dirty I definitely recommend this place .<->1

Nasty shrimp tacos today ! We must have gotten the rejects ! Very slow service.music is horrendous ! ! It 's going to be a very long while before we eat here ! What a waste ...<->0
Wonderful pizza ! Great gluten free crust . Will come back for sure ! ! Megan our sever was awesome as well !<->1
Great place for an old fashion burger . There was no waiting time and the service is fast .<->1
Excellent lunch , pork belly braised in a sweet sauce on rice with green onion , served with a VERY fresh green salad in a Yusu ( citrus ) dressing . Very nice wine list and byob with no corkage<->1
This was my first time getting five guys . Free peanuts won my heart ! They also gave me extra mayo when i asked them and did n't make a big deal about it . Impressive that they are generous on their condiments .<->1
It is a little pricey , but love this place ! Very good pastries , cakes , etc . It is a grocery store , but it has its nice ambiance .<->1
best chinese food in the area . closest thing to new york chinese food . ( i 'm from ny ) . delivery time is fast too . good job chopstixx<->1
This is my new favorite place to get a gyro ! Good price for the size you 're getting ! And here I thought it was a vegetarian place lol<->1
I had the Zinis Rice Special for lunch . It was good amount of food . Very full after . The restaurant is clean , and service is great . However , it 's a bit pricy .<->1
Ridiculously slow ... Lost over 25 minutes waiting in their drive through with only seven cars in front of me . Lost another five minutes when we got to the window .<->0
Love this place . This is the hidden gem in Gilbert . Good wine , excellent cheese tray , and the best creme broulee ever had . Sometimes we even eat the entree<->1
This was our first time in a stand up comedy show and we had a blast ! Definitely recommended .<->1
Great staff , great food and the best bubble tea in the Queen city !<->1
BOMB ! Medium Trifecta is spicy enough ... snow crab , sausage & potato ... delish ! Only thing better than the food was the helpful & friendly staff<->1
I really , really love this place GMO - free power food . Their salad bar is AMAZING ! ! I 've also had the spicy beet burger . OMG - yum ! :) ) Thank you Go Vegan ! ! !<->1
Went here for brunch . My cappuccino was 1 part milk and 1 part weak espresso with almost no foam . The food was OK . Service was also OK . The decor was nice , but unfortunately , it 's not a place I would recommend .<->0
I loved the bacon and maple syrup poutine !<->2
Love love love this place . Deffinelty will be willing to stop by anytime nice staff and great food .<->1
Chipotle is the BEST healthy fast food ! This location is nice with a large patio with easy parking .<->1
Basic food . I honestly do n't really like buffets in Las Vegas because the food is just not that great . But my husband wanted to come and we were really hungry .<->0
Classic diner atmosphere . Definitely would recommend trying the big dig . Very good burger . Got the curly fries to go with it and wo n't be getting those again . They were to hard and unappetizing . Will definitely go back though .<->1
You want authentic Filipino food , this is the place . Delicious food , and the price is right .<->1
This is hands down the best Chinese food in the valley . A true hidden gem . Fantastic food , great portions .<->1
Great taste ! Totally recommended . To be completely honest with you guys , the only thing I did n't like was that the person who attended me did n't know enough English to understand what I wanted to order .<->1
Nice surprise within brickworks . Nice variety of items , staff was attentive . Nice signage and presentation . I started 3 sentence with NICE .<->1
So much yum ! I love Mediterranean food , and this place is definitely on my A list . The prices are very fair , and the portions are well suited for my burning hunger and muscular thighs . Protein ! !<->1
Fast fabulous service and delicious food . Very filling . Kids loved the quesadillas , tacos , and chips . Homemade salsa chunky and fresh . My salad was so big I could n't finish it . Delicious . ( They do n't take Discover but it was worth it )<->1
The food is great , but they have the worst customer service of any restaurant I have ever been to . My advice , take the food to go .<->0
Meh ! Been to a million high end steak houses this one was boring and the waiter was a little lost . Food was tasty as expected . Nothing exceptional going on here at all .<->0
Great service ! Lots of beer choices and lower prices than in the store usually . Thanks ! !<->1
Love this place . Great food , reasonable prices , and the staff is always so friendly . Would highly recommend for sushi :)<->1
My roommate introduced me to this great place , it is a simple pizza shop with great food ! Even though it 's a pizza shop definitely try the cheesesteak it 's awesome . Also , there sausage is amazing as well !<->1
Yup , it is now official . This place is permanently closed . Good riddance . Rumor from ex staff is that it will be re = op ened as a Japanese Restaurant .<->0
Best Mexican food around ! Never had a problem with service . Servers are sweet and efficient . Nice and clean place . Love it ! ! !<->1
The California roll sushi is outstanding ! Come for lunch or dinner and bring your friends . RA is a fun place for a drink and sushi . I came for my birthday and had a fabulous time !<->1
Love this place it 's the best food that 's just like chicago ! So far we tried the gyro beef and pizza all amazing<->1
Absolutely amazing and vegan friendly place . We took two salads ( Mediterranean and white beans salad ) , chobra soup , dolma and ayran for drinks . Food is delicious and the service is great !<->1
Have to live a place where they sacrifice floor space for a water feature . I appreciate the commitment to ambiance , but it made my lunch mate go to the bathroom every 15 minutes !<->1
Expensive , but groceries are fresh and really the 3 stars is for the 24 hour service . If they were cheaper , they 'd get four stars .<->2
Have always had great service and good food and drinks at this location and it 's not overly Smokey<->1
Ok so we go here all the time now and it 's as consistent and good as Gandhi 's / Mother India . Fantastic stuff and they 've ironed out all the kinks .<->1
A must have is the Bombay Chicken . A little disappointed with the Pakoras .<->1
Best bagels I have ever had ! Made fresh and oh the smell :) I always get mine to go , and if I buy too many I pop em in the freezer to have later .<->1
Their chicken salad with the blueberry vinaigrette is EVERYTHING ! ! ! Very healthy and easy to log on MyFitnessPal for those tracking their calories and macros .<->1
Great traditional paella as well as some creative house paellas . Fantastic Spanish tapas as well as Ceviche , beef Tartare , and some other international appetizers . The service and ambiance were excellent . Pricey but well worth the experience<->1
Love the chicken and the fried okra . They are on . It 's grub hub and order up which is awesome !<->1
$ 5.99 Steak and Eggs Special . Daily 11 pm to 11am . Big portion . Juicy steak . Daym good eggs . ( http://www.yelp.com/biz_photos/c0ZerP3dvw3x2IWXzNKDyQ?select=S5JSMUwaviEo6MQZJVL8bA ) Do n't go anywhere else for the Steak and Eggs special . ( Read my next review )<->1
The service was slow , the server knew nothing of the wines on the menu and knew nothing of proper wine service . Boo .<->0
yummy ! the hostess has an amazing spirit . the good was great ! the mimosa flight was the perfect compliment to the meal . ca n't wait to go again !<->1
Cheese ragoons are top notch , even better than the crab ragoons . Recommend the beef lo mein & shrimp fried rice . Best Asian food in Deforest !<->1
The food was delicious , hot , and timely . Our waiter was in a rather good mood , which made our visit more interesting , and very helpful .<->1
I 've been eating at El Tizon for years . It 's the best carne asada in Las Vegas . Many have tried but everyone has failed . Till someone lets me taste better . El Tizon # 2 is really # 1 .<->1
Great menu in a lovely location on the Trilogy golf course . Even in the summer the outdoor patio with misters was very comfortable . Awesome wait staff !<->1
We had the first one on the menu added Mac and cheese with waffle fries as base it was amazing ! Cheesy crunchy will come back want to try the bbq dish next time !<->1
The crispy duck was excellent . Nearly half a duck for the price too ! Good size servings for the price , quick . They made an excellent attempt to provide service in French . Will definitely return here again .<->1
This is the best starbucks in Scottsdale . They are always super friendly and my drink is always perfect . Keep up the good work .<->1
I am liking this place more and more . The food is really good , drinks are inventive and service is great . Definitely worth a visit !<->1
This place is a well - run and clean Starbucks . It 's not the biggest Starbucks by any stretch but it is usually brisk business and you can normally find a seat . Customer service is good and the people are very friendly .<->1
Super Crackin ... Lots of fun . Great vibes , beautiful woman . Vegas atmosphere at its finest<->1
The best place on campus if you want to eat healthy , fresh , and delicious . Such a shame it 's so small - I wish there was more seating .<->1
Fettucine marre a monte , was pretty good ! well balanced proportions . Mixing in the hot sauce gave a little kick . Wanted something between alfredo and tomato sauce ; tbis was the one ! Would come again .<->1
Delicious dessert choices . We had the white chocolate cheesecake which was divine , the raspberry and chocolate cupcake . All had great textures and flavors<->1
Best thai food in Phoenix ! I 'm from back east and it 's hard to find good ethnic food in AZ unless you 're looking for Mexican ... After trying several places this is our go to !<->1
Went here with a group of 10 ( Sept 16 , 2014 ) . Reasonable ( $ 300 for all ) , fresh and delicious sushi . Tasty tempura . Fast , friendly staff .<->1
Tried their fries and it was pretty good . Many condiments choices . If u do n't like spicy food . U can tell them to put the pepper on the side<->1
Great wraps ! I really enjoy the chicken shawarma wrap . The falafel is good too , nice and crispy ! I come here at least once a week when I 'm in town .<->1
Great place to eat ! Excellent customer service and the food was delicious ! I really enjoyed the atmosphere ! We will definitely be returning soon !<->1
Order pizza from this place all the time ! Most amazing pizza and staff is great and super friendly ! ! Best pizza in Vegas ! !<->1
I 've heard that the food is good . If I ever see any , I might be able to add my opinion . On the up side , it only took 20 minutes to get a beer . So that 's something , I guess .<->0
Best corned beef is sold here . Everything I 've gotten from here is great . Prices are competitive as well .<->1
Wow , delicious vegan food on the Westside . Great place !<->1
The cardamom latte was spiced to perfection with just enough warmth to brighten my day ! I wish I had realized they serve brunch , another time for sure .<->1
Good thai food . Very standard fare but consistently good . I 've been here many times and ordered take out as well .<->1
Really clean place . Staff is usually friendly . Ordered online tonight so I would n't have to wait . Awesome experience ! Walked in and the " artist " gave me my sandwich and left all in about 1 minute . Will def use online ordering again !<->1
Simply amazing . It was one of the best food experiences I 've had in Las Vegas . Although it 's on the expensive side , the food was wonderful .<->1
Quite expensive . But when it 's hot out you will be glad you stopped by . Variety of flavours with a lot of fresh and sweet toppings to add . They charge by weight so do n't get too carried away .<->1
Such a great place ! We come here almost every date night for the wine and amazing food . The prices are n't cheap , but the food is unbelievable !<->1
I loved this place . Food is great , portions are generous and the atmosphere is nice . Will definitely go again .<->1
Favourite places to eat in Vegas , especially for someone who loves burgers ! I come here every time I 'm in the mood for a burger - the patties are so thick , fresh and juicy .<->1
Massively overrated . I do n't get it . Soggy crust and you need extra napkins to soak up the grease .<->0
Since San Diego 's food choices this place has done be trick for cravings I 've adopted after visiting there and I will definitely be coming back . Awesome staff awesome food .<->1
No line - up . Need I say more ? Great booths , service was fantastic , free wifi throughout , let us linger forever , food was good ( French Fries were pretty meh but you 're not hungry enough after eating the sandwich to need them ) .<->1
Rosati 's ? Out west ? Forget about it . If you 're in Phoenix and you like pizza you better order Rosati 's . If you do n't it better be because you 're busy eating right now at Oregano 's . Thin crust all day<->1
We 're waiting the breakfast to serve for over 1 hours . Do n't know what the kitchen do for cooking .<->0
This review is solely based on the matcha soft serve I ordered . I have high standard of matcha soft serve after having some legit ones in Asia and Tendou is pretty disappointing . Matcha flavour is lacking .<->2
Good eats and drinks for happy hour , love the atmosphere ! It 's a different take on the same stuff just about every other Mex - food offered .<->1
Went for lunch yesterday . Love the staff , very friendly and attentive . Had the beef pho and hubby had the kung pap , loved both .<->1
Great food , very interesting menu as we as everything apparently is made in house . Great for vegans . A but on be pricey side but certainly well worth it ! A Must go to in downtown Cleveland !<->1
Bei is bar far the best sushi restaurant in Phoenix and has awesome happy hour prices ! Manager Cody is always welcoming along with the staff . Kelsi and Melissa are always wonderful , I highly suggest checking this place out :)<->1
Food was good , the person behind the counter was very slow . There were only 2 people in line waiting , she seem very nervous .<->2
Very friendly workers , yummy nachos ! I recommend that you try it while you 're at The D !<->1
Nona did our wedding cake . I was the best cake I have ever had . Rich and moist are just a few words to describe this delicious cake . I stop by often after work to enjoy a cupcake .<->1
I simply love this place ! ! ! They carry the freshest and most sustainable fish ! The Chefs are all so friendly and knowledgeable ! SABLE FISH IS A MUST TRY !<->1
Best place to have breakfast in Las vegas , the prices are reasnable . Great service and the stuffs are great . food is tasty . I recommend this place for who ever visited LAS Vegas .<->1
Service hors pair et très sympathique . Le menu dégustation était à couper le souffle et le " pairing " des vins sensationnelles . Un des meilleures restos où j'ai mangé .<->1
Fantastic beer and a cool atmosphere . Wide variety of their own brews and plenty of other local beers to try . The Hyde beers are unique and tasty . Worth a trip .<->1
Great food and atmosphere . Food tends to be on the healthy - side . The shawarmas and salmon are the best items on the menu .<->1
Nice place , ate here tonight for the first time . Typical noise for today ' s restaurants but food was excellent and priced well . Excellent service as well .<->1
The food is just so over cooked . Why ca n't this location get it right . Better off with a frozen bag of tyson and a 6 pack of beer at home . Please send a new manager .<->0
We ordered 2 bowls of beef ball noodle soup and deep fried egg rolls . The eggs rolls were OK , nothing out of the ordinary . The broth did not have very strong beef flavor and not very tasty .<->0
Excellent food , staff and atmosphere . The decor is beautiful and the food is one of a kind . The falafel is the best I have ever had . The flat breads fresh out of their big beautiful oven are delicious .<->1
On a Sunday Funday , it 's ALWAYS a BLAST ! ! Ca n't go wrong with the " Hair of the Dog " Rose sparkling wine with jalapeno bacon ! YES !<->1
Asshole bartender in a tiny bar . Like tiny tiny . Shitty vibe .<->0
The food is outstanding ! ! Do n't miss a visit to Lotus of Siam ... and the service was excellent ! !<->1
Great Food and great atmosphare !<->1
LOVED the service here ! great place to meet for a date . very cozy patio and interior . this location is alot better than the chandler one . drinks are reasonably priced too .<->1
Arawan is gourmet Thai food . It 's located in a not good area but it 's worth the try . A must is their desserts . My husband who is Thai was impressed .<->1
Ribs were perfection ! Friendly , charming staff . Great new gem . You got ta eat here !<->1
Really cool ambiance , very open and active . Our server was great , recommending great beers and food for our undecided guests . The fries were absolutely delicious .<->1
Everything has been fantastic on several visits , but the cocktails & mozzarella are standouts !<->1
One of the 2 nicest Big Lot stores I 've been in in the U . S . So clean , neat and very good inventory .<->1
Watermelon Soju all the way , we also got the pork dumplings that came with the best dipping sauce . I got the bibimbap and my boyfriend got the kalbi . Both were so good . We will definitely be regulars here .<->1
Great drinksGreat serviceBeen here 2xs now and the food was cold , both times . I 'm not one to focus on the negative but I m worried about getting sick from not being too hot .<->2
Great place , great music and ambiance . But it is very highly priced with too few tables , meaning you often have to wait to sit .<->1
Excellent service and prices for area . Right across from the trump , so great place to get in and save a few coins versus 5xs the price in the hotel . Great service and smiles !<->1
People were awesome they are all smiling and happy . creating a good atmosphere ! And the food was great . we 've been twice already<->1
Best wings in a decade , they were absolutely perfect ! ! ! coupled with massive $ 4 bud light drafts , and Excellent service ! Best Happy Hour in town ... by far ! ! !<->1
Second time there and once again the food was good .. But the service needs improvement , the server spilled water on the table and my friend , we had to clean it up our selves and he did n't even apologize . .<->2
Place just opened and I had not ever had it so my husband and I stopped in we shared the meatball dub and the beef and cheddar brisket both were fantastic<->1
Great service ! ! ! Customer Service manager Ryan was awesome ! Will defiantly bring a group back : )<->1
Tried the New York Combo . It was good pizza . It taste like a NY pizza to me . They open the box for you to look at before you leave . I love the service .<->1
Pricy but must try at least once and make sure to sit on the counter to watch them make ur desserts . It 's entertaining ! 9/10<->1
Best buffet ever , just super expensive . Love the variety especially the different cuts of meat .<->1
pls do nt go ! chicken is undercook and smelling weird . a very bland food without no taste .<->0
I hope this place makes . I was never really into gumbo but now the craving strikes weekly and it was all because of this spot .<->1
Sat down at the bar with a buddy , waited for about 20 minutes or so while others were served and we were ignored . This place normally has really good service . What a shame .<->0
Very nice place for lunch . Casual yet stylish little place on Baldwin . Portions can feel small depending on what you end up ordering . Sashimi is really fresh . I recommend the bento box or any of the combos !<->1
Amazing .. the green beans were so delicious . Hamburger was very juicy .. had to use numerous napkins ! The place was super clean , which I always appreciate !<->1
Clean and pretty good chicken strips . The price is not bad . I do n't like it as much as my favorite chicken place which is Raising Caines but still it 's good food .<->2
Went here for my bday last night . The food is awesome , quiet , comfortable , family environment , Did I mention great customer service ! ! ! Will definitely go back .<->1
Pho was a mere okay . Nothing special . Broth seems to be made from a mix not something you would see at an authentic Vietnamese restaurant .<->0
THE FOOD IS AMAZING . Aside from the food , this place is SO adorable and relaxing ! The patio is pet friendly so fur friends are welcome :)<->1
Great local Chinese restaurant . I 've been going here ( as well as their old location ) for almost 20 years now . I have never order anything , and not been completely satisfied . Highly recommend .<->1
Very good place - the food was good - the dancers made it fun - a great place for a group .<->1
My kids and I love this place . great place to run to in this Az weather , the service is great and the variety enormous . Love their chocolate ice cream with brownie yumm .<->1
Food was really good price and so good . Tamales were amazing and tacos were really good . Goat one especially . Chilaquiles took a while to make and we 're alright , would rather try the tacos .<->1
I 've been here several times and really enjoy the food . The service can be a little slow at times though .<->1
Grilled Stickies and the Buffalo Chicken wrap are my two favorites . I ca n't wait to get them again soon ! !<->1
Food was very good , good atmosphere , good price . All around a solid Mexican food place in Vegas<->1
Pretty much you know what you 're getting and expecting if you go to this cafe in the Cali .<->1
Not much to say here . Good juicy burgers , will definitely stop by again when I 'm in the area .<->1
Arnold was very nice and put up with our late night shenanigans . Good drinks and food here !<->1
Seems like the only place for high tea in the burgh . Tea are gooooood ! Scone is good , too . Environment is marvelous . They also serve champagne .<->1
This place sometimes can get crowded but definitely worth the wait . Amazing home fries and omelets are amazing !<->1
I do n't know but the noodles always takes for me to me at that restaurant later working on cleaning water but everything Else taste OK<->0
A place worth trying . Had brunch there and the baked potatoes were very good . Got ta visit next time<->1
I like the black bean chicken BBQ salad . That 's about all I ever order . I really have n't tried anything else on the menu . But they do good fam size take out orders with my fav salad .<->2
best service I have ever experienced at a restaurant ! I would defiantly recommend trying it out<->1
We ordered a 6 " chocolate cake with fudge filling for our wedding and it was the most delicious cake we 've ever had ! ! ! Will be highly recommending and using her again in the future !<->1
Spinach artichoke dip - skip it . Worst EVER ... pureed like baby food . Gross . But lemme tell ya , BEST REUBEN of my LIFE ! ! Shrimp appetizer was good . Our server , Dominique , was great . She 's on top of it and we 're here for UFC . Packed house .<->1
Good food . Reasonable prices . Wine selection a bit short . Decor great . Only complaint is my filet was rare when I ordered medium .<->2
Amazing food ! Recommend getting reservations . I got the french martini , french onion soup , mussels appetizer , and the scallop entree ... Soooo good ! The whipped cauliflower is amazing as well . The best meal I had on strip .<->1
Great service . The food was delicious and the prices were great too . We came in the morning and ate breakfast and had a great experience . It really is authentic Mexican food . Would definitely recommend stopping by .<->1
Not a family oriented place to go . Especially on Sunday . Obnoxious sports fans and a staff that is accepting of rude behavior . Will gladly spend my money else where .<->0
Amazing food at a great price and the place is small but food and service is great . Ask for Alex the server is so much fun and put up with our craziness . Thanks Alex<->1
My husband and I love this place . We 've been coming here for years and are members of their reward club . The food and beer are delicious ... all day HH on Wednesday with great prices .<->1
The cupcake was on the dry side . Pastry pie was wet and greasy and dough was raw .<->0
I have been to many Filiberto 's but this location has the best green salsa and their CArne asada is just great<->1
Oh man . their spicy hummus is the best thing i 've ever tasted . Great food , friendly people , good sized portions !<->1
We had the awesome bang bang shrimp , which is deliciously spicy and some great fish . Ca n't go wrong with the Bonefish Grill , in my limited view .<->1
Decent restaurant with plenty of fishes , seafood and chicken on menu . I do nt eat pork or beef . Loved it .<->1
Best veggie thin crust of all time ! This place is the best in phoenix and I am obsessed ! Great service and just straight up tasty .<->1
A very classy O'Club with good food and a great bar . Make sure to stop in the Check Six for a few drinks .<->1
Nice clean well modeled store with friendly employees , good prices , great food , and it even has a Panda Express in it . Wonderful place to shop and get your groceries .<->1
We drive 45 min from home to eat here . It 's hands down still the freshest , funnest , most consistent flavors you 'll get and well worth the drive !<->1
I ca n't understand why this place is listed as 3 stars . Except for the fact it 's set amongst snobby , inauthentic " Mexican " restaurants - it 's in the heart of old down Scottdale . The best Mexican restaurant for miles hands down !<->1
Great food ! you will definitely not be hungry after this breakfast . We even got up early to drive out from the strip before our meeting for a convention just to get a good breakfast .<->1
Casbah is great for a special occasion or if you feel like splurging . The atmosphere is very nice and the food is fantastic . The beer selection is above average .<->1
We bet it all on red . And lost . Bad luck aside , this Horseshoe is clean , lively , and centrally - located .<->2
We love this place ! Had the clam chowder , Phu sandwich and Dragon fries . Spicy , fresh and beyond flavorful ! We will be back next time I visit my BFF in Henderson !<->1
Love the food here . is a lot cheaper than it 's neighbor . people are relatively nice . simple layout and good Napoleon food . the Americano pizza is incredibly goood ! !<->1
The Beef Sate Soup is the best ( in Calgary ) . The large is big enough for two , the spice is mild , and the ingredients are fresh AF.Get it .<->1
Easily the best bang for your buck Korean BBQ ! ! A must go ! The waitress ' suck but whaddya expect at a buffet ? The food is awesome !<->1
Literally reminded me of the islands and it was amazing . So good and I would recommend<->1
I enjoyed it the options they have really good service and place to relax and enjoy icecreams with friends ! ! Totally recommend !<->1
I 've only been once , it was good pho , pretty cheap , and reasonably fast . I would n't say it was anything spectacular but worth it if you 're in the mood .<->2
I love this place . The Pho is excellent , and the service is prompt . I have always been able to get in and out during luncheon time .<->1
Excellent food and wine . The atmosphere on the patio was great too . Just far enough away from the street , but not too far . I 'd go back there anytime , but it 's especially nice at dusk ...<->1
This place does not deserve 4 stars , the food was ok but nothing exceptional . The guacamole was tasteless which was disappointing and the rice was a bit too spicy . Shrimp was good though .<->0
I really enjoy the food , atmosphere , and service at Graze . Always a solid choice in my book .<->1
Great food , bacon is awesome . Frittatas and kielbasa breakfast sandwich are a nice change of pace .<->1
Customer service and management are both much better after I called corporate . They are now showing marked improvement .<->0
Poppy Den is going downhill , fast . Do n't waste your time .. just go next door to Cantina Laredo or The View if you want a relaxing place to hang out .<->0
Their staff absolutely crushes it . Customer service is off the charts for fast food . Food came out hot and fresh - standard Wendy 's date done well .<->1
I thought this place was okay . I Had the Eggs Benedict and I thought it was pretty small for the price they had it for .<->2
Ridiculously disappointed . Came to my favorite dining spot at the airport only to find that they do n't serve breakfast burritos . I am really ! ! ! You are a Mexican food restaurant ! ! !<->0
Put me on hold for 20 minutes to avoid doing their job . They just hope you hang up and go elsewhere to eat . Total joke of a business .<->0
I have eaten there a couple times and just have never been impressed . The food is ok , but not amazing .<->0
My family loves this place the food has always been delicious . No complaints from us and the staff is awesome !<->1
Great food ! ! ! Their red potatoes are amazing . Service was slow , but worth the wait . Went for Sunday Brunch , but they do not serve alcohol on Sunday 's b<->1
Really good food ! The menu has many options unique to everyone 's own taste . There 's even a section in the menu which is vegan . The food overall is good and the customer service is too .<->1
my favourite place for pho very tasty broth i ve tried alot.of other place but this place jus tasted better<->1
Made a reservation for my wife 's birthday and the food and service was top notch . Party of 8 and everyone was very satisfied .<->1
Pretty good . I like their daily deaks on food and drinks . Usually come here witb friends after an exam for drinks . Good service<->1
Tried the corned beef and the pastrami . Both were very good . Would definitely return when in the area . Would consider for a catered event too .<->1
Food good . Service mediocre at best ... 10 workers three customers and no greeting at all ... Made me feel like I was bothering him ...<->2
Beautiful atmosphere , I think we were the wrong color . Maybe if we had on are uniforms we would have been welcome . Still lovin ' Surprise Arizona<->0
This is the closest I have come to my mother 's in law cooking , who is from Thailand . The food was fresh and cooked wonderfully .<->1
New to the neighborhood . Very nice interior and menu . Friendly atmosphere . Waffle sandwich for today 's lunch . Remember cash only .<->1
For a few hundred per person , I ve had better sushi , but it was still good eats . I actually preferred their hot dishes better ( the black cod is like butter ) .<->1
Food was good . Came an hour and half before closing . Very pleasant until they discretely tried to hurry us up by giving us the check when I was n't done eating yet . Still an ok place .<->2
I have to say that place is great There food is # 1 IN LAS VEGAS Will keep come over And will recommend them always<->1
Yummy burgers . Great staff ! ! ! Love the pink lemonade.it ' s always full and cold ( never warm at this location ) . Great prices as always . I love getting the burger with a lettuce wrap instead of the bun .<->1
Decent middle eastern grocery store . They have almost everything you might look for . Not everything taste as good as it looks so do nt get too excited . Not bad overall<->2
The best Shawarma in Ontario . affordable prices , clean , friendly and delicious .<->1
Great food family friendly John the manager over the top nice . My new fav spot . UFC night here we come . Great TVs .<->1
Love , love , love this place . We typically go on Saturday morning for amazing crepes and delicious coffee or Chai Tea . We recommend this place to many .<->1
Awesome gelato . Awesome pizza and pasta . I like the kiwi and pineapple best . The staff were really friendly . Clean atmosphere and short lines make it a great place to eat quick .<->1
Cool place , great country music and the BEST FRIES EVER ! ! ! You have to order the French fries . They 're sooooo good .<->1
I absolutely love this location . the atmosphere , the food , the people . I loved everything about this place . I will recommend to everyone I know . TY !<->1
My breakfast and my boyfriends was very bland . We got the waffles and the blueberry lemon pancakes . The pancakes did n't even slightly taste like lemon and the waffles were mediocre . Although the presentation was nice , I wo n't be coming back .<->0
Awesome food , very well organized . You get a lot for what you pay for . Tina is very helpful and friendly . Will come back and recommend to others !<->1
Tried this place on the recommendation of a friend . It was fantastic and the owners are super friendly . I had the lunch chicken special which was very tasty and affordable . Ca nt wait to go and try some more yummy food .<->1
Went here with a Meetup group . The food was amazing . We got to have complementary appetizers , the stuffed mushroom were to die for ! ! Parking was free , overall the atmosphere is trendy , very artsy .<->1
Kinda dead on a Friday . More people should come down its got a nice atmosphere . Good beers good spirits semi good company .<->2
Maybe I had a bad experiance here ... But everything I had was below average ( omelete and regular pancakes ) . I much prefer the cracked egg just down the road .<->0
It never disappoints . The flavors are excellent and the staff is so friendly . Worth the drive to come here . Blows casino ice cream and gelato out of the water .<->1
Roger was attentive . Food was amazing . Even got a margarita and it was on point ! Could not be happier with my experience . Always good when I go somewhere , enjoy the food , and so does my kid .<->1
The service was good , the food was amazing . I wish they would 've turned on the music from the kitchen on for the dining area .<->1
No Cookies n Cream flavor ? Automatic 2 star deduction . Otherwise it was good & I liked the discounts with Foursquare check in ( 10 % off ) & if you provide your cell # for an extra 6 cents off ea ounce .<->2
The name speaks for itself . Great smells from the place with straight forward items with unique twists ( i . e . orchid latte ) . It 's a must check out place .<->1
Best biscuits in town ! I love this place ! Great food ! Everything I have had here is excellent !<->1
Great food is worth the wait - and this is beyond great food ! Staff is wonderful , sushi is excellent , atmosphere is comfortable . Worth many repeat visits so that I can try everything on the menu !<->1
Wow ... i was very impressed . Only $ 5 ... I loved the Gobernador ... The Mahi Mahi was tasty but Gobernador was tops ... lots of shrimps on pulled pork ... mmmmmm ... ca n't wait to go back ... :)<->1
Attached to The Le ' Place D ' Armes Hotel . Did n't go for lunch or dinner but they do a very nice brunch . Service is amazing ( same as the hotel ) would absolutely go back !<->1
Love this place ! ! This is exactly what we need . Healthy fast food ! !<->1
Their crepes are amazing ! Get extra Nutella if you know what 's good for you . Everybody raves about their drinks too but I usually stick with a water or maybe ice tea .<->1
Seriously , this by far one of the breakfast places I 've ever been to . The eggs are so fresh . It 's always been a wait when I 've come here but that 's alright with me , it 's so worth it !<->1
I find the quality is on a downward trend in recent years . Tends to be greasy with poorer food quality . I would probably go with 1.5 stars .<->0
My fav rolls are the salmon holic and something wrong # 7 one of the best places in Vegas ! ! Pricey . Worth every dime<->1
Excellent tasting pizza . Many different varieties . I come here often for lunch during the work day . Friendly staff and clean .<->1
Clean . Fast and friendly service . The panang avocado with shrimp was delicious ! Will dine here again .<->1
This is definitely a cool spot in a really great location with some delicious coffee , we highly recommend a trip to Cafe Novo .<->1
Great beer selection and the burgers are tasty . Very different selection vs your typical bar burgers . Nice work<->1
Cute little brewery ! Always feel welcome . :) my favorite is cruising down the street and peach sour !<->1
I love True Food Kitchen and highly recommend it to my family and friends . That said , I was highly disappointed with the new curry dish -- I was truly addicted to the old preparation . PLEASE BRING IT BACK !<->1
We 've been here several times always a great meal . But last night was the Best ever , my wife 's Birthday , we had 11 guests . The food and entertainment were the BEST ! We will definitely be back for more great food ,<->1
Yummy food and a nice dining area make this place a winner . There were four vegetarian main courses to choose from . One thing that was curious was that they had no appetizers on the menu .<->1
Great food . I never imagined that that little place has so much good food . However , the facade of the restaurant does look to attractive but the interior is good and food amazing .<->1
Ordered a couple of items for pick up , arrived 25 minutes later , and they sold the food to someone else . Good thing we did n't prepay .<->0
I prefer this location over the sahara one . This place has more seafood and it seems different kinds of seafood dishes after 4 pm sometimes . It is closer to my to home .<->1
One of the best happy hours in the valley , great service and delicious food . $ 5 rolls during happy hour . Hail satan .<->1
A little dissappointed ! Maybe my hopes we 're too high . This buffet did not have a good selection of food . In my opinion , the food did not look good or taste good either .<->2
Great beer store find . A lot of IPAs , 14 beers on draft in an unassuming location . Support local .<->1
Bon restaurant . Le buffet à volonté est assez varié et la nourriture est bonne ! Cependant , quelques points négatifs : les serveurs sont froids et distants , pas de réel contact . Ils oublient souvent de vous apporter certains plats que vous avez commandé ...<->2
This place was phenomenal ! Service , food , atmosphere all an A + . We will definitely be back . Vladimir was a magician making the martinis<->1
Always fast and friendly . I love the pork or chicken gyros . Stuffed grape leaves are also great . Can also get side of gyro meat .<->1
Service and the food was executed flawlessly . Hands down the best steak I have ever tasted and the Tuna Tartare appetizer is a must have .<->1
We had excellent service during their busy lunch hour . My shrimp enchiladas were very tasty and I would definitely go back . Highly recommended and when you go as for Brandi ! She goes above and beyond .<->1
Wonton Lo Mein Noodle took half an hour to receive after other food came out . Food was okay , portion size is decent , but they had pesky flies at our table .<->0
Been here 3 times since I moved here . Service and food are great . The chorizo omelet is definitely a good breakfast .<->1
Best middle - eastern grills in Montreal by far ! ! Came in fast , food was worm They also sent Salad with food Also I recommend fried cheese borek it was amazing<->1
I highly recommend this place , to me this is the very best Mexican food in Toronto . Absolutely delicious food , reasonable prices , served with a smile . What more can you ask for !<->1
Do n't order delivery . Over an hour after a 40 minute quote , and I live less than 4 miles from the restaurant . Previous pizzas have been burnt .<->0
Great beers ... Outstanding ! ! ! But their award winning hamburger was way beneath our expectations . We will order something different next time ... WAY over rated ... but the beer selection was wonderful .<->1
Excellent restaurant in Vdara . Quite and reserved , yet intimate . The food is fantastic .<->1
As Vietnamese American who from central Vietnam , I 'm surprise to find good bun bo Hue at Mai Lan . My kids love the pho here too .<->1
It was great service was quick friendly really enjoyed the garlic shrimp place was clean and left completely stuffed<->1
this store is SLOW AF ... especially the drive thru ... and they do n't get your order right at times ...<->0
I got a caterpillar roll and a California roll . Both were standard , but still good . I would definitely come back for the strawberry mochi ice cream though !<->1
Great place . Bartender was very nice and helpful . Huge selection of beers and decent crab cakes .<->1
This place was amazing ! Great chocolate and fudge selection and tasty ice cream ! Very friendly staff as well !<->1
I would give this place zero stars if possible . Terrible food , terrible service . And the worst of all , the " chef " placed raw chicken right next to cooked fish on the grill , handling with same spatula . Disgusting .<->0
Pretty great while searching for a buffet . The food is stocked constantly . The Mongolian grill was a nice surprise and the service was excellent .<->1
Very cool place , super nice staff and love the cookie samples . Super cute packaging and they offer a purchase card program to earn free cookies . Tons of different tasty flavors . Glad we stopped in .<->1
Great selection of cigars ! The owner was very nice and helpful . The prices were a little steep but coming from the US , a good cuban is n't always easy to come by .<->1
Sur ma liste des meilleurs " Apportez votre vin " à Montréal ! Cuisine créative et savoureuse . Situé sur le Plateau alors il est suggéré de venir en transport en commun , surtout en hiver . Sinon , prévoyez un délai pour vous stationner .<->1
Service was a little slow , but it was summer so I understand slow season . Not usually a salad fan , but it was huge and good .<->1
They keep his place like an icebox ! Music is way too loud , you ca n't even have a conversation at your table .<->0
Awesome food and drinks , not too fond of the chips though ( the seasoning is odd ) . Many margarita flavors and they are very good . There arnt too many texmex places around anymore<->1
My first trip to Morning Owl was a pleasant surprise . Plenty of seating a good place for an afternoon coffee with friends . I had the Brazilian French press my favorite way to enjoy a cup of coffee . Was very good .<->1
Service was not good , place felt dirty . Pepper and parmesan shakers were slick with grease or something . Pizza was great though . Recommend making a takeout order and NOT dining in .<->2
Tried the California Burrito . Man , that carne asada and yummy fries sure go good together . I will be back to try the other menu items .<->1
There 's nothing wrong with Hemingway 's , but there 's nothing special either . I 'm mostly just disappointed that it claims to be New Zealander , but does n't have a single NZ or Aussie beer on the menu . Seriously .<->0
They 've added a gluten free menu . I highly recommend the chicken avocado salad . The burritos are good , servings are huge . Great salsa too . Really nice servers . I 've never had the brunch but it looks good on the menu .<->1
Lavender and almond ice cream = perfection . I love Millie 's . Unique flavors and quality ice cream what more could you ask for .<->1
My Haven . The music , The ambience and the people is just ... Awesome . Thank You for having and opening this store for everybody .<->1
Yummy is all I can say and the wine beverages are to die for ! Great happy hour and wonderful service too ! Do n't miss this place or you will loose out on some really good food .<->1
If you are looking for a real European Bakery experience , this is the place to go , you would not be disappointed .<->1
I 've wanted this concept in Hawaii for a decade ! Great tasting dogs and sides as well . Great beer selection too .<->1
Food is just ok . Not up to the areas standard . Long wait is expected before seating . Things feel rushed . As usual expect poor service and yet you have to fork out lots tips despite you being unhappy with service .<->0
You suck GABB . You 're bagel sucks . Your 4 slices of deli roast beef sucks . You not cutting it in half sucks . Please leave this airport so a Burger King can take your place . One star for the bag of Dorritos .<->0
Great lunch spot ! Wonderful food ! Service is quick and efficient . Always busy !<->1
Fresh and tasty food ! A bit on the pricy side but very good . Try the green tea & tropical drink mixed together .<->1
I highly recommend this place ! The food and service was amazing ! Our server , Ethan , was extremely helpful and accommodating . Excellent choice !<->1
First time in Vegas and really glad I came ! Great breakfast if you 're on this side of town<->1
Chips were great . Queso Dip with Chorizo watery . Tamal too starchy . Chile Rellenos passable , pepper undercooked . Gold Margaritas good , not great . About whatI would expect in Streetsboro . :)<->2
Amazing ! Homemade biscuits . Delicious food . I would eat here everyday if I could ! ! !<->1
Truly enjoyed thier food here . Went with another family and got Parrillada De Tres Carnes . I highly recommend - its now my favorite Mexican Restaurant in AZ .<->1
Super friendly staff , incredibly good food that is macro friendly and is easy on the stomach . Ashley is super friendly and always remembers my face and makes great recommendations .<->1
I seriously love this place . The food is always fresh , the flavors are outstanding , and the staff is always smiling , helpful and attentive .<->1
Way better than Mineos . A slicer of Pepperoni & a slice of Margherita and you 're good to go . Crust is wonderful . Sauce is a little on the sweet side , but I can overlook that .<->1
Awesome Thai little spot . Mom and PA spot with great food ! The portion size is filling , Will eat here again for sure ! !<->1
Good food , good quick service ! Steak tacos the best . Chicken quesadillas also good .<->1
Toujours une bonne option avant un spectacle au st - denis ! La bouffe est bonne et la bière aussi ! Ils viennent de renover un étage complet alors c'est le temps de passer faire un tour<->1
I was here when they first open jjam - ppong was really good . Now is mediocre . I just ca n't understand why they ca n't make food taste consistently . Service is good . Noddles cook just right .<->1
Great service . The sushi was absolutely average . The appetizer ( some kind of pepper ) was horrible . The best part of the dinner was the see weed salad with octopus and the sake . We were disappointed .<->0
Finally a Popeye 's in a decent location ! Great service and clean facilities . Food is the usual Popeye 's brand no complaints whatsoever . Staff is quick and friendly . Ample parking in the plaza where it 's located .<->1
Fast and friendly service . Their # 5 grilled pork is my standby . Everything is on - point , though nothing stands out as exceptional . But it 's a bahn mi chain , and that in itself is pretty damn awesome .<->1
There is no better pie this side of the Atlantic ... So glad they visit so many local Farmers Markets spread the pie - shaped love farther than Westlake<->1
Cooked perfectly , very friendly staff . A bit too oily for me , so i 'd recommend a good straining before the sauce goes on .<->1
tried their house special pho . portion is decent but lacks quite a bit of flavour . might be good for health conscious crowd who wants less salt , but not up to expectation for a pho soup base .<->2
It 's was the perfect place to eat after a long weekend at edc shout out to Jamie for being a dope sever ! So good we went twice in a week . Ariel was amazing too ! Best experience<->1
Breakfast for kings ! ! ! Omelette with cheese is on point , there bagels are the best in the city .<->1
I do n't eat beef , so the clerk gave me a veggie burger . It 's good tho .<->1
I 'm a transplant from the northeast and Rocco 's is legit NY pizza . As good and authentic as the places in my old neighborhood - I was very glad to discover Rocco 's .<->1
The pizza was mediocre at best . I ordered a roasted veggie , and I honestly prefer the Kashi frozen pizza over Manolo 's version , which was greasy and a bit too crunchy . It was also a bit too pricey considering the quality .<->0
Un bon restaurant apportez votre vin dans Hochelaga ! Les brunchs sont aussi géniaux et l'ambiance du restaurant est intéressante et le décor surprenant ! À découvrir !<->1
Slowest drive thru in the entire valley . Expect to wait at least 15 - 20 minutes in the drive thru or inside the restaurant .<->0
Great place to bring the kids ! Love Hershey 's everything . If u have yet to visit I highly recommend . There 's also a Hershey 's bar so u can spike your martini or shake if that 's your style .<->1
Coffee on the strip - who can complain about that ? Same location as Sbarro , Subway , Del Taco , Dairy Queen & Orange Julius ... Starbucks coffee made my day !<->1
Had an outing with the girl 's , and it was great first time here and I 'll definitely be going back . Great food ! ! ! The Duce itself is quite different , but food . I recommend it<->1
The food is great ... I highly recommend the hard tacos combo , the rice and beans taste fresh and not canned / pre - processed ... also the cilantro margarita is to die for ! !<->1
I love this location . Prices are normal for this chain andparking is convenient . Pretty quick service and lots of smiles<->1
The burgers were average , the fries were great . The atmosphere was awful ! Small tables , super loud music . I wanted dinner not a club atmosphere . I 'd eat there again but it definitely would not be my first choice .<->0
Went to get coffee at 8 : 30pm . Store was closed . Both website and store sign said open until 9 pm . Not a good way to do business .<->0
Amazing breakfast . Omlettes looked great . Their potatoes werr great ... sautéed i think . Bloody mary was fresh tomatoe juice . Orange juice was fresh and lovely . Manh many eggs Benedicts ... looked great . Smoked meat in my omlette was a good addition . Recommended for breakfast !<->1
My spicy tangerine beef was raw . I can feel myself getting sick .<->0
Love this place ! It has improved a lot over the months . For a chain , I like it a lot . The beers are cheap . 36 oz for $ 9.25 . Yes , please . I love the mussels , too . Always returning for more<->1
My most favorite restaurant ! ! Everything is top notch ! Carne asada , the red rice , black bean sweet potato tacos and goat cheese guacamole are all amazing .<->1
Bought a couple of buns from here as snacks to go with our HK style tea . Everything was fresh . The winter melon pastry is especially tasty . Best I 've tried .<->1
I love this place . The food , the service , and the atmosphere is just fantastic . I 'm such a sucker for houses converted into restaurants .<->1
Still awesome . I order delivery quite frequently . YUM<->1
Love this Place . Always worth a Trip .<->1
Waited months for this store to open near my home . I hope they fold . Over priced , free range , gluten free crap ... I 'll never shop here . Give me a real neighborhood grocery store !<->0
Totally my type of place . All small plates but not too tiny . Portions and concepts totally reek street food . Been 3 times now and have n't had the same dish twice . I will frequent here often !<->1
Do n't eat here . This place is so disgusting . Let me just say when the waiter placed the food on the table , a huge roach appeared from somewhere and was running across the table . Worst experience ever .<->0
This is the best Mexican food in town . The portions are huge , the service is good , and the prices are reasonable . The machaca and the red chili beef are both exceptionally good .<->1
Great service and delicious food . I had the French toast with banana strawberry and blueberries . 5,50 $ . Great value .<->1
I would really like this place if the music was n't so loud . Turn the f $ & @ing music down ! ! ! It is ear piercing loud ! ! !<->0
Inizio Pizza is the " da Michele " of Charlotte . And if you know about pizza , you know this is crazy good .<->1
Killer menu . One of my favorite dining experiences in Las Vegas . Our waiter spent time with us and knew every little detail about the restaurant and the menu . I 'll be back ... many times :)<->1
Fabulously diverse menu , delicious food , and superb service . Classy spot ! Ca n't wait to go back ! Party of 6 and we all loved our meals and the experience ! C<->1
Bomb.com thanks it was the best bbq ever . I will be back . All the way from the 206 . You have to come eat here . Service was a 10 for sure<->1
Love there sandwiches ! ! Even my picky kiddos love it ! ! They 're all amazing you need to try it not your ordinary sandwich !<->1
We have been hear at least 5 times and truly enjoy it ! Everything we 've tried from the menu has been delicious and the service is always great ! So nice to have a great spot to eat so close to home .<->1
Totally impressed with Trattoria Bianco . Excellent all around , from the pizza , to the small plates , pasta dishes and dessert ( except for the amaretto cake ) . Perfect bread , great setting .<->1
Interesting ... Within days after I mention on Yelp about all of the Pigeon Crap on their sign , they finally decided to clean it all up ! I guess their reading the reviews on here ...<->0
Awesome ! Great food ! Great service ! We had the hanger steak and pork chops . Amazing ! Wonderful way to spend our last night in Cleveland .<->1
Great food great service the Extras are bomb . Staff is friendly . Wait time is never an issue .<->1
Delicious fine dining . Food is small portion sizes , but that 's to be expected from French cuisine . Our bartender / server was knowledgable and provided fantastic drink and food recommendations .<->1
Delicious coffee ! ! Love the traditional Mexican sweets you use to come up with this amazing combinations of coffee ! ! Will definitely come back to try the whole menu<->1
I love their Gyro time sandwiches . Bob the owner is a great friend of mine . I also like their Hummas with the dipping pita bread and cumcumbers . You have got ta go today .<->1
When ever I visit Vegas I try to make it a point to visit this place once before I leave . Great staff . Food comes such with the ayce . Great taste . I will constantly repeat .<->1
Hands down the best sushi spot on the strip . The food is exquisite and the service is exceptional . Pricey but it 's well worth the experience .<->1
Sushi was great but their lobster rolls are to die for . I 'm officially hooked .<->1
Great wings .. menu looks delicious .. looking forward to trying the cuban sandwich on the way back through here .. friendly and helpful bartender<->1
Came here for Sunday brunch , the pasta was pretty good .<->2
They can be pricey for a Larger Family , however they are really good . They are casual and dressy . There beer is GREAT !<->1
This is a great place to go with the family . Ask for grilled vegetables instead of rice and beans , they are awesome .<->1
Tried the new location on rural and broadway . Service was fast and friendly . Ordered the roast beef and the Mediterranean chicken . Both were really good . Will definitely be going back again to try more .<->1
Best family place without a side of fries . Love the quiet yet fun atmosphere . This is n't Chucky Cheese , this is a place to sit down with your family and have a nice meal with your family and friends .<->1
Excellent fried chicken , but their egg waffles are to die for ! Very nice service too which is important . I would highly recommend this place as it 's a very chill spot to fulfill your korean fried chicken cravings .<->1
Delicious and dangerous now that they have to go window . Lots of unique things on menu that are updated regularly making it an adventure , besides the spicy Bbq sauce .<->1
Best Indian food one can get in Urbana - Champaign . The service is slow but worth the wait ! I land up here once or twice every week .<->1
Great wines by the glass and the new management has made this the stop on the west side . Excellent happy hour and great staff .<->1
I had the ceviche and it was very delicious . Will definitely come back to try the other dishes on the menu . Highly recommend this place !<->1
Fries were amazing , the beans are great , coleslaw is fresh and the beef ribs are excellent .<->1
Great dinner , horrible service . 4 girls , lots of excellent food and wine . Had to ask for bread , water and then we were n't even offered dessert .<->0
A bit pricey but great yogurt and there are coupons a lot . Wide variety of toppings and yogurt flavors . Great treat !<->1
Love this place , I get the chicken tacos every time . Rice and beans are great , and the hot sauce is homemade .<->1
The only Korean bbq place I love to go to . OZZY was very attentive . He checked in on us every few minutes or so . If you enjoy bbq come visit very welcoming environment great food good time ! !<->1
Spaetzle like my aunt 's , pickled cucumbers like my dad 's . Crispy schnitzel was a tad salty , but still very fine .<->1
Fantastic food and very pleasant and helpful staff . We live nearby and I am sorry that we waited so long to try this place . Reasonable prices and large serving .<->1
Upgrading my previous review . Service has greatly improved there in the past few months . Food is still OK but not great and the bathrooms still need to be cleaner .<->2
I gave this place a second chance . The food has improved greatly . Staff is also friendly . Not many people .<->1
We love this place we came here for 6 ppl first time and server were so helpful ! I came back for the second time ! Price are reasonable !<->1
Fun atmosphere . Friday night Cosmo martinis are great , but the Saturday grapefruit margaritas are my absolute favorite ! Food is always tasty as well . Great laid back restaurant in Sharon Square !<->1
Best ice cream EVER ! ! ! I got the turtle sundae . I normally do n't even like vanilla ice cream but it was delicious !<->1
I live in TO . I drove 6 hours to Montreal last July just to eat in this restaruants and it was worth every minute of my time .<->1
The staff here is awesome . The food is pretty good , too . We always sit at the bar and they take care of us :) i love all the different salsas and the blood orange margarita is a must !<->1
We tried this place for the first time and was pleasantly surprised . The pizza was very good and the delivery was quick .<->1
Very tasty sandwiches , but they are huge . The service was great , the guy behind the counter helped guide me through the menu which is also huge . I was impressed and will return<->1
The freshest donuts I have ever had ! The cake and fluffy donuts were equally delicious . They melt in your mouth ! Yum ! !<->1
Very good . Ribs and brisket 5 stars . The pulled pork was a little dry . If you like a strong mustard potato salad that s what they have . Pork pit beans are great . Mac and cheese good . I will definitely come back .<->1
Love the place ... we eat here every year when we come to Surfaces ... love Their Irish ales and my favorite is the Rubens<->1
Excellent donuts ! ! TJ rocks ! ! 10/10 service and recommendations for donut flavors ! Try the cotton candy donut ! ! Thanks TJ !<->1
had it again .. armed with more knowledge , I ordered , I ate , I enjoyed even more than the first time ... upgrading to 5<->1
I had the scallops and my date had the filet mignon . The bread basket and entrees were very tasty and I loved the decor ~ !<->1
Spacious beautiful setting with great service and really really delicious food is can safely say this could be the best .<->1
Good food , but you are paying for the view of the Bellagio . Go at night and try to get a table near the windows to watch the Bellagio fountains .<->1
Jessica is the greatest server ever ! She was so nice and calm with our rather large group . I love this place and I 'll come back soon !<->1
We had steak frites and duck . The duck was excellent but steak is a little thin , dry , chewy and greasy . Will be back for the atmosphere but not the food<->2
Good stuff ! Great burger and a yummy grilled hot dog ! Our daughter loved the strawberry lemonade .<->1
This place has character . This is a great laid back taco , quesadilla and burrito place . Nothing fancy but everything is good .<->1
Croissants , kouign - amanns , quiches , coffee .. Everything is absolutely tasty , made on the spot and therefore super fresh ! I 'd not be tired to go there every day for my breakfast goodies :)<->1
Impeccable service , very quick and efficient . On top of that the food is delicious and always consistent . We go there on a regular basis and are NEVER disappointed !<->1
Yummy ! We got a dozen for a dinner and everyone loved them ! The red chili pork are SO good .<->1
Their sushi is delicious . Their service is great and prompt . The food came out quickly . Love the omg roll and the presentation the staff does along with it .<->1
Service was fantastic . Kathy took great care of us ! She let us know her favorites , made sure we enjoyed our meals and that we were happy . We would definitely come back !<->1
We are here tonight and I have to say it was great , the burgers / sandwiches we had were amazing we will be back for sure .<->1
It was great . It is very beautiful and delicious . If you are not a smoker , you can smell the strong smell of smoke<->1
Outstanding food ! ! ! The Nachos are awesome and probably the best we 've ever had .<->1
First time here , ordered ropa vieja and plantaines , everything fresh and home made , food was great ca n't wait until i come back again to try something new , live music was a nice touch<->1
Great breakfast spot . The Coffee cake is very soft and moist . I want more ! Cracked egg sandwich was good . Lucy scramble was normal . Overall , good breakfast spot .<->1
Waiting for an appointment , there really is n't much around the appt . But this Starbucks is in the Fry 's across the street ... Nice ! !<->1
Delicious salad with an awesome concept . I agree with the reviewer who said it 's like a Chipotle for salads . Well priced , too ! Highly recommend for lunch or take - out .<->1
Great spot to karaoke ! ! Mirrors all around the room , service is awesome too . I have not tried any food yet though !<->1
My son says you are the best . Looking forward to your excellent food and service .<->1
The food is great . The service is great . I really like quick delivery and this is by far the best sushi in Toronto .<->1
This is a fantastic Little great Decor great service great drinks really enjoyed it I will be back<->1
For the price they have a varied selection . You will get your money 's worth . Every time I have been the food has been pretty fresh . Consider that it is a buffet . Good food and plenty of it .<->1
They NEVER answer the phone ! At lunch I do not have time to wait 15 - 20 min for my order I need to call it in to pick it up . The food is good but this is a joke !<->0
Fantastic food yet again ! Great combinations of ingredients to make a great burger !<->1
The cauliflower rice bowl with added grilled chicken ... my new favorite on days when I 'm working out and need something filling and light . Try it , you wo n't be sorry :-)<->1
I got the tofu cheese cake for my boyfriend 's birthday and he loved it . Tiramisu and chestnut roll are also recommended ( he loved them too )<->1
A little more than we wanted to spend on coffee and breakfast burritos , but very good . We will visit again .<->1
Despite the other reviews , I had a great experience with the customers service from Steven . Prompt , patient , and correct . Great first impression from this chain restaurant !<->1
The tacos were small , but tasty . Chips and salsa good . The burritos looked big and really good . I 'll try one next time . Helpful waitress . The owner did a shot with some tourists next to me . They had a great time !<->1
Had the brisket sandwich . The meat was tough and not tasty at all . It also made me nauseous and sick to my stomach . The cornbread was dry too ... I will not be back .<->0
Friendly , quick , correct and delicious . All I really expect from slightly overpriced fast food and would gladly overpay for again .<->1
Delectable fried chicken , collard greens & cornbread ! Wishing there was a Lo - Lo 's back home in MO !<->1
A hole - in - the - wall eatery for take - out or counter service . Food is inexpensive and heavy . The pralines were good , but the rest left me with regrets .<->0
Really enjoyed our lunch today ! ! The Loaded Baked Potato soup was AMAZING ! ! We are definitely coming back here ! !<->1
One of the best spots I found in Montreal ! Sandwiches are great . I sat in a nice little reading spot at the front but the yard looked really lovely too ! Friendly service , Will definitely come back here .<->1
I had the banananutella waffle with a side of fruit and it was light tasting , not too sweet , yummy ! The cup of fruit was a pretty good size for $ 1 . Next time I 'll try a smoothie .<->1
This is our favorite sushi place in town . Big tasty sushi rolls for a very reasonable price . The renovated the place a year or two ago so the ambience is good too . I highly recommend this and the goodyear locations .<->1
View was amazing watching all the planes . Atmosphere was good and the beer was great . Food was okay at best<->2
I 'm pretty sure I got food poisoning from eating here . I ordered at the takeout bar and the woman who took my order was very rude . Overall , very poor experience .<->0
Outstanding place to eat . Service gets slow when busy but always worth the wait .<->1
I 've been here a couple of times for brunch and it 's always been just the ticket ! The coffee is exceptional and the atmosphere is wonderful . If you get the chance , try the duck confit hash . Absolutely amazing !<->1
If you like Irish pubs , this is it . No nonsense , proper drinks , great staff . Cheers .<->1
The staff was friendly but I was n't impressed with the burrito . It was good but not GREAT . I did like the Mexican mixed with sushi vibe ... berry creative . Might give it another try .. might not . So so<->1
Bought a whole roasted chicken here , it was pretty good . The place is very busy on weekends , but the selection seems good .<->2
Meh and Meh again , Decor looks like i stumbled out of a vintage shop , but more importantly , the coffee ( Americano ) was not the best . there are better speciality coffee places around .<->0
I thought this place was very average . I do n't know what all the hype is about . I tried the original which is roast beef as well as the turkey club . Both were good but nothing spectacular .<->2
We had the Barrio food truck for our grad party . It really added the " cool " factor . Everyone loves Barrio . And the employees on the truck are top notch .<->1
Great service and food ... Enjoy the atmosphere . Great place to watch sport .. offers an upstairs for private parties .<->1
Great atmosphere ! Wonderful food at a great price ! Cecelia , our waitress , was amazing !<->1
Best pizza I have ever tasted very good prices not overly expensive friendly staff I will definitely be coming back to this place<->1
Everything from the service to the food to the ambiance was on point . The quality of the ingredients is apparent from the first bite . I ca n't wait to go back .<->1
Easily the best BBQ in vegas ! The Duke fries are absolutely AMAZING and do n't forget about The God 's Sauce ! ! !<->1
This place is off the hook . Sliced beef brisket , mac cheese , and creamy coleslaw . Just awesome ... and big portions !<->1
Food was flavorful and menu was acceptable . Ate there during an hour long lunch and our server 's attentiveness was the great . I 'll go back again .<->2
I give this location 5 stars for their superior customer service ! The food quality is great as well . What a nice visit - the Tuscan chicken sanwich is awesome !<->1
Great good and service . I recommend it if you 're looking for authentic Mexican food . Family owned and operated .<->1
Went to dinner on my business trip here . The price of food was high compared to other places I 've been . Quality was OK but portions were small . Expect to spend about $ 150 for 2 people for some rolls & entrees .<->0
Excellent place Wonderful decor Delicious cuisine Super attentive staffAnother one for CHEF NAT ! ! !<->1
For all the hype , I was n't impressed . The food was good , but I thought the prices were high for what you get . I would try it again though , to see if my mind changes .<->0
Great food and even greater staff . Sat in front of one of the Chet 's / owner and had an amazing time .<->1
Loved it ! Came with the hubby and my 4 yr old and loved the flavor and knew my body was getting good nutrients<->1
This place tries to take advantage of you if you start a tab . DO NOT start a tab here . My bill was $ 24 for 1 gin and tonic .<->0
The chicken Panang was very good . I had a 7 spice level and it had a nice kick . You will not be disappointed .<->1
Food is delicious , service is exceptional ! So happy they are in the North . I do nt have to drive far to get my Korean BBQ fix now ! !<->1
I wish I could post a better review but this neighborhood bar is avg . at best . Service is inconsistent as well as the food . Stay away from the calamari . Beer is ok , I guess .<->0
YUM ! ! ! I ordered the Southern Dump Truck last night and I 'm thinking about getting it again tonight ! ! ! My hubby ordered the switch burger , perfectly cooked ! ! The staff was super friendly ! We love this place !<->1
By far one of my favorite restaurants in Las Vegas . The restaurant is bright and clean . The food is orgasmic and the view is beautiful looking down onto the streets of Las Vegas . You wo n't be disappointed with this choice .<->1
Great authentic Korea BBQ . It 's a nice small restaurant . You either order individual orders of meat or a set menu . It 's plain meat and it comes with assortments of soup , side dishes and lettuce . Great spot .<->1
Casual lunch day with the family . Service was very good ! Loved the vegetable burrito options . Daily specials are innovative . Fresh ...<->1
Employees are untrained and unable to do returns . How are y' all over the age of 30 and no one knows how to do a return .<->0
Food was good . Price was good . Expected a little more taste but overall a good place to eat when wanting a hot dog w a twist . Their food choices are more than I expected .<->1
Best pizza in Scottsdale by far . Perfect neopolitan style pizza . Bartender also recommended an Italian beer that I 've never had before . It was great .<->1
I keep reading about the " endless mimosas " in brunch reviews ... is this something new ? When I was there for brunch 2 weeks ago , I asked for a second glass of mimosa , and was charged $ 6.00 for it ? ? ? ! ! !<->2
Bomb.com ! This pizza is amazing ! But the experience overall was awesome ! ! I looooove the customer service ! They have a great staff !<->1
I visited joyride for thr first time and i was blown away . The chicken tinga tacos were amazing and kate the bar tender provided such great service . I will definitely be making this one of my regular places .<->1
This is my favorite restaurant ! The mussels and the chicken trio are the best things on the menu ! ! !<->1
So very sad ... I returned here last night for some Cardinals action and dinner with the boy and my waitress totally botched my dreamy vegetarian sandwich concoction . Tear .<->2
Here in Phoenix for vacation . Came here after screwing up directions . Chicken burger was good and service quick .<->1
Great service and great food . Very clean and large space that supplies enough seating . One thing that annoys me is that they never have napkins . I could n't seem to find any .<->1
I order a burrito it was very good and the red hot salsa was so yummy also good customer service<->1
This place has always been great . The service is second to none and the food is phenomenal . Yes , the look is a bit different but it is the look of a traditional steak house . Great service .<->1
Endroit sympathique pour bruncher sur Côte des neiges . Le menu du midi n'est pas spécialement délicieux et surtout à oublier après 15h car au final il n'y a plus de soupe ni dessert .<->2
First time eating here and I have to stay the food was great and the service was awesome . Bartender was very nice<->1
Hops has a great staff . They are friendly , helpful , and always patient . The food is excellent . I definitely recommend this place .<->1
Two visits , no issues . Quieter than Boston Pizza , Jack Astors , good for a decent bite and a beer .<->1
Stopped for a quick bite to eat , with my daughter and friend . Nothing fancy . The service was good and the food was made to order . Very satisfied .<->1
Love this location . Been so many times . Always great . Love the boneless wings and original crust !<->1
Mother 's Day dinner , busy dinner . Excellent service and food . The sea bass was excellent , my husband had shrimp and scallops it was very delicious . The owner stopped by the table and we were were impressed .<->1
All I have to say is ... do n't waste your time ... try RETRO BAKERY instead ! ! !<->0
Love this place . Everything is always cooked to perfection . Order the Baked Goat Cheese to start !<->1
Hands down the best wings in town ! Crispy and delicious ! Pizza is great as well . Only gave 4 stars rather than 5 because they are a bit pricey . Decent dine in area for families equipped with arcade games .<->1
I ca n't give a better review of this place ... It is a must if you enjoy Pizza baked near a fire . If you do n't go , it 's your loss . Service is excellent , too .<->1
Absolute great service , when it comes to sandwiches they truly are one of the masters of genre<->1
Authentic Japanese Ramen place . Was recommended by a sushi chef in another restaurant . I came here twice during my short visit to Vegas .<->1
Great family run place giving fresh made bread and other hard to find specialty Italian itemsTHE JALAPENO CORN BREAD is amazing for all you spicy lovers ! ! !<->1
Good food and even better service . A bit cramped and a bit hard to find out where to wait in line , but do n't let that deter you from this great restaurant<->1
Might as well just do fast food it will have a lot less 50s replica junk on the walls cost less and wreck you just the same on the insides .<->0
What a great place . The drinks were flowing and the food was great . The people were even better !<->1
Waffles are good , would 've liked a side but they only give a circle of egg which looks like it was supposed to be on a sandwich ..<->2
Great happy hour , great food , great drinks ( specialty and their own craft brew ) , great service , and great atmosphere .<->1
We had the Brooklyn Bridge to go and the ricotta really makes it a delicious pizza . Unfortunately , the crust was a little doughy , possibly because of the ricotta , so I recommend you order it extra crispy . Otherwise a great pizza .<->1
Juice is great but wish they recycled their glass or at least sold discounted drinks if you leave the glass there so that they can disinfect and reuse it . But love this juice .<->1
We went here many years ago and had fond memories . So we went back last week and the quality had gone down . It was just too crowded and food was mediocre at best .<->0
The grilled tofu burrito is absolustely delicious . They soak the tofu in ranchero sauce and everything is perfectly balanced . Smokey flavor from the grill , fresh rice , beans are spiced to perfection along with the guac adding a layer of freshness .<->1
I got a sushi burrito and was very happy , a friend got a poke bowl , also very good . High quality , tasty and easy .<->1
loved the hot sandwiches ... yum ! and the apple cinnamon muffin was pretty good too .<->1
I celebrated my birthday at Cooperstown and had so much fun . The food is great and the atmosphere is awesome .<->1
Great pizza and wings , quick delivery time and friendly over the phone when ordering . Compared to dominos this place is 10 stars .<->1
I love the boba here . I wish they were nicer to my roommate haha . Her drink exploded and they did n't even re do her drink they just gave her a cup . i find it funny .<->1
The food was really good but the reason for 2 stars is : the hospitality of the staff was horrible to say the least . Do n't expect to be greeted properly when you arrive and also when you place the order .<->0
Amazing service and food . Went here with the family and my 84 year old grandpa who does n't eat much but he surprised us by eating his fair share . Will be back !<->1
I ordered chicken wings and they were definitely not as good as the ones I 've tried in other BP 's . The portion was small and not very tasty . However , the service was excellent .<->0
Once you get past the biscuits and salads , the menu selections are pretty bland . The seafood just does not taste fresh . Items well prepared , but many are heavily sauced or fried . Service was friendly and attentive .<->2
Another awesome meal . Good service , ambiance , food .<->1
Food was average . German beer was good . Friendly staff , an overall good experience . Nothing special but nothing bad . Definitely a good place to get some German food .<->2
I have n't found a good hot pot joint until now ! Everything was super flavourful and the staff was very attentive ! I will definitely be back !<->1
Great service , outstanding grilled cheese sandwich , tasty pizza - we 'll be back , for sure !<->1
Sushi was good , not great . The location is great and the hibachi grills are always fun for groups .<->2
Love this place . Order delivery from here through Eat 24 at least once a week . Nothing has ever been bad , and the spring rolls and thai iced tea are super delicious ! No complaints .<->1
Hidden gem - delicious food ! Steak and pommes frites , crab and toast appetizer and a beignet for dessert !<->1
A very nice local bakery and eatery . Breakfast is limited but all good . Lots of sandwiches and other choices . Really nice folks and top quality friendly service .<->1
Omg amazing everything no complaints the $ 360 bill was a bit overwhelming but worth it will be going back the steaks are amazing the macaroni and cheese was loved by my husband and I and the kids the drifter<->1
good food , staff very helpful and nice local spot .<->1
I always have amazing service and delicious food here ! Definitely recommend . I love their salsa and spinach feta chimi .<->1
Great service and delicious food . When you can , order that cordon bleu pan . Tried it and it was amazing . I am never unhappy walking away from her :)<->1
Nice patio with plenty of shade . Waited on immediately . Music is a bit loud for early afternoon . Great waitress .<->1
Not bad for Chinese food since we were not from the area & still need to explore the different restaurants in this part of Vegas<->2
Pricing is average for the area and meal , and the meals are very well done , so a great value . Service is fast , friendly , and professional .<->1
Mein absoluter Lieblingsitaliener , ich liebe die Pasta . Die Kellner sind sehr freundlich und das italienische Flair hüpft einen quasi an :-) Sehr zu empfehlen !<->1
Chris the barback ... he is AWESOME . SO friendly and personable . He would be an amazing bartender , just saying . Love this place ! ! ! P.s . If you do n't particularly care for IPAs , try the # 26 beer . Try it , and FALL IN LOVE . XOXOXOXO<->1
Really friendly service , great food and nice little cozy environment . The zeppoli 's are amazing !<->1
Came to this place with my family , I had the charcuterie and my daughter had the grilled salmon . awesome food and good costumer service . Shout out to Ivan and Sydney , they 're awesome !<->1
Augies has a great happy hour , with half price appetizers . I go here just for the southwestern chimi 's ... they are delicious !<->1
Great for lunch or dinner , we opt for takeout often and enjoy the vegetarian lettuce wraps , orange chicken and hot and sour soup . Friendly service and always fresh tasting .<->1
The best donuts ! ! Oh wow . We tried multiple flavors and the cinnamon crumb is amazing ! We will definitely be back !<->1
Super yummy chicken and waffles ! The spicy butter with the black berry maple syrup ! Great beer selection . Great pulled pork open face sandwich . It had a nice spice to it .<->1
Abated to try it so we did . As hungry as we were as we have n't ate anything ! The food was just ok . The restraint was very clean and the staff was nice .<->2
Delicious ! Got the Philly with out mushrooms . The everything came together so nicely and I hear they make their bread fresh how can you beat that ?<->1
Enjoyed the food and atmosphere of this little gem . Service was excellent and pricing was comparable for the food served . A great place to enjoy a quiet intimate lunch .<->1
Great place . Best indoor playset .<->1
Delicious food and great service ! I was a bit wary coming in after reading reviews but the service was awesome and we loved our meal .<->1
Wow I was pleasantly , and not so pleasantly , surprised by this burger joint . The price was high in my opinion but the burgers were really good .<->1
it was all fun and games until the orange chicken gave me food poisoning .<->0
Love their calamari ! Tender in , crispy out . Not overcooled like many others I 've had . I love the pad see ew , and pad Thai . I try getting new things but I always find myself returning to the see ew<->1
This is a cute little place to hang out . Their waffle is soooooo good . Also good milk tea too .<->1
Great massive burgers . Tots are always fresh ! About 10 - 12 a burger + side after you choose your toppings !<->2
No wait for a Friday lunch . Triple sausage thin crust with a side of parm cheese . Delicious ! Nice new location . Great service at the bar .<->1
This place is amazing . Incredible food , so authentic , everything cooked with fresh ingredients on site . Super friendly staff that feel like family . Nice drink selections . Really nice atmosphere to dine in . Love this place to death .<->1
Always come here when in Vegas . Yummy food but fill up on appetizers Could improve the Guacamole and if the rice was nt in chicken stock that would be great .<->1
Really good fried chicken , and the Pink Lemonade cocktails are out of this world .<->1
Very chic ! The to go coffee cups are beautiful and very cool ! The Expresso was very delicious . The wifi is not the best .<->1
Tried the shrimp fried rice . I think it 's safe to say I 'm never going back .<->0
Excellent breakfast place ! Food is delicious and not expensive at all . Great customer service ! They do n't take cards but they have an ATM available<->1
Amazing ! ! ! This was our first time here and we loved it ! ! We will definitely make this a regular stop<->1
The food here is okay , but nothing special . The food tastes okay , but it is expensive for what you get . My favorite part was the chips with salsa and bean dip , which are ironically free when you find in .<->2
Very peaceful and pleasant place ! The food is very fresh and delicious . We wanna come back and try more kinds in the future .<->1
Descent place for PHO after a long weekend of partying in Vegas . This is my go to spot on Sundays before leaving . This place is always packed ! Parking is not difficult .<->2
Solid place . Love the cheesecrisp and the flauta with machaca . It 's greasy but good . The last time.the waiter was this guy who seemed very cranky ... well whatever I did n't go to make friends<->1
Absolutely gorgeous ! My favorite coffee spot in Madison . The owner and staff are friendly and the coffee is really good . The coffee house has a nice vintage look . You open the door and you are right by the lake !<->1
Good food cooked well - loved the pepper jelly appetizer and the chicken with polenta . But the real star was the service - the hostess was wonderful and the waiter was very friendly and patient .<->1
Best boba I 've had near Henderson ! Glad they opened up @ this location . No need to go to rainbow or Chinatown for good boba .<->1
I had the chicken sorrentina . It was one of the chief specials of the night . It was fabulous . A nice little place with good Italian food at reasonable prices . Highly recommend .<->1
amazing home cooked and family owned !<->1
$ 1 slice nights on Tuesdays and 50 cent wings on Wednesdays ! Carmella 's is delish and cheap . Good beer specials too ! !<->1
Great place for a quick lunch ! They have quality sandwiches and daily specials that are always tasty . I love the location but the parking can be a bit tight during peak lunch times .<->1
The food was very good but in all honesty , a little pricey . The burgers and the fries are exactly like Steak and Shake but a little more expensive .<->1
Great stuff . The staff was awesome . Our little one was quite happy with her pancakes .<->1
Best won ton saimon soup ! Its the only thing I order when not feeling too hot ! That and some warm malasadas can cure even the worse flu !<->1
So glad I finally got to try this place . If you like taro order the taro coconut and make sure to add in chopped oreos . Do it and thank me after ! The earl grey and the mango were also good<->1
Grabbed take - out from this restaurant today for jang jang myun and fried dumplings ! Awesome portions and it really satisfied my cravings .<->1
Nice , clean , spacious - but otherwise no frills . Food is AWESOME and the place has a real mom and pop feel to it . We 'll be back soon !<->1
One of my favorite places to eat in Phoenix . Drum sticks and thighs are amazing ! The kool aid is delicious<->1
Beautiful views this is a great place to enjoy dinner with someone special or even a group of people . Also a great place to just go have drinks at . The views are breathtaking .<->1
I think I found my new fave pizza it was so good .. I had a build your own .. they even have so many variety of sauces to put on the pizza .. love ittt<->1
Never been to a worse Starbucks . Went to the drive thru and Kim was rude and unfriendly . She was more concerned with continuing the conversation with her coworker . No sense of urgency unlike the other locations I 've been to .<->0
My go to station with out fail . Friendly staff - best priced fuel - free air - clean always clean . I Pass 4 stations between this one and home - service does and will change patterns . I could stop closer to home but why , this one ai n't broke :)<->1
Love the food , and the freezer to grab meals to go . Most things here are also GF and they have them clearly labeled . Win win .<->1
I love this place ! ! When you walk in you instantly feel like home ! With friendly staff and wonderful decor it the place to go in Hudson , Oh for great coffee !<->1
Best burger I 've had in Phoenix in a long time . The staff was super friendly . Did n't really care for the ordering at the counter aspect but the bar staff and everyone else made up for that .<->1
Best place in Vegas and most of the country . Great prices . Can get busy as this is a local spot and small . Hidden in a strip mall . I always suggest this place ! !<->1
The place has a homely kind of atmosphere , which is nice . So I tried the cappuccino and a bagel . The bagel was good , the cappuccino was pretty rough . Ok tore lax but disappointing coffee .<->2
The pork tenderloin tips with peppers and onions was very good . Also the fried squash is the best that I have had . Field peas were flavored perfectly . Did not like the white rice .<->1
Not sure why all the negative reviews . Been to Manny 's many times and always leave happy and full . Food is awesome and service attentive especially when " papa " is there<->1
Good portion sizes but way too much on the menu . The bathroom was utterly disgusting and had fruit flies infested throughout the bathroom . Friendly waiter though !<->0
Great selection for home brewing . Very nice chick that runs it .<->1
Seriously awesome ! My husband and I came on a busy Sunday . Service was great , especially considering how packed the restaurant was . Food was wonderful . Drinks were full of booze . We will definitely be back !<->1
This is my first less than par review in my entire life . 40 minutes for aBill ? Unacceptable ... no apology , no comprise , thank you ... do n't come again please .<->0
Had Matcha Lattes ! ! ! ! Even though I am not into Harry Potter I did get the theme and they did a great job . Wish they had more outside seating though .<->1
Different owner , same menu ( a few tweaks ) and food was superb ! ! ! Moeen and Linda are veey hospitable . Still the best spot in Vegas .<->1
Al pastor with their salsa and pineapple chunks are so good ! We usually stop by here at least twice when in Vegas .<->1
The BEST bagels in the Valley ! ! Always on the lookout for great places to go with kids !<->1
We found this establishment by mistake but it turns out that we had one of the best meals during our trip to Las Vegas ! The service , the food , the ambience is what makes this local establishment a gem !<->1
Just a solid neighborhood pub . Good atmosphere . Good English tap list . Did n't eat anything . Impressive selection of scotch . Was full 2 pm on mon .<->1
Every time me and my family come here it 's a great experience the food is really good quality the bread is homemade I always customize my burger the sweet potato fries are always fresh everything here is really really good<->1
Fun place ! Very friendly staff , trivial pursuit cards on the tables , all outdoor seating , great ambiance . I had the grilled fish tacos , very good and inexpensive .<->1
Food 's decent albeit overpriced ( welcome to FRC ) . Service is mediocre . High staff turnover . Vibe is ok . But a bit pretentious<->0
Enjoyed the food and the atmosphere , decent wine list and good service . The one missing star is mostly due to the short menu , they could had a few menu choices without overdoing it .<->1
Good quality meats , great ambience , clean and friendly . Water is extra special ... which is really a Korean berry tea . It tastes so good ! We loved it . Hard choice between this place and Hobak .<->1
Good dim sum ! Very clean restaurant . Staff is really nice & attentive . Food is fresh & hot . Prices are decent & portions are good . We would definitely recommend this place to family and friends .<->1
This place is a wannabe casino and the security staff absolutely sucked ! Here , take my money and treat us like crap !<->0
Pan roast is the best way to go , good service Jill was great and I will return just because of that no wait from 430 to 10 am I loved it<->1
Always the best BBQ in CU . Chicken , ribs , catfish ... great sauces and fries . Come early - there 's usually a line .<->1
Sales are cheaper than walmart ! ! great staff , most of them are pretty friendly . Avoid going here during lunch hour , lots of construction workers are there and line ups are sometimes huge around their lunch break<->1
Had breakfast there 4 days in a row the absolute best ! Steven and the crew are beyond the best and food is cooked fresh and delicious . Ca n't say enough<->1
With a group of 13 service was not the best . As for BBQ ... Its just so so . Dried out food smothered with barbecue sauce . Pricey menu .<->0
Matt the bartender was fun . The place is nouveau but fun , " . The food is fabulous . Large portions !<->2
This restaurant was a great experience with great food . But , the the topper was out sweet , most accommodating waitress , Olivia . She MADE our experience . :-)<->1
We started our dinner with fresh PEI oysters and smoked trout hush puppies and a Pinot Gris from Prince Edward Island . The lamb merguez pasta was amazing ! The service was excellent . The staff was friendly and helpful .<->1
Amazing ! Great customer service and delicious food ! Definitely coming back again ! Their also going to expand their place and have a hookah lounge outside !<->1
Whoa ! I 've never gotten food this fast before EVER ! And it was really good too ! I 'll definitely be back . The menu has a variety of Mexican options many of which are not just your standard options . It was great :-)<->1
Friendly place with great food and music . Great rock on Friday and Saturday nights too .<->1
Found this by surprise , amazing gelato . Owner is super friendly and knowledgeable , and you can tell they truly care about their craft .<->1
Great Ramen . Not too salty . Downside is the wait and parking while plenty , could be hard to get a spot at peak times . Bathrooms are clean although a tad too dark .<->1
Clean fast and fresh . Ca n't argue with that . There is a new In and Out opening in the strip by the Flamingo , FYI<->1
Best burger joint in Arizona ! My friends got Pastrami burgers and I got a Lamberger . Try the poppers .<->1
Got the steak / chicken fajitas . They very tasty ! I loved the seasoning on the chicken . The caramelized onions were my favorite , though :) 1 lb was enough for 2 adults and 2 children .<->1
Excellent service and food ! Wellington was perfect - no sending this one back . Nice wine selection but a little pricy . The atmosphere could be a little more intimate for fine dining .<->1
This place has good food . The ambiance is ok and more like a dining place . So you get good food , and in good potions , but not a sit - chat place . I am a constant visitor<->1
Service was excellent , food was so delicious ! ! And you ca n't beat that view of Las Vegas . It 's such a good place to go to if you want to eat somewhere romantic !<->1
Excellent service and the food ... fabulous ! I had ribs , greens , and cole slaw . Yummy !<->1
Comparable to Schwartz in Montreal . Get the spicy homemade mustard and try Wolfe size .<->1
eww ... delicious burrito ... until i pulled a 12 inch long black hair from it ! gross . and could nt return it because we were already at another gate . normally super tasty burrito but not today .<->0
There was a MOTH in our salad that was catered to us . It was still alive while we were eating our salad . I have pictures to prove .<->0
Definitely a cool lounge in port credit , great to take a date . Great drinks .. especially the sangria jugs .<->1
Pretty good . Buffet a little toned down for American spice levels but otherwise good . Try their fresh made juices like pineapple - ginger . All you can eat great for dudes with active appetites .<->2
Great sandwiches .. alot better than any Subway or Quizno and they have real fresh brewed ice tea , not fountain head , pre - bagged yucky tea .. Sometimes it packs pretty quick during the week , so try to get there before 11 am ..<->1
Had a very good and different type of gyro sandwich . Included hummus , lettuce , tomatoes and cucumber . They were super friendly and quick too . Will definitely go back .<->1
Came from California for a short vacation , and came across Sushi 21 . Very pleasant service , and our group of seven people thought that the food was very tasty and fresh . Recommending this place .<->1
Besides the fact that this place has awesome interior design and an amazing and authentic menu , they have half liter Mexican Cokes . Nothing beats a Mexican Coke .<->1
Amazing ! Great , fresh food , and the kindest owners . Always clean and tidy , and affordable . I come from the other side of the city to eat here ! !<->1
Employees are always rude , tables are dirty , chicken is dry , wait is too long . Save yourself the time and drive down the street to PDQ . More sauce options and menu variety . Staff is very friendly .<->2
This place is a top notch Indian restaurant with five stars service . The food was coming a bit slow but we got complimentary naan for that . The food was great overall . We ordered several lamb dishes . They were delicious .<->1
Ok . They have a decent parfait . It 's 160calories and $ 1 . This works for me when I 'm on the go and forgot to pack something . Other than that , it 's Mickey D 's . This location has wi - fi .<->2
Parfait pour se réchauffer , chiller avec un bon café , une pâtisserie , de la bonne musique , et une deco tres sympa ! Leur nutellatte est excellent<->1
Probably the best pork belly I 've ever had . Perfect texture , fat ratio , etc . their ramen was good , cold noodles were good too .<->1
Estamos esperando el gran opening , será el 3/15 / 14 Te esperamos . Pon la fecha en tu agenda<->1
Cheap hole in the wall with tasty fish sandwiches and nice proprietors ? I dig it , big time .<->1
Will come here regularly to pick food . I had continuously two positive experiences including today with an african American employee - unfortunately I forgot his name . Employees like him are and example of good professionalism .<->1
It 's Wal - Mart . The greeter when I usually go is pretty awesome though , so an extra star for that . Dude has charisma . But still . It 's Wal - Mart .<->1
Wow , I was surprised how great this place was for being an " All You Can Eat " place . The sushi is very fresh and the rice was perfect . Loved the avocado salad . Service is also great .<->1
I wish that it was possible to rate in different categories . The food was great ... 4 stars . The ambience , not so much ... 2 stars .<->1
Amazing sushi ! Sat at the bar and he custom made rollsFor me based on what I love . So fresh & delish ! It 's right by my house . I go all the time .<->1
A rare gem that we happen to come across ! ! ! The food was amazing , service was awesome , might be my new favorite place ! ! !<->1
Love this place ! the food was sooo good ! especially the all you can eat fish fry on Fridays !<->1
Delicious comfort food ! We had the ox tail on rice / beans and jerked chicken on rice / bean with a side order of fried chicken . It was delicious and nothing compares . Looking for to try their fried dumplings .<->1
I love their crust and fresh veggies on the vegetarian pizza . Definitely worth checking out over the same old Pizzaville / hut / pizza etc<->1
Delicious and perfect . I love the burnt ends and the Georgia Peach sauce . Come early , get amazing food !<->1
First time at this restaurant , I was so pleasantly surprised ! We went for lunch , the owner Rhimie was our server . He was very friendly and helpful , explained all the dishes to us . Would definitely recommend this place ! Delicious ! ! !<->1
Love ordering from Roman Fountain ! ! The employees are always so nice ! Garlic Parmesan wings are the best I 've ever had !<->1
Good food and very fresh for the midwest . Lots of waiting though . I have n't been here in a year because there is usually a very long wait and they do n't allow reservations .<->1
Problem small space if you do n't speak Portuguese they ignore you and give your orders away !<->0
Enjoyed a breakfast of short rib and poached eggs . Others in our group had everything from breakfast burritos to classic poached eggs . No complaints by anyone . Conveniently located and great way to start our morning .<->1
Absolutely amazing ! ! ! I work nearby , and I try to get there before closing . On my days off , I come to get a sandwich and cookie !<->1
Love the owner . Besides the great food I come here for her . She treats everyone like family and genuinely cares about her guests . I almost always get the spring rolls and pho :)<->1
Saw all of the positive reviews on JustEat so I figured this place must be great ! The food is super bland and spicy without an attempt for real flavour<->0
Love this place ! Their coffee is amazing , and their food / baked items are top notch . I sat here for a couple hours working on some projects . What a lovely atmosphere . Great vegan options , so that 's always a win in my book !<->1
A trendy and modern place for a healthy lunch or a cup of coffee ! I had the Lima and it 's really yummy . Every ingredients went so well with one another . Service was quick and not crowded at 11 am on a weekday .<->1
First time here . Place is a bit small but great service and great food . Atmosphere is great with Japanese speaking staff .<->1
This place rocks ! ! Everything was incredible , and they have food for vegans and their non - vegan friends ! The tree of life pita was definitely a good first time choice . And they give you samples :)<->1
Great prices , and pretty darn good thai food . Not the best thai but close to it . Clean place and nice people ! Will be back for sure ! ! !<->1
A MUST ! Great coffee and breakfast sandwiches , order the vanilla latte and sausage egg and cheese sandwhich<->1
Truly my favorite wing spot . Just the right crispiness and sauce . ATL flavored are the best . I wish they would deliver also<->1
Great food , but service is lacking . Waitress seemed overwhelmed & almost impossible to get a drink from the bar .<->1
Best Indian in Madison so far and I have tried 4 . Why ? They have more selection and it 's delicious . You get a basket of fresh toasted buttery naan and get more if you ask .<->1
It was really salty food and waiting time was more than 45 minutes ? . There was no customer service at all . No water service , and they did n't bother to ask how was the food . It was n't pleasant experience .<->0
Love this spot .. My new favorite juice bar .. Amazing staff , awesome tasty juices , and great smoothies .. I 'd recommend this place to all my friend ..<->1
This place was amazing . A little expensive but no regrets because the food was absolutely delicious . The mac & cheese was mouth watering .<->1
I absolutely love this place and to be honest this maybe better than Starbucks . And WAAYYYY better than Dutch Bros .<->1
I love the food here and the chef Tipp . I 've been here couple times and they are amazing . Good service and people are very nice and friendly .<->1
This location is a bit smaller than the rest , but it is just as good . The staff is very friendly and of course lots of tv 's to watch all the games .<->1
The shepherd 's pie was excellent and came with a nice side salad . The service was fast and friendly .<->1
Really delicious falafel and shawarma here ! SO GOOD , you can add the fillings you want and it 's made to order . Chicken and beef are good . Really hits the spot . The service is also super friendly too .<->1
get the sweet and pungent shrimp it is hands down the best menu item . my only regret is that there is n't another location for this business near Gilbert / Queen Creek where I live because I would eat there daily .<->1
Just found hair in the pizza . Eww ! Never again from this location will I order food , blah !<->0
Great subs ! They are made well . Came in in Father 's Day and it was buy one , get one ! The staff is pretty friendly too .<->1
Great wings and service ! Loud and lots of drunk people , but the amazing wings totally make up for it !<->1
They have this hot sauce that will numb your mouth but still gives your meat that right amount of spicy to kick it up a notch .<->1
Amazing ! Order the cheese board it will knock your socks off ! The atmosphere is incredible and service spectacular . It 's a must visit in Cleveland .<->1
Soft shell crab was amazing ! Fries and salad excellent . Lovely space , and lovely people . I will be going back again and again !<->1
Would n't take my pre - order for the next business day . What 's the point of calling ahead<->0
I love the food but it seriously ridiculous when you order take out you have to pay extra to get the sides that usually come for free with the menu item . And they do n't tell you prior to ordering .<->2
My husband and I dined here last weekend . The restaurant is very nice , service and steaks were great . We tried the filet mignon and dry aged New York strip .<->1
We just ordered food for a soccer team dinner catering . Manager Neil was very helpful and the girls loved the food<->1
Sunday morning breakfast special . They have real hashbrown potatoes . Try them , Alyson is a fantastic waitress and there is not a wait .<->1
Bland is the best description of food taste I can post and remain civil . Long service wait for food . Better choices are available in a restaurant - rich area of west - Glendale / Peoria .<->0
Very below average wing spot . Their wing sauces are very plain and feels like they bought it from a grocery store . I do n't recommend to go here for wings .<->0
Always a good stop before or after First Friday . They usually have a live band , which is entertaining . Try the Cadillac Margarita with Patron . Yuuuum .<->1
I just finally attended a " Bring your LP " night . That was awesome and they had some good beers to choose from .<->1
Gracias sue por todo ! ! ! This place is great ! And our waitress sue was the best ! ! ! I 'm definitely coming back ! ! !<->1
I like the people here but it 's a tiny place , if you 're looking to sit and do some work or have a meeting you 're better off trying the one by UNCC .<->2
Super old school high end GEM in an old run down strip corner If you can call it that . Impeccable service . Very comfortable<->1
First time customer . Ordered the works deep dish ! Very good ! Will be coming back definitely . I 'm normally a grimaldi 's , settebello 's , verrazano 's or Due Forni pizza eater but Howies is definitely in my top five now . Never heard of them before<->1
Absolutely amazing food . And the food came super fast . Had the falafel tacos and the dragon fries . No regrets .<->1
I had n't been here in 5 years . I gave it another try . EWW ! It was gross . We went at a busy time . Lots people so food was coming out fresh and I did n't want any of it . Just Do n't ...<->0
Great ! Used to make fresh brick oven pizzas and these are fantastic . For what you pay and receive I ca n't say one bad thing , great cheese , crust , and toppings<->1
Very relaxing place to enjoy an evening with friends . The wine is good and the atmosphere is amazing . Their pizza is really good , much better than local pizza shops .<->1
Love the food , tons of variety to pick from the staff is always helpful . Clears dishes quickly .<->1
Best customer service I 've ever experienced in a sandwich shop and great sandwiches to boot . Also , every sandwich you buy also provides one for someone across the globe .<->1
So so good , this has got to be the best cold treat to combat a hot Las Vegas day . The ice cream in the bottom is something I highly recommend .<->1
Super Sache : Wir haben hier eine Obsthof - Besichtigung gemacht : Sympathisch , kompetent , ausführlich und jeder Zeit auf Fragen eingehend . Hat mir einmal mehr vor Augen geführt , daß hinter Obst viel mehr als der Name z . B . eines Apfels steckt . Sehr zu empfehlen .<->1
It 's my go - to neighbourhood sushi place . Yes , there are better places with more exotic and interesting sushi . But it 's consistent , reliable , and tasty . Fish is always fresh . Ca n't beat the price either . Service is friendly .<->1
I 'm from Pennsylvania and I know this place is n't authentic , but it 's pretty good . It 's a bit dirty , but the staff is very good and the food is decent .<->2
Great food & very friendly service . The vegetarian momos and veggie thali were delicious !<->1
I love Peameal Bacon and it 's made fresh here . Ca n't beat it for service . I drive from Brampton to buy my meat .<->1
Great food , portions could be smaller . A little pricey for Middleton . Would try somewhere else next time but would also not hesitate to return .<->1
Friend took me tonight ... had the tacos which were good . Very popular place to be tonight . The line was to the door .<->1
Flavourful , heavy , and filling ! Comparable to burritos in Texas . The fries are also good .<->1
The cook and owner is the sweetest grandmother - esque Itallian women you will ever meet ! The food is AMAZING . Wonderful food at a very reasonable price .<->1
Excellent gyro pitas , great price . If you 're in Northeast Phoenix , you 're just doing yourself a disservice by not trying this place out . Just go get some , you wo n't be disappointed .<->1
The bouillabaisse was the star of the show . One of the best I 'd ever had . I 'd come again if I were in Montreal again .<->1
Amazing atmosphere . Our waiter Alexander was very knowledgeable and friendly . The food was off the charts . I recommend the tomato heirloom salad and any one of the pasta dishes . We will be back for more ! ! !<->1
Great place , not Gourmet but fun and they have cider . I love it in the summer when it is all open .<->1
Bought a drink did n't taste good asked for another one did n't want to exchange it . Not like they did n't get my money to begin with . Not good customer service .<->0
Great patio ! Huge selection of beer . Only place that they fall short ( along with just about every brewery ) is that they do n't serve food .<->1
Just ran in the store , thinking I was going to get a quick milkshake . I was informed they were out of milk . The irony is the supermarket is right behind the store . Really ?<->0
Wow , I went through the drive thru thinking it would be another greasy burger . WRONG ... its was a dry crispy flatted out peice of salty road kill . Try the Chicago dog Yummy !<->0
View is amazing , food is mediocre , drink selection is decent , and service is okay . Nothing great , but honestly , on a summer afternoon , having a beer on the outdoor deck overlooking the city - - you 'll forget all that .<->2
I had never had frozen custard ! It was very yummy , and the young guy was really helpful . He let us try what we wanted and was very informative .<->1
Great tasting kebab and the portion was huge . Very decent for the price you get a lot<->1
Food average , processed . Bartenders terrible security awful all around bad experience would not recommend to no one now there cooking off a food trailer and taking it inside the worst by far<->0
Had breakfast here , food was great , well priced , and good service ! Loved the eggs benedict .<->1
Very.good breakfast . we ordered the croissant and other pastries and the waffle . Food was good Not fantastic . I would say the prices reflects more the ambiance because it was a very beautiful place to go have breakfast .<->2
Great place to go for your party needs ! This placed is locally owned . Everyone who has helped me out has been very friendly . They are also very accommodating with their party rentals too . Thanks Party Planet !<->1
I lined up for an hour and got the Thai Me Up ... it was super ultra delicious and rich in taste . It did not disappoint at all . Though the line was quite long ... I probably would n't line up for an hour again .<->1
This Hinkle and unassuming place serves and very solid breakfast . Is it sublime ? No is the best breakfast ? No but it is good meal for a great price . The owners and workers are friendly .<->1
the milk tea is very average quality . the egg bubble waffle is a bit overcooked .<->2
One of my favorite places to grab a cheese steak sub ! Really have n't had anything that was n't good there !<->1
I 've been to Lola 's several times now and in my book they deserve 5 stars . Great latte 's , even if you substitute soy milk for moo . Free wifi and nice atmosphere to meet clients .<->1
Just opened near my house and the service is awesome ! Frappuccinos all day everyday :D<->1
We enjoyed every aspect of our dinner . The pasta was delicious with generous portions and quality ingredients . The staff were also very nice and attentive . We will be be back again and again !<->1
Affordable , compact but sufficient place right close to ikea ( ~ 1 mile ) . Perfect if you are vegan / veg . For the meat lovers , give it a try !<->1
always loving it . i have low service expectations for a fast food place but you guys go above and beyond on this<->1
This place feels like home to me . My most memorable moments in life have happened here . Birthdays , marriage proposal and wedding party .<->1
I 've been to it a few times over the years , and I 've never had a major issue with this store . I tried the new Chicken Bacon Wrap and it was tasty . If in the area and hungry , I would return .<->2
The worst Mexican food I 've ever had , I 'm never going back , the menudo was terrible no flavor at all , the torras were made with bread from days ago . Wasted money<->0
Excellent NY style pizza . Have a slice , you 'll be convinced . Hands down best pizza in Mississauga . Prices are reasonable and they deliver . I hope this place stays around for a long long time . A + +<->1
The food and service are excellent . We loved the fresh pasta dishes , especially their pasta pomodoro with shrimp . My daughter and I also liked their baked clams . Highly recommend ! !<->1
Excellent Bacon Bloody Mary 's ! Casey made a batch of these savory cocktails . The bacon was smoked and a bit .<->1
Not a fan of chain pizza in general but sometimes it somehow happens that other people make you eat this garbage food . And pizza pizza is not a great pizza . Just another mediocre pizza among how many other mediocre pizzas ?<->0
Beautiful dining room . Excellant service . Food very good . Excellant bread . Excellant gelato .<->1
Good food and great service . Chicken soup was especially tasty . Pad Thai was a generous portion , lettuce wraps were n't the best but certainly passable . Will visit again .<->1
Ca n't wait to go back . My friend took me there for lunch yesterday and it was terrific ! I had the catfish ph boy - mmmm . Beans and rice were great as well .<->1
This place was delicious . The food was delivered hot and fresh . This was the best Chinese food I have had in a very long time .<->1
I have eaten at many Hard Rock Cafes . But the Texan burger here truly was incredible . I would photographed its magnificence ... but I could n't put it down . Everyone enjoyed their food and the view .<->1
Had steak sandwich , a little too fatty for me . Kind of expensive . Small place , but fun . Rest of meal was good to go . Will definitely go back .<->1
Goat Meat , Elk Meat , Buffalo Burger ... you can find exotics here . The store is kept clean ( no bad smell ) , and the customer service was excellent . Will return :)<->1
As you can expect with Arribas . Lots of free chips and bean dip . Generous portions . Prices are fair . Not the fanciest restaurant but the ambiance is nice and the waiter was helpful . Left full and happy .<->1
Cute little French Cafe . Great Service , Friendly Staff , Delicious Crepes , Coffee and Egg Dishes !<->1
Love this place , but right now it is currently closed up and on Facebook they say they will open soon in a new location , but i ca nt find out where or when !<->1
Ughh ! ! I am done ordering from this Papa John 's only because I have received pizza twice that was not cooked fully . The pizza was mushy like you were basically eating dough ! ! Lol ! !<->0
Calzone is undercooked and plain . Would never eat if I did n't just pay $ 40 for six measly boneless wings , a soggy calzone , and dessert . What a joke .<->0
Everything was amazing . From the Escargot to the steak frites , everything was delicious ! ! ! You actually feel like you 're in Europe . ( But , really ) Definitely try it here ! They have seating at the bar if you ca n't get a reservation !<->1
This place is really good , however I think a bit overpriced on the food options , I do love the beer selection . the vibe there is ok , I would return again .<->2
Not impressed with the Pork Belly bowl , at all . Only Monta Raman will satisfy that craving . The Kake Udon and creamy mushroom Udon were very good according to my husband and son , though .<->2
We have been shopping there for years and we live in downtown Toronto . The service is impeccable and the beef and the free range turkey is amazing . Thank you Tom especially for making our dinners successful . Kemeel and Madge<->1
I tried everything on the menu that had a must try next to it . From the poki to the cod to the green tea and Thai crepes amazing ! Friendly service and cozy ambiance . A must try fusion restaurant .<->1
Spectacular food , kind - but - unobtrusive service , Easy parking , no wait and great drinks . 5 stars definitely .<->1
Best Persian kebabs in town ! The atmosphere and hospitality reminded me of the middle east . The food was also 100 % authentic ! So fresh and delicious !<->1
Very cool , delicious , organic / local options , original and fun ... Plus service from a bunch of cute , down to earth guys = Awesome in my book . I 'll definitely be back !<->1
Like having a backyard - grilled burger . It 's good but I would n't go out of my way to eat here .<->2
Unique Asian fusion food mostly in a Korean style . Eaten here many times and never ordered something I did n't like .<->1
WOW . So many options that I really did n't know what to order . Ended w chicken pad Thai and a lamb skewer . Really great flavors with a nice kick at the end . Tastes really fresh . Also pretty large portion .<->1
Our custom cakes turned out beautiful , although I would have liked for the designer to contact me about filling more flowers on the big cake .<->1
Really good gyro ! THe overall lunch had character with a more personal season .<->1
Oh wow this place is stunning ! ! ! The service was fantastic and friendly . The management was really friendly and walked around . and the food was exceptional . The burger is really hot and spicy and I loved it ! ! !<->1
It 's a cute spot , but the coffee beans were burnt , which gave my large coffee the same scorched taste . I would rather try one of the specialty drinks next time .<->2
AMAZING ! ! Seriously the best cheesesteak I 've ever had . And the employees are always super nice and happy .<->1
Good offering of produce , frozen goods , spices , random stuff . It 's a large store , offering meat and fish too . Could be cleaner but is about par for your Chinese store .<->1
Great service & food was on point . The staff is extremely friendly & they are hiring if anyone is interested .<->1
Great course with awesome deals ! Went in for lunch after golf and had a GOOD burger . Definitely recommend for value and fun .<->1
I like Del Taco for fast food . I always get the same taco which is the Del . Pretty good for a good price . Not all the stores are clean though<->1
Better coffee than frikkin Starbucks . Support the local business y' all . Great service , smiley faces , and a great place to meet and make new friends .<->1
Great happy hour or even great place to come with the family . Fun environment , definitely coming back . Food and service were awesome !<->1
We really enjoyed the coffee and food here . She really enjoyed the decaf , I enjoyed the regular . We also enjoyed the falafel wrap they had . We had breakfast there four days in a row ( took sandwiches from other locations in as well ) .<->1
Delicious went in for individual sweets . Did have a small selection , could have been since we went late roughly 3 pm . Seems better for bigger orders such as cake s . Pricey , but what I did get was delicious .<->1
Our first visit there recommended by James brodfuehrer Great service and great food Huge portions be sure to visit this place on an empty tummy So worth it<->1
Pretty decent as far as fast food sushi goes .<->2
we went for my sisters birthday , they hooked us up with a large enough table to seat the family , even with last minute reservations . food was good , service was good . had a great time .<->1
Service at La Perla was very poor and ridiculous when charging for a small bowl of chips . Food was marginal at best and very small quantity<->0
This place is great ! Been here 3 times in two weeks . The food is good , service is friendly . Would definitely recommend .<->1
Ok , the Reuben was a bit charred but Italian sub and the Nachos were gone before I could get a picture of them .<->2
Interesting take on hot dogs . I highly recommend the Colombian Dog , it 's not how I would usually outfit my hot dog , but the combination of ingredients ( chorizo , pineapple , mozzarella , chips , and sauce ) makes for a delicious treat .<->1
I do n't understand the negative reviews . I got a caprese sandwich with bacon and thought it was delicious . Service was friendly and fast and the food was fresh .<->1
I understand that " good , real food takes time " but over an hour for a half sandwich and cup of soup ? That 's ridiculous . Apparently the long wait time is normal - so keep that in mind .<->0
Great place for lunch if you want something quick and easy . All - American food and speedy service . I love the jumbo burger and fries !<->1
Great environments ! Only downside is service is a bit slow !<->1
Some of the best Vietnamese food in the Valley . Their fried spring rolls are perfectly crisp . Their Pho is fantastic , too . They just expanded the size of their place so my guess is that business is good . :)<->1
It 's ok , I guess . I 've been here couples of times , but nothing ever fascinates me . Standard service , standard food .<->2
Definitely one of my favorite places for breakfast / brunch . Love the brewmosa as a morning cocktail and just tried the chile verde benny with soyrizo and oh my gosh . ca n't wait to come back .<->1
Our server was very sweet . We went for the $ 10 endless apps and when I did n't like how one of them was made , they fixed it immediately and without fuss . Great atmosphere .<->1
ill just drive another 5 minutes to Tacos El Gordo next time i want tacos .<->0
? ? ? BLT ? ? ? ? ? ? Steakhouse ? ? ? ? ? Las Vegas ? ? ? Bally 's Las Vegas Hotel ? ? ?<->1
Called to get some info let the phone ring for almost 5 minutes no pick up what kind of super store is this<->0
Best spot for Ramen in Vegas ! Spicy miso ramen , fried rice , and Kirin on draft . Ca n't beat it !<->1
Wow ! A tremendous meal , great staff , and a very romantic setting ! This ones a keeper ! We will be back !<->1
Took my wife here for 25th Anniversary dinner . Everything was great ! Next time I 'm going to have the filet , my wife had it and it was wonderful .<->1
Good but small waffles . I would like a full size waffle , cover the whole waffle iron with that batter ...<->2
Best geek restaurant in Vegas I 've been thus far , their moussaka is the closest to the one you 'd get in Greece !<->1
Service was very friendly , but we waited 19 minutes for one turkey sub and one steak and cheese sub during lunch . I do nt know if we could return for lunch due to unreliable wait times ...<->0
Sunday on the patio people watching . Bottle of Champagne and OJ for $ 9.95 . Beats a Mimosa for $ 7 . Wish they had more patio seating , but we were able to grab one .<->1
Ordered the buffalo chicken pizza through their online ordering system . Very easy & user friendly . Pizza arrived on time if not a little bit early ! The pizza was very yummy . I would definitely recommend Bomonti Pizza to others<->1
Yummy food , clean restaurant , nice atmosphere ! The beef kabob and falafel are very good . Prices are reasonable . Recommend coming here for some authentic and delicious Israeli food !<->1
The food is delicious , and the staff is friendly . I am drooling , from just thinking about the food . My favourite dish to order is Mi Dac Biet ( dry ) .<->1
Really good place great food and drinks at bar and really nice hostess - I would look for Brittany to assist you<->1
This place Jjambbong is awesome place i ve came from LA but this is way better place so please come check out and jjambbong is very spicy so be careful but I love all food here<->1
Food is good . Service is a little short on people and they forgot a lot of things . But still a great family establishment .<->1
The quality ... and everything varies here . Can ' t guarantee clean floors . Sandwiches are different every time I get one . Service is mostly positive . Also , there 's a big hump in the floor - see if you can find it !<->2
The Sushi here is really great - which I find surprising for a grocery store . The sushi quality is much higher than AJ 's and even some restaurants .<->1
As good as they get ... outside of Vienna in the 80 ' s . Portland can wait .<->1
Went to Boulders this afternoon for Happy Hour . The bar is a cool location and atmosphere with a great beer selection . I look forward to going back and trying more of there menu and drinks .<->1
I saw this gem my last time in vegas ! They have one near me in Norcal ! But i tried it here first because of the occasion , it was delicious ! Customer service was bad though kind of rude ! But oh well .<->1
Okay . So every time I call or stop by to this location . The employees are amazing ! When I order they are patient and helpful . Alway on top of their shit .<->1
The only place to get a fix of that lovely concoction . Friendly staff every visit & close to the office so got to love that .<->1
Wonderful Sushi , good prices . Their other meals are excellent as well . Been going there since it opened in late 1997 . Have celebrated numerous birthdays , anniversaries , etc . there and have the Polaroids on the wall to prove it .<->1
The " west sider " sandwich is the BOMB ! Great spot ; the girl working the cash register is super hot , and the sandwich chef is a true culinary artist .<->1
100 % authentique patisserie ... so happy to have stumbled upon ! ca nt wait to try more !<->1
The food is always fresh and delicious . The service is outstanding . Everyone who works there is very nice . The breakfast is great and they have daily specials - baked cod , baked chicken , wonderful soups and salad bar .<->1
This was pretty horridConcomitant with hotel downgrade to Double Tree . Greasy rewarmed second rate . Totally to be avoided . Help Mother ! ! !<->0
Really cool craft beer bar , 50 taps & awesome pizza . Cooler full of craft beer bottles , and a friendly staff :)<->1
Good service , and they had decaf coffee ready ( not instant or lattes only like most MTL places ) ; toast was excellent , but the eggs , potatoes , and pancake were just " ok " . " Fruit " was laughable , more like garnish .<->0
Very nice place to have a nice , still pricey , cup of coffee but hey you pay for the nice crowd too . A great place .<->1
Popular spot on rainbow with the most consistent quality in food and service . My family and I frequent this spot , and hopefully , you will too ! Short Ribs and Thin Sliced beef are my go - to plates !<->1
The service is on point and the gellato was delicious . Worth going back . I like the peanut butter topping .<->1
Everyone was so wonderful and friendly ! I would most definitely recommend this place ! If you 're looking to try something new , Green Life Cafe is the place to go !<->1
I 've been here and ordered the ribs . They 're pretty good . Nothing really stand out . The red velvet cake is pretty good though .<->2
Standard diner with easy access . Good size portions , but a little overpriced . Omelettes are all priced over $ 18 .<->0
Omg sooooo good ! ! ! That was the best cannoli I ever had ! I wish I order two of them ! The pizza what amazing too !<->1
A birthday celebration night in a nice French restaurant in Downtown core . Good service , Great wine selections and very good quality meat ! ! Quite expensive but it is worth the price .. I 'm lovin ' it ! !<->1
Been here a few times and the food is always on point . Atmosphere is casual and chill but the food is better than most fine dining on the strip . The truffle bone marrow is a must ! ! !<->1
Terrible . Waited forever in line for a hot dog , which ended up being completely burnt .<->0
Awesome . Food was good , prices were good , service was good , you get what you pay for . This is a great local places for around for a long time that you should not forget about .<->1
Very disappointed in the Chicken Marsala . My husband had the Veal and both lacked flavor . Tiramisu - not yummy ! We will continue to look for a good , Italian restaurant .<->0
Had a groupon for the yard drinks . Get the strawberry and banana one . Tastes JUST like a smoothie . Not 5 stars since you can find a better deal at Fat Tuesday 's .<->1
Got a gift card for here and was overwellmed by all the topping choices ! gret yogurt too . There could be more lemony though<->1
It does n't get much better then this ! The food the people everything over the top great<->1
Honestly fair . Just fair . Came here with family and they were equally not impressed . The so - called famous meatballs I heard of we 're nothing compared to other Italian restaurants . Food is bland and lacks simple salt and pepper .<->2
Two words : mango salsa . That is my entire review .<->1
Yardhouse is great . Huge selection of beers . The pizza is good . Staff is friendly at the bar . I always get the house ipa . It 's good . :)<->1
We had the best experience here ! Come for happy hour ! Great prices and good food ! Our waiter Dylan was the best ! Definitely ask for him ! So much fun !<->1
General Tso 's tofu and vegetable fried rice were prepared fast and hot . The quality and taste of the food was very good .<->1
Not my kind of Chinese food ... very blend .<->2
Great happy hour ! I would recommend the tuna over the shrimp but plenty of options for all<->1
I LOVE THIS PIZZA ! ! ! honestly everything about the food is really good . My Bf and I found this place on Yelp and its one of my favorites .<->1
Wait for 1hr on sushi roll ! You can get it anywhere not worth it . Too noisey dor sushi place also . You can get me just once<->0
I 've been here twice in the past two weeks and have had no issues with their service even when there is a significant amount of customers . The food and the beer make this place worth any wait you incur .<->1
The service was good , prices were a little high and the food was n't anything special . Had the ribs and brisket , not much smoke flavor just taste the sauce . Had better BBQ .<->0
A Hawaiian chain store in Vegas ! - liquor , wine , champagne - food - snacks - assorted drinks - makeup - toiletries - basic medicine - souvenirsThe place to go for almost all your needs !<->1
Chicken & Waffles need I say more .. wow ! ! Great atmosphere , friendly service and great food . Allow some time since its busy most of the time . Try their veggie plate and Lolo 's # 3 you wo n't be disappointed .<->1
This Starbucks was fast . Cashier was not so friendly ! Try their cake pops they are the best !<->2
I enjoyed it . I went there on a Wednesday night , about 5 p . m . Very good service , nice decor , reasonably priced , I would return on future trips to the ares .<->1
Thrifty 's ice cream and fresh homemade cookies ; what 's not to love ? So glad this location opened and I no longer have to drive across town .<->1
2nd time visiting thus steak house Great customer service , delicious and exceptional food , highly recommend<->1
5 stars for Pedro at the Furnace bar . Constantly gives 5star service to everyone . I see it happen regularly<->1
Only got carry out but the girls taking my order were fabulous and fast . She even took my order out to show me that everything was there . The food was great as usual , and hot .<->1
J'ai appris l'existence de Romados le lendemain de l'incendie en janvier 2013 et depuis ce temps j'avais hâte dy a ? ler . C'est fait et ils ont dépassé mes attentes . Meilleur poulet grillé et meilleures frites en ville .<->1
First time , and totally satisfied ! Delicious and great service ! Got the Rebel - a classic with strawberries , bananas , Nutella , vanilla ice cream , and whip cream . Not bland . Scrumptious !<->1
Like Raj mentioned , nothing special about this location , however , I was greeted promptly and my drink was prepared in record time . When I 'm in the area , I 'll be back !<->2
Great sandwiches and sides . Decent value and reasonably fast . Gets a bit cold in the winter though .<->1
The pizza here is great , very thin crust fresh ingredients , not greasy at all .<->1
Very busy restaurant but worth the wait . Mini hot pots are delicious . Service is very good . Sizzling hot plates . Prices are on the higher end . Give it a try - new fusion<->1
the breakfast here is so good ! i recommend coming here for breakfast . everyone working here is friendly . our server Eishley was amazing . he always checked on us and was very nice about everything . would come back ! !<->1
This place is worth checking out ! The bread is the best part ! I had the eggplant parm with spaghetti and my fiancé had the homemade pasta with shrimp . Everything was great and we will def be back .<->1
Fabulous French toast ! The portion sizes are more than enough to fill you up . Friendly and welcoming staff but most importantly , very clean ! Viri is the lovely lady who helped us . Her smile and attitude will brome back !<->1
Really good fresh healthy proportions of fish . Wide all you can eat menuNice selection of beers / sakeFriendly staff / quick service<->1
Best food ever and it 's quick you can even watch them make it i had the chocolate and strawberry one<->1
Has become my FAVORITE neighborhood cafe . GREAT salads ! The new shrimp and grits are the BEST I ever had . The Lime Tarte is like tasting heaven ! ! The servers are great and know the menu well . The chefs .. the BEST !<->1
Ordered a $ 5 mango smoothie . Can tell fresh fruit was not used . Alright . Prob wo n't return . Outdoor seating In the back with no view .<->2
Bartender service is supposed to be fast and attentive . At the bar and he decided to read the paper instead of pay attention to anyone . Blah .<->2
We ordered cottage cheese + fruits , omelette . Good food but nothing spectacular . Service was friendly , nice atmosphere with Mediterranean music played in the background . Problem : the seating is cozy with other patrons .<->1
Ryder is always providing exceptional service . Definitely have him make ya a milkshake some time . 10/10 will visit again because the staff is awesome and always serve with a smile ! Tell ya friends !<->1
Hush puppies are a great start . I have never got anything here I did nt like , but small bbq sandwich and side carr are my regulars . Good service and great feel when you visit . I love this place !<->1
Small unassuming pub in DTW . Efficient friendly service . Food look looked fantastic . Nothing fancy , salads , sammies fried fair and cheap drinks , .<->2
Me and my husband always buy here after doing groceries at Wal - Mart . They have the best customer service and the store is very clean . I love their poutine so much . !<->1
Amazing atmosphere but the food was not good . They really need to re think the menu and food . A beautiful setting like that needs way better food , bigger portions and can even charge more .<->2
Fresh squeezed lemon juice ! What more could you ask for than the fresh ingredients that Tea Space has to offer . I also really enjoy the art & positive vibe .<->1
Good food A bit pricey and the service is unhelpful and makes mistakes often very loud<->1
I read these reviews about crab corner being expensive . Wrong ! Got 14 med for $ 25 . ( after tax ) If you can find great fresh sweet blue crabs for under $ 1.78 let me know ! Crab corner I heart you !<->1
The customer service was great . The shop was very cute . The coffee was delicious . However , I was not impressed with the food . I had a breakfast sandwich with turkey sausage and it leave me with a huge tummy ache .<->0
Yummy fish tacos ! However after eating the 2 that came in my order I was still wanting more . Tasty but not filling enough .<->1
Amazing food . The Mac and cheese was incredible - great combination of flavors . It has truffle oil , but this was not overpowering . Nice selection of local beers . Great service . Family - run business .<->1
Fancy fancy ! It was a little much for my taste , but it 's definitely nice for a nice meal out . I prefer more laid back establishments . :-)<->2
Food is fine , not the best bbq and a bit pricey<->2
This place was EXCEPTIONAL ! . They allowed for a customized order and make their own country fried steak ! They quickly remedied a mistake and their food was sensational ! Definitely coming back !<->1
Lots of vegetarian options ! Really enjoyed the Caipirinha mixed drink ! Will be a return customer .<->1
This place is great . There is a relaxed feel in the restaurant with cozy booths and a good drink menu . A nice variety of food too . Good service , must go back soon .<->1
Huge line up for waxy over priced soft serve ice cream ... they do look cool but ... really ? ? ?<->0
Love this place . The cupcakes , cookies , and mcarons are amazing . They also are known donating to non profits allowing those who would never get the chance to eat such amazing treats .<->1
The falafel us pretty good . A little too much tzaki , but still good . The fries 6 to very well with it , though . The deserts are fantastic !<->1
Great flavors , awesome toppings and THE nicest staff in vegas ! They make you feel so comfortable and are super pleasant ! Great ace to take your sweetie for some sweets !<->1
Went this evening and it was sooooo good . We did a flight and it was nicely priced . Each cider had its own unique flavor but none were too sweet or overpowering . Staff was very friendly and helpful .<->1
OMG ! What a selection of gelato ... Had to taste almost everything . Service was great , costs very reasonable , and the in house made gelato delicious . Will definitely be back !<->1
Great service , great food , great prices . It was an awesome place to wander into for breakfast .<->1
Best Fish Sandwich ! Our hiking group , 16 of us stormed into this wonderful place after a six miles hike at Clifty fall state park .<->1
Good , very good . Gravy is yum . Seats are a tad uncomfortable and I felt bad because there was only 2 servers but for the most part , pretty delicious .<->1
I have n't found the people here to be as friendly at other locations ... but the coffee is amazing and that 's what I go for !<->2
My wife and I really liked this place . It was clean and the food was really good . It tastes fresh . We ordered pork fried rice and orange chicken .<->1
Great place to hang out and work . I love that they have coffee and cocktails available ! :)<->1
Always fast , fresh subs . The guys working are so friendly too !<->1
Fun environment , good bartenders , and they play good music . I have n't had any food there , but the drink selection is massive !<->1
Love this place ! Have been eating here for over a year at their north location and it 's always been so delicious ! Their lunch special is the best . Would recommend anyone to come here !<->1
All you can eat BBQ in Vegas ! Good quality meat with many choices . The service was perfect even though it was busy . Our server Kevin was nice and was fast with our orders . Highly recommend<->1
Love at first bite ! The dumplings are the best I have had ... succulent , juicy and packed with delicious flavor ! I had not had scallion pancakes before tonight ... they are savory and make you long for more !<->1
As both a baker and an italian , this is hands down one of my most favorite everything ! ! ! I frequently drive 1.5 hrs to get pastry , pizza , flatbread .<->1
Main dishes were good and plentiful ... chicken makhani was exquisite , chilli chicken was very well prepared . .. appetizers were ok , mixed grill was expensive for relatively small portion .. good experience overall ..<->1
By far , the best fro - yo in the Valley . The flavors taste natural and not overly sweet . My favorite flavors are the green tea ( real matcha powder ) , original , and pomegranate - blueberry .<->1
Very delicious food and relaxing atmosphere . You can tell they are not a chain or mass produce their food , it tastes fresh .<->1
So overrated and pretty lousy food . Greasy spoon at its best . Better choices very close .<->0
Had a really nice time with my wife and friends here last week . Good place . Clean restrooms . Will definitely come back .<->1
We moved away from here about two years ago but this is still one of our favourite stores . It is clean , the food is fresh and they have an awesome Sushi variety .<->1
Great food and atmosphere ! I love that they offer gluten and dairy free pizzas and paninis . Their staff is always friendly and courteous . Nice place for a middle of the road price - point .<->1
OMG I love this place . Amazing value , excellent food , fresh and healthy ! Sometimes ordering is a little hectic and confusing but it 's well worth it . Portions are HUGE ! I think I 'm addicted !<->1
A must when visiting Vegas . Delicious Island Favorite is the BEST ! ! ! Portuguese Sausage rice and eggs ! ! Worth the 10hour drive . Amanda our waitress was super friendly and did n't miss a thing ! ! !<->1
Best coffee in the states ! ! Highly recommend it . The also have a very good selection of tea .<->1
Spotty service but the music was good . Very good beer selection .<->2
Just had a couple glasses of wine - very helpful on suggestions ! Friendly Service ! Nice appetizers . I 'll Be Back !<->1
Randomly chose this place to eat and it was excellent . The service was great , the food was yummy , awesome atmosphere , chill cool place with a nice bar . Definitely will return .<->1
Got Brussels sprout salad and iron ! And it was great love the freshness ! The cider is amazing ! He atmosphere is great here ! Perfect spot for hanging out with friends and having dinner<->1
I gained 5 lbs . eating here over the summer . The drawbacks are that they are often busy and you have to wait for a while to be seated . Their corn is delicioso !<->1
A little hole in the wall with great subs and wings . Sub bread was fresh sesame seed bun . Wings with perfect amount of sauce . Nice casual lunch spot .<->1
This is probably my favorite burger place of all time . It is a great place for burgers . Really great staff . I been coming here for a long time . Highly recommend . The place itself has great decor .<->1
This place is great ! ! ! Fresh toppings , ice cold yogurt . Reasonably priced , cheaper then the competition in the area . We 've been here several times now and will continue coming . A great addition to Laveen .<->1
Not a great location , everything was old looking and tasting . Maybe because this is right by the mall ? Either way , take the drive and visit another location .<->0
Great bar . Service was amazing . Food was amazing . I watched some rude customer yell at a bartender that gave him over the top service . I 'd recommend this bar , their food , their drinks and their great bartenders to anybody .<->1
The food is very delicious ? and all the food matieral is fresh . The side dishes are tasky . They come with a larger amount than their counterparts in LA . We like it ? ? ?<->1
Wonderful family - owned restaurant with the best Italian food in Las Vegas .<->1
Should n't have taken out the self - checkout . Now I spend more time in line than shopping .<->0
This Breakfast place is phenomenal ! I got the Corned Beef Hash and eggs and it was amazing . I would recommend this place to everyone . Definitely worth every penny spent here .<->1
I love this place . The owners are the nicest people , the food is fantastic . I eat the daily special almost once a week . This is a phoenix favorite !<->1
Sitting at the bar seats , we heart from the chef , this restaurant has already been there for 30 years . Quiet environment , good quality , and very kind chef !<->1
The Mojitos were decent , but the bar food left much to be desired . It 's a nice spot to wait for your flight , but you wo n't be impressed by the food even when considering the low airport standards .<->0
Great service , wonderful food and drinks , extensive menu ! Loved the experience here . Aside , from the wait ( we had reservations ) the food was phenomenal . I would come back !<->1
Came for lunch today and had a great dining experience ! Ambiance and presentation of food was nice . We then took a tour of the hotel Found : Re . Worth exploring ! !<->1
The vegetable quality is now improved but the amount of chicken , beef and shrimp they 're adding is decreasing . Please get a scale and weigh out the meat portions to be fair to your customers .<->2
Wings are great , have never had a bad meal here . However , service is beyond slow always !<->2
This restaurant is a true oasis of flavor in a desert of bland food . The ambiance , the decor , the staff and of course the food is amazing . I highly recommend to all my plant based brethren .<->1
I got the passion fruit and strawberry slush with mango popping boba . It was delicious and comparable with Boba Tea at the mall . I will definitely be coming back .<->1
One of the coolest 24 hour cafes . Enjoy a monkey mocha while appreciating the funky art and chatting with the most interesting people . Cool , chill , and delicious .<->1
I 've eaten here many times , and I 've found that their breakfasts are great any time of the day . It 's worth paying the extra dollar or two to get an omelette for dinner !<->1
This is a regular breakfast stop for us . Food is always great and the staff is fantastic . For a great breakfast at a great price , this place is the best in the area .<->1
Very delicious Egyptian cuisine . Very fresh and refreshing during these hot summer days in Vegas .<->1
Pretty good Vietnamese food with a wide selection so you 're not limited to pho . Really great service !<->1
Really good coffee and pastries . Love their pumpkin scone and coconut creme . The ambience was really casual and relaxing , makes you want to stay and just hang out .<->1
The food and the service was excellent the best mofongo I had in years and the prices are reasonable but expect lot of food think about sharing I had surruyitos and bacalaito my complements to the chefs love the food<->1
Happy hour menu is fantastic . Nate the bartender was outstanding went 2 nights in a row :) excellent .. Salmon carpaccio and pizza were excellent and the tiramisu the best<->1
They have a huge variety of sodas available , but their food is sub par . Kind of greasy and overpriced .<->0
Love these guys . Always have a great recommendation ! They will point you towards sales items . Friendly and knowledgeable . Customer service from everyone ( owner included ) is top notch . Growler setup is great . I would go out of my way to shop here .<->1
Petit marché fort agréable , propriétaire et services impéccables<->1
I 've just tried the best war wonton soup ! Perfect for this cold weather . Tasty and generous portion .<->1
I had lunch there last sunday me and my wife had a great time good service great food ca nt wait to go back there again<->1
The auto - generated email saying that the owner would contact me was a complete lie . No call . No email . No anything . Well , it 's cool ... There are other choices out there .<->0
Other then 45 min wait the food was worth it . Wait staff was very courteous as well ... will definitely be in my rotation of breakfast spots on the weekends<->1
Good food . My gfs favsies . Love your all you can eat sushi lunch and dinner . Yummy food and really big sushi rolls . Sometimes almost to much ha but it 's very good and always good .<->1
Went to the Bankers Hall location . Had a drip coffee . My friend got a latte and said it was the best he has had .<->1
I always like coming here . The service is consistently good . The staff and servers are very nice , fast , and good . The food it 's great tasty and the portions are good . Great place for family and friends .<->1
I am just visiting Toronto but would probably come here often if I lived here . Good food . Good service . Good price .<->1
Une belle surprise . On m'avait tellement dit que c'était coûteux . Au contraire , abordable , bon service , bonne bière . J'y retourne .<->1
Great date night dinner ! ! We had the scallops and the cowboy ribeye - amazing ! ! ! We loved our server and the ambience , a must try for the Charlotte area !<->1
Food was phenomenal ! Had their signature burger and truffle fries ! I 'll be back . Service was great ! Food was hot and fresh !<->1
Fried calamari appetizer is delicious followed by the chicken with roasted garlic pizza soooo good . They also have a white Pino Noir that 's quite nice and a nice beer selection . Great atmosphere and comfortable seating .<->1
As always wonderful Mongolian barbecue . Much better than Gingiss Grill and much more reasonably priced . Dinner all you can eat is 1399 and their ingredients are fresh .<->1
Vietnamese food is one of my absolute favorites . I always get the Bun Cha Gio ( Vermicelli Noodle Salad Bowl with Grilled Chicken and Egg Rolls ) and Spring Rolls .<->1
Way over priced sandwich ! The normal size for a double price . Good enough to pay double ? NO ! Never going back there .<->0
Great food , service and atmosphere . I would definitely recommend this restaurant . I would not bring the kids though and make sure you love seasoned meat . The salad bar is also great .<->1
Great place for classic homemade Italian food ! Fast and friendly , perfect for families or date night .<->1
Lou makes THEE BEST Chicago Beef around . THRILLED to be here on a Saturday afternoon .<->1
Manager invited me back with friends to show how good they normally . Great service and he picked up the tab . Food was very good .<->1
From out of town and this is a great pool hall . Good food , great tables ( tight ) , and good people .<->1
This place is now closed ... about 6 mi the earlier than I thought it would in my first review .<->0
overall pretty good .. applewood bacon & cheddar burger was so bomb .. they use fresh ground beef so do n't be scared 2 order it a little red if u like it that way ... service was fast and always attentive ..<->1
Excellent pizza ! I drive from the west side of town to pick it up . Reminds me of the pizzerias I grew up with back in Staten Island .<->1
Some of the best deli sandwiches I 've ever had . The owners make most everything from scratch and remember your name . Not to mention the potato salad is amazing .<->1
Je ne m'attendais pas à grand chose ... Bonne surprise . Le staff est sympathique , et les variétés de poutine surprenantes et alléchantes . J'ai adoré la " Poutineville " , au b  uf braisé . Miam .<->1
This location is closed . Do n't know if it will reopen , seemed out of place for the vibe it was trying to capture .<->0
Their menu items are pretty interesting & unique ! The braised pork mantou was my favourite . The bun itself had a light sweet taste to it . And Ricky was super nice . I 'll definitely be back !<->1
I wo n't go anywhere else for Chinese .<->1
Overall it was disappointing . Noodles were soggy and nothing was seasoned corecctly . Asked gor very spicy and there was no heat . Gets 2 stars becaus the fried rice and eggrolls are great .<->0
I 've been coming here for about 5 years now and they never fails at satisfying my cravings . If you want to try an authentic French pastries , this is it<->1
I like the atmosphere and the super hero theme . The bar is nice and there 's always sports on .<->1
We sat at the bar , very nice cocktails and service was excellent . The food was delicious as well and the bartenders had good suggestions for both the food and the drinks . We will return to Sinatra next time in Vegas .<->1
Omg the best sandwiches ever ! ! ! Night crew is the bomb love Shannon Chad Liz and the newest member Brahms great customer service ! ! !<->1
This is a must do if in Vegas . Service : outstanding . Period ! Food : lobster and filetMignon delectable . dessert : creme brûlée unbelievableExciting feature : wine girl flying through the air to retrieve wine from the tower ! Everyone here is wonderful and I will be back !<->1
Baba ganush was sweet - oddly . Kabobs mixed plate was good ! Kind of over priced for the portion size .<->2
Food is amazing as well as the service ! ! Cute sit down pizza place , we loved it and will definitely be back<->1
The coffee is STRONG ! As it should be . The bakery items are also really tasty -- even the vegan ones ;)<->1
Been here twice now . Everything we 've tried so far on the menu is good . Huge portions . Service is great too . One of our favorite breakfast place now .<->1
Super friendly and helpful staff ! Had a veggie smoothie - deee - lish ! Would go out of my way again to try the other morsels that look quite delectable ! !<->1
I give Thomas Street a 5 star rating because it is one of my favorite bars and I 've been coming in for years ! I love it .<->1
Went to Lagos on a friday night and were seated right away . The food was decent , the waitress was helpful . but the service was slow .<->2
coffee was okay , staff is quite rude . No one greeted me as I walked in , proceeded to ignore me while I was waiting at the register , specifically Caitlin . Be happy people !<->2
Really Good , Came in For The Buffet the cook came to us to tell us what kind of pizza we want .. overall Great !<->1
Excellent service , very attentive staff and the food is excellent . I come here at least 3 times a month and they never fail to impress . This is the spot where my girlfriend and I call " our place " .<->1
Absolutely amazing service . Outdoor seating and great eats . The craft beer is designed very well . They label the ABV 's and supply full tastings before you purchase . I recommend this to anyone visiting<->1
Went through the drive the bitch could n't here me , took 2 minutes trying to order a " filet - o - fish and an extra 6 minutes to order apple slices this terrible<->0
The dosas here were really good . I tried the cheese dosa . I really like all the condiments that came with the dosa . The atmosphere was nice as well . I would definitely go again .<->1
Really good pizza here . I guess I did n't like that you could n't create your own , so I am docking you a star . I am not a picky eater , but let me make my own pizza !<->1
Fast delivery service . Quick eat Crispy ginger beef came burnt as shit and they did n't slice up the beef .<->2
This was such a pleasant surprise . Normally , I pass on any restaurant that has a rating lower than 4 stars . Food was good and more than plentiful . Service was excellent and we will surely be back .<->1
amazing food and always quick and courteous servers . try the happy hour !<->1
Poor value for the quantity and quality of food . Save your money and eat at a decent sit down .<->0
Best customer service ever ! The owner is always there to greet you and make sure that you have a great experience ! The food is incredible and the atmosphere is even better ! My family LOVES this place ! !<->1
Really amazing food ! I have been looking for a great Mediterranean place , and really stumbled upon this place by chance ! Super super delicious ! Also , family run by the nicest people !<->1
This is always my birthday dinner stop ! the prime rib is outstanding ! ! this time I got the turf & surf ! service is what you would expect from a steak house of this caliber . prompt , friendly and ready with the drinks ! ! !<->1
The food was fast and delicious . I had the boneless goat and it was hot and sizzling . Lots of parking spaces and lunchtime is n't too busy . The ordering steps are easy and there are nice people there .<->1
Eaten here many times and enjoyed most of there food . Just wish the prices would come down some and they use different types of Frys .<->1
this bar is awesome ! Great location and fair price ! I ordered a pulled pork sandwich it comes w salad ! Did n't try the wine bc I 'm nonalcoholic haha . Will come back next time ?<->1
This is an exceptional place . Fresh fish done to perfection in a casual chill atmosphere . John the owner and Heather the hostess / barkeep are friendly and knowledgeable . Local beers , ciders and wines . A very memorable meal .<->1
Last time I was here was back in 93 , has n't changed much and neither has the fish n chips ... outstanding as usual . I grew in the UK and familiar with pubs , this feels like home .<->1
My wife and i both love this place . We wind up ordering way too much food because there are so many menu items we enjoy .<->1
Wow great place ! great sandwich and soup combo meals , excellent selection of deserts . Prices are pretty good , like some one else commented like panera but better . Also a great assortment of smoothies .<->1
Heiney 's is one of our favorites . The mid - week menu is great , the catfish " fish fry " on Friday is spectacular , and the fresh - shucked oysters are a rare delicacy - - and less expensive than those sold in restaurants back east !<->1
Love this place ! ! Delicious boba smoothies and awesome ramen . I personally love the dumpling ramen , just the right amount of spice too . Try a taro almond smoothie with boba if your looking for a new delicious combo .<->1
Picked up 2 gyros to go , the price is good , tastes great ... kinda light on the sauce , but that seems to be the way it is ...<->1
Nothing to write home about . The seating booths are really uncomfortable . The Rosemary fries were too oily .<->2
We have had breakfast and lunch while visiting Las Vegas here . The food was absolutely fabulous , the price was reasonable and I have never seen a restaurant so clean .<->1
My new fav . spot on the way out of Vegas . Hello crab legs ! Beer . Mimosas . and FLAN !<->1
Very good addition to town service is professional so far the food we had is very good , layout is very well thought out .<->1
Very good ! Place was slammed so we ended up grabbing seat at the bar . Service was still fairly quick and the bartenders were working like machines . The tacos are Delicious ! Good blends of seasoning and ingredients .<->1
The cookies are so delicious ! Confetti wap was my favorite . Delicious . So good . I was just laying in bed wanting a cookie and my dreams were answered . They were fresh , warm , and so satisfying !<->1
This is my new favorite boba shop . The workers are nice & I literally got my boba in less than a minute after I ordered . I 'm def gon na be a regular here<->1
Just ordered some food here the salad is bomb ! I like the food no delivery fee is great too . Definitely will come back<->1
Was there last night and had a pasta dish . The tomato sauce is exquisite . When I mentioned it to the waiter he told us it was made on site . My appreciation to the chef .<->1
1 . My Carne Asada was grilled , hard tortilla , dry , just nasty . 2 . I paid 5.50 for it ! :/ 3 . Salsa did n't help much<->0
The restaurant decor is pretty basic . No Vegas wow factor . The food is mediocre , the presentation is ok . I 'm always down to support the mom & pop shops .<->2
So dissapointed , Dilly 's Deli is officially closed , as of December 23 . Permanently , according to the sign on the door !<->0
The best part of the food is the toast . EVERYTHING was soaked in oil . I would not come back The waitress was as sweet as pie . She was the best part of meal<->0
Delicious place ! My go - to for Thai since my reg place has disappointed me time after time . Gaati is consistently tasty and their quality is on point .<->1
Awesome place ! Good pizza and the girls there helped me with my asthma attack . # savedmylifeonadrunknight - thx .<->1
Totally worth eating at ... I had the Mac - n - cheese burger I will say it pays to be a total rewards member . 5 minute wait instead of 45 ... WINNER<->1
Very glad to have found this place . Great food . Everything was fresh and delicious . We drove 9 miles to get here to try it out and are very glad we did . Highly recommended !<->1
Had a really decent breakfast here .. price was typical . On my list of places to go for breakfast if I 'm in the beaches in the morning .<->1
A nice fast food style restaurant with good food . I had the Kung Pow Chicken and really enjoyed it .<->1
Friendly , helpful , & quick , but overpriced . You 're definitely paying a premium for a mild convenience , considering the DMV has a kiosk for renewals now .<->2
Nice place ! Found this place after a recommendation from another cafe . Has a rustic and modern feel . Food is good .<->1
It 's very nice to have a place that focuses only on dipping . Very cute and definitely a delicious treat .<->1
I have yet to try other options but between this and Aloha , pretty much same . Descent . I need to try Roy 's , although I am sure it is going to be much pricier !<->2
I am from back east , these are HANDS DOWN the best bagels I have tasted in AZ .<->1
I love their turkey and provolone cold sub ! Delicious with pickles added .<->1
Got the salmon sandwich with the soup of the day - watermelon and strawberry soup - - SO GOOD . 100 % recommend to others and will come back !<->1
Food is amazing and the outdoor seating is perfect . Try the Brussel sprouts , they are the best in Charlotte .<->1
The food not bad but horrible service . Waiter almost forced a goodbye from us when we were disappointed by her service .<->0
Awesome placeEmployees know their jobs and are Very pleasant Great place for coffeeMuch better than SB plus it 's " local " Thank you<->1
Worst sushi of my life . I 'm pretty sure the fish was expired , the rice was soggy , the sauce was awful .<->0
Even when this place is n't quite on their ' A ' game , it 's still tremendous . Hats off to Pomo and all the other great pizza places showing up in the Valley .<->1
Friendly staff . Decent food spoiled with NYC Tao I guess there is just no place like home<->2
Typical diner food . Cute setup . The atmosphere is nice . Fast . If you 're looking for a quick , hearty meal , stop here . However , it 's not fancy .<->2
ox tail fries were amazing , customer service was great , the meat was cooked on point for a medium well done<->1
Very welcoming when you first come in . The staff was very attenitive and our drinks were never empty . Food was great as always . Get the Hawaiian pork belly !<->1
Love their ice cream ! The staffs are super friendly and they are open til 11 pm every day .<->1
Stopped by for a beer and snack . We sat outside on the back deck . Nice beer list . Our waitress helped us with our selections . The nachos were delicious . Glad we went .<->1
Great food friendly service , they deliverLarge selection of chicago food . Appetizer options are amazing ..<->1
Delicious food great customer service and hip atmosphere . Most definitely coming back . Also will request lindsey as our waitress again !<->1
Arguably the best tempura in the city , fresh ingredients and plenty of seats . The service is prompt and efficient , if a little cold .<->1
Good , inexpensive , fast lunch service . Authentic and basic menu .<->1
Very good fluffy donuts . I will be back . Beware they close when they sell out though !<->1
Great service , excellent beer , and the food is hard to beat ! Recommended !<->1
I could n't be more of a fan of Mitchell 's . Fresh , vibrant flavors from great , local ingredients . Anyone who says this place is n't the best ice cream is entitled to their opinion , however wrong it may be .<->1
I really liked Sugar Creek Brewing Company , like really liked it . They have fresh , complex # beer options , a warm , inviting rustic indoor and outdoor space , and their bartenders are lovely , as was the owner I met !<->1
My husband loves the food , however , I do n't care for it . Service is great but something is missing .<->0
Love the coconut shrimp tacos ! Gerson is the waiter you want to ask for ! Bean and cheese dip is a must too !<->1
Good food and good value ! It 's the place that my husband and I usually go for pizza . We 've also ordered and had it delivered . It 's always arrived quicker than they had stated on the phone .<->1
It really does n't get better than this ! Great beer sampler , excellent Mac and cheese , the fish sandwich is delicious and your ca n't go wrong with the Cajun chicken pasta !<->1
food is so good best jampong everQuick service and nice ambiance . Happy hour deals are amazinggggggggg<->1
The best Asian food buffet I 've ever had here in Arizona . Amazing fresh quality and preparation . . So much to choose from . My boyfriend and I really love this place . 5 stars all the way !<->1
This place is simply the best ! ! Great servers , great food , great management ! ! ! Their prices are really not bad either !<->1
Un vrai régal saisonnier ! La cuisine est pleine de saveur et justifie le prix . Les légumes sont savoureux , le service agréable , rapide et avec le sourire ! C'est une petite mais bonne adresse .<->1
Great service from Liam and good food ! A nice place for some good food and live entertainment . Liam took special care to avoid my onion allergy .<->1
Hey Avon Walmart ! How about stocking your shelves in the grocery section ! Really ? ! Stock your shelves ! I 'm so done with Walmart !<->0
I had the pad thai , spicy basil chicken , and cream cheese wontons . It was SOOOO good and they delivered within the estimated delivery time . They even allow you to choose your desired spiciness level :)<->1
Love it ! They even visited my classroom to teach about health food . Gave away coupons .<->1
Lovely ! ! Awesome third wave style coffee and the space is so cute . Tucked away and was a nice way to get out of the freezing temperatures<->1
Great location and setup . Drinks are solid , food is decent for bar food but could be better<->1
Sea Bass is amazing ... the white tuna sashimi melts in your mouth . Next time I am in Cleveland this is going to be on my list of places to come back to .<->1
I had 2 client lunches here and lucky enough to have Christina as my server both times - she 's amazing ! She provided incredible service , wonderful attitude and was on top of it ! The food and atmosphere is great too ! Highly recommend !<->1
I have to say that this is one of the first times that I enjoyed being next to a walkway . The waitress Rachael was amazing . And the food is awesome .<->1
Great Dogs ! Arizona Dog with Guac is killer ! I had the Pittsburgher with Ham and cheese . It is Fantastic . The guy who runs the place is very friendly and actually came over and sat with us for a minute .<->1
Very high quality food at a reasonable price ... bison and kobe beef burgers with ypur own personal picks , who could ask for more<->1
Great flavors ! ! Gluten free options too . LOVE it ! ! We will be back to try more of the menu for sure .<->1
Servers do not pay attention when called upon . And hostess has been having a 10 minute conversation with another employee . To top it all off they got my order wrong .<->0
I miss you sooooo much Monta . The ramen here in Florida is like well ... terrible . I would do just about anything to sip your broth , slurp your noodles , the pork , the egg , the everything ... me sad .<->1
Excellent coffee . Super nice owners and staff . The vinyl spinning on the turntable is a nice surprise . It 's busy but worth the wait for delicious food and locally roasted coffee from Pilot .<->1
Exceptional food and service . Pleasantly surprised at what a great dinner we were served . Our waiter guided our selection , very helpful for newbies .<->1
Very nice HK style diner . Not too big , a bit outdated decor , but the noodle ( vermicelli ) was amazing ! ! ! Definitely will come back and this might replaced congee queen as my fav HK diner .<->1
Absolutely terrific at weekday lunch . No hesitation . But terribly inconsistent on weekends and evenings . Been burned twice with substandard meals , barely close to what was served on weekdays .<->1
Fresh and good - will go back again . They describe the spice accurately - loved the green curry and loved the papaya salad . You know how sometimes the fish sauce can be a little overwhelming ? not here .<->1
Great selection of yogurt and toppings . For me , it is worth the drive out of the way<->1
Delicious and fresh ice cream mixed with fresh fruit and many toppings . Put 's Cold Stone to shame ! Definitely going back for round 2 .<->1
Great people and food ! and wine of course<->1
the best denny 's in the area ! staff is always friendly & quick --- food always comes out hot & pretty fast . this is the only denny 's i go to !<->1
These cinnamon rolls are great . Great variety of specialties or you can build your own .<->1
I love this place ! my favorite is black sesame with almond cookie and condensed milk .<->1
The food here is awesome ! Good sized portions for the money and they cook it more like a home made meal . I 'll be back .<->1
Good ambience . The coffee is overpriced . The quality is not that great compared to its price . The chocolate muse was not fresh , not well made and it was 7.50 $ . Better try dessert in other place .<->0
Really fresh and tasty food . The mint tea is awesome too . A nice addition to College and definitely worth a try .<->1
I love Greek and I thought the prices were a little high for what I got . The falafel was n't as good other places whose prices were cheaper for the side . Probably wo n't come back here again<->2
Great local store , the prepared food , soups and sandwiches in the back are amazing . The chicken pot pies have a cult following in the ' hood . They 're that good ! Staff are all super friendly and there 's great produce !<->1
This place is amazing ! My husband and I go here all the time . Their orange chicken and spring rolls can not be beat , staff is very friendly and they deliver ! I hope they stay around a long long time !<->1
The food is always good . ... However the service is not and the owner never shows customer service instead he makes you feel like you 're an inconvenience to him<->0
Fresh lemonade tastes like a mojito , sooo delicious . Egg and rice noodle combo is so good , lots of food so bring an apatite . Pad Thai is amazing<->1
tacos al pastor are the best ! ! ! make sure you ask for pineapple and the tiny tostadas<->1
Reducing one star due to the constantly shrinking size of the tacos ! The price is still the same , but what used to be a huge taco is now near street taco size .<->2
Thank you Lou Malnati's - for coming to Arizona and feeding us the BEST PIZZA EVER ! ! ! # AMAZINGPIZZA<->1
I ve been to most of the so called great fish and chips restaurants in town this was the best . Friendly service and really good fish , ca n't go wrong with the catfish .<->1
Love it good environment . Variety of choices . Food taste very good ! The dessert there is amazing !<->1
The donuts are as good as any Dunkin Donut . Unfortunately , they tend run out product early and they close very early . This is located in a gas station , so there is really no place to sit down .<->0
Great food ! ! ! Service hit or miss but considering the small space it is understandable overall one of my new go to places ! !<->1
I love diners ! We used to eat here when we lived up there . The only thing I 've eaten here were burgers and breakfast . I enjoyed both .<->2
Ordered the Hawaiian BBQ sandwich . It was pretty good , but nothing to rave about . I 'd eat here again .<->1
Definitively a downtown place to go after work - the food is very great ! And the margaritas are very good shared with the girlfriends ( a pichet obviously ) Take the fish taco , the nachos , quesedillas MIAM MIAM MIAM<->1
It 's your standard Hawaiian food with the exception of the garlic chicken . It 's the best thing here and the portions are huge . Also the kalbi is decent but just a little too fatty .<->1
Kabuki is great . When I am traveling between Vegas and Cali , I love to stop at a Kabuki 's for sushi . I get the same quality of service not matter which location I go to . I am a big fan<->1
Just the highly quality treats and food in an upscale neighbourhood . You can tell they have good quality chefs who know what they 're doing and pay attention to detail . Love their pastry selection thumbs way up !<->1
Food was nice but waiting time was long . Definitely a good place to go at leisure . The desert was great . Crepes were nice .<->1
Small portions for the money , plates look plain and without any garnish . A wanna be upscale restaurant should not compromise on quality or presentation . Having flies around brunch buffet only topped the experience .<->0
Shrimp and grits , menu says with bacon , but arrived with sausage . The sausage was very spicy and took away the savory feel I would have liked with the bacon .<->0
The hog burger was the best burger I 've ever had , Parmesan truffle fries were delicious but definitely need to be shared . Shake 4 was also good , would recommend this place to anyone<->1
Cozy place with good seating . Comfort foods . Hainan chicken rice is yummy and comparable with other nearby places , and you can get a hearty Japanese curry as well .<->1
Pistachio milkshake was great . Meat and burgers were not . I would recommend to go to smash or fat burger instead<->2
My family and I came here for the first time and none of us liked the food , it did n't taste fresh and it had no flavor . Yogis grill is much better .<->0
Britany is an angel , excellent service . Great patio , great vibes . chips and salsa are always good<->1
Ok . Not bad . Had better . Hamburger 2 buns , lettuce , tomato , n Thousand island dressing , home fries . It was fine .<->2
Had a nice lunch with 3 kids . Fresh fish , attentive service and reasonably priced . Kids really liked the chicken teriyaki which they tend to be picky about . Thumbs up .<->1
Ca n't believe it . Stood in line for seemed like 10 mins . The lady , two people infront of me , ordered a family meal . Then the clever guy yells , " Okay , we are out of breast " . So I turned around and walked out .<->0
The Wings are Bomb.com ! A lot of favors ! Great service ! Very chill spot ! Staff is friendly !<->1
Ate there once with family . So noisy in there you ca n't even hear yourself chew . Everyone talking , they need to do something about the acoustics . The food was good<->2
I 've had both their Gyro and Grilled Chix Salad - both really good and definitely recommend .<->1
Delicious ! Best donuts in Vegas , definitely ! Even though the place is completely run down , I could care less , the donuts are the best !<->1
The burger are very tasty and very different . chicken burgers are having very juicy chicken . Definitely my fav<->1
Great food , lil quaint place n the employees are super friendly . I would recommend it to everyone<->1
La poutine est gigantesque et délicieuse , normalement je partage pas ma nourriture mais dans ce cas ci j'ai été obligée ! Je ne me plains pas par contre , c'était divin !<->1
Great great food ! ! ! Wings are excellent as is everything else including service ! Highly recommend this place .<->1
The famous Chef Thomas Chefthomas.recipes was at Carnegie Mellon dropping off son for freshman orientation and they have a great new cafe . Did n't exist in my day . Great soup and tea . Excellent service . College campuses have improved greatly .<->1
The baked Italian sandwich was basically a hot pocket in quality except my crust was burnt . Decent but not worth the price . Great service though .<->2
Love this location ... Jarrett is awesome ! ! ! He makes sure we are taken care An happy ! !<->1
Fabulous food . Fresh takes on some classics . Give it a go , you wo n't be disappointed .<->1
Ok Ewhhhh . Unfriendly staff . Food tastes like out of a can . Over priced . Need I say more wo n't be back DUH ! ! !<->0
Overall was disappointed with food quality and waiter service . Was seated right next to entrance / exit of the kitchen which made dining uncomfortable also .<->0
I had the poutine with bacon , onions , and chorizo . Food was delicious and came out quickly . The mojito I ordered was probably the best I 've ever had .<->1
fourth time trying cinos . everytime i go in there there s somthing new ! this time was the garlic ketchup and ghost pepper ketchup . BIG FAN ! they have milkshakes also i will try them next time .<->1
Good Greek restaurant in Pickering . Has a lot of flavor and portions are huge . Nothing spectacular but very tasty<->1
The pizza was really good , got the regular cheese pizza . Seating is limited and it 's a very popular joint ! I would make sure you get someone to save you a spot .<->1
I got the PB Lover bowl , the cashier lady was very helpful for my first time there . Prices are decent , you get a lot for a regular size . It was pretty good bowl . You also get a stamp card :)<->1
worst japanese food . place smells and its old . terrible and horrible . staff are not friendly<->0
Great " Old Vegas " restaurant . A total dice with excellent food and service . We loved it !<->1
Love this place ! Great food , large portions and friendly service . Ask for the senior discount .<->1
Quick and helpful service . Good food . My lemon chicken was good . My wife 's teriyaki chicken even better . " This tastes like asian food I grew up with in Seattle " was high praise from my wife .<->1
Amazing dinner last night , sat by the kitchen , Really enjoyed the chefs . Chef Mark and Christian created an amazing meal . Fried goat cheese appetizer , spicy meatball app , seabass entrée , and skirt steak were simply outstanding .<->1
The most bland food ever . Delivering was moderate ... but to wait that long for super bland food sucks .<->0
Very disappointing . Food was mediocre , bland , salad bar very limited ( not even any tomatoes ! ) . Incredibly overpriced : payed a Vegas strip price for a Freemont street quality buffet .<->0
Terrible , terrible service . 15 minutes to take a drink order , and after 20 more minutes , nobody has come back . Coffee , water and Ice Tea ... really ?<->0
Love this place , food is legit and the people are super chill ! Love the way the huge burgers taste !<->1
Based solely on the Pizza , this place is delicious . For less than $ 15 the pizza was delicious and filling , I would definitely go there for that again .<->1
This is excellent food . Friendly staff , great atmosphere and even better food and it 's appropriately priced .<->1
We ordered 6 small dishes . Chicken feet and shrimp dumpling are great ! The pork bun is good too . They do n't serve dessert like tart on weekdays . Overall good .<->2
Great hookah ! ! Great service ! ! I will continually come back here . Better than any other hookah lounge in the valley . I would recommend this to all my friends . Definitely a great find !<->1
The Crispy Basil Chicken is to die for ! Spring rolls were awesome . Also had the panang curry and phad see ew . All dishes were outstanding !<->1
Food is very good . The at home feeling is spot on . You really feel like you 're at home at her kitchen table . The update food is unique and worth the wait .<->1
This place was the real deal . I am glad to be a Mississauga resident after visiting this place .<->1
Pretty good bbtea with different jelly flavors to choose from ( if you do n't want tapioca balls ) .<->1
Would give this place zero stars if I could . The cup they gave me to get my soda with had a cockroach in it . Totally disgusted . Never again !<->0
Great Food ! ! ! Excellent service ! Have been going for years ! A must try if your visiting and of course an old favorite for me !<->1
This place rocks ! The salmon poke bowl is out of this world . The service is beyond helpful and friendly . Very nice addition to the shopping center .<->1
Tried the smoke salmon salad and the poached pear on the Brunch Menu . Both were incredible ! I ca n't wait to go back . Such unique flavors and the atmosphere is perfect !<->1
The service and food was great as usual . Brook at the front was her wonderful self and Mary the manager was always around . Great job all .<->1
So delicious ! Must try the étouffée and bread pudding ! The restaurant offers complimentary valet and the staff is quite friendly .<->1
I ordered the chicken wrap and soooooo disappointed ! It does n't even look like chicken and it has a weird rubbery texture .<->0
The tasting room has no tables or chairs . It 's pretty dusty . You just stand around and sip , but at least it 's real glasses . The wines are so - so , nothing bad but nothing stood out . Nice people but pretty disorganized .<->2
Not what I expected from Cleo . The dishes that I enjoyed in Miami and LA were very poorly executed here . It was very very disappointing .<->0
Perfect meal with perfect service . The salad was fresh and delicious . The crab legs were sliced open and were served with butter over a flame . Server was as good as they come ! I hope to go back soon .<->1
Excellent new addition to Champaign / Urbana 's food scene . The pollo La Paz was a fantastic dish , he cheese melted on top made it special . The chips and salsa are unique and excellent . I 'll be back plenty !<->1
Have good dry vermicelli bowls . I guess they could add more flavors to make it taste better . The pork and beef vermicelli bowls are best . Just try to make it more flavorful .<->1
This place has fake reviews ! Bad service and bad food ! If I could I would give no star !<->0
This place is excellent ! Our waiter and the staff were helpful and attentive . The bone in rib eyes and lobster Wellington as well as the seafood appetizer were all prepared and cooked to perfection . We will be back !<->1
My family loves this little hole in the wall . Great authentic Mexican food and the staff is friendly ! We go once a week at least . They even know me now when I call for take out<->1
This is hidden gem ! ! Good place to experience traditional Korean food . This will be my new go to place for my Korean kick . Ca n't go wrong with the kalbi and the spicy squid . Service was good !<->1
Top notch customer service . Small place but that 's usually a sign of great food ! Great meat specialty pizza . I got a 18 " pizza . Teriyaki boneless wings were good as well !<->1
Try Pork Bone stew ! Just amazing . Great service and the price is right . I also love the free tea that comes with the dinner / lunch .<->1
Great breakfast food ! ! Had the bacon and eggs omelette .. loved it ! ! The grits and cheese amazing . All the food was fresh ! ! I will be back again .<->1
Have eaten twice from their food truck ! Great , authentic Mexican food ! ! ! The woman taking orders is so friendly and so is the cook . The guacamole is the best ever and so fresh ! ! Quantities are HUGE ! !<->1
Very good spot . Sushi is very good and the conveyor belt system allows you to sample anything you want without waiting . Strongly recommend .<->1
Do n't ever deliver food here . I ordered for myself only but it took more than an hour . It was just a dinner .. not like a family meal . Never ordering here again ...<->0
Have known the owner , Ian , since grade 3 and was so excited to check out his restaurant ! Fantastic experience , cozy atmosphere , very friendly staff ! Incredible food and beautifully executed . Can ' t wait to go back !<->1
Went for dinner with a friend , def a fan .<->1
The best late night food you could ask for . Classic diner atmosphere , matched with huge flavorful sandwiches and amazing milkshakes . I personally recommend the cornflake chicken , captain canuck and the clubhouse stack . The apple pie milkshake is to die for .<->1
It was a bit disappointing as I was expecting top notch napoletana pizza . Crust was overly soggy and not nearly as good as I have had at Versace pizzerias .<->2
I ordered the Phad Waan from here and it was really good . My girlfriend as always got papaya salad thai style with 3 peppers and downed that . Good place to go for a quick meal<->1
Clean store and will price match ... BUT will not give prices over the phone . Really ? !<->0
This is T . H . E . best BBQ in Chandler area . The rib and jalapenos sausages are my favorite . Cream corn is super yummy .<->1
It used to be a good place until they changed the server ! Food is not as good too anymore . Really bad . 4/4 / 17 4:30 pm<->0
I went to this place not too long ago . The severs were n't attentive . I practically had to wail my arms to get a refill ! The food was n't that great . I would n't go again .<->0
Every time I 've eaten here the food is been super delicious . The Panang curry and pad Thai here are our go - to options when we 're craving some good Thai food !<->1
The food is great and the service was nice , except I do n't why every time I came to visit there were ONLY WHITE PEOPLE .<->1
Finally made it and it was just OK ! Music was wayyyy tooooo loud . Plain waffle was very dry . Service was just OK . Will try one more time ... I think .<->0
Service was horrible , early afternoon not even busy . There were plenty of wait staff . I do n't think I 'll be back .<->0
We got chicken pho from here and the chicken was awful . Not only was it low quality chicken - it was stringy , chewy and fatty . I 've never had such terrible chicken in Pho . It was inedible .<->0
I went on a Wednesay with a collegue visitng from India that was craving hojmetown food . Little selection and way to salty . Some dishes were tasy and I appreciate the all - veginess , but was dissapointed .<->2
A touch of 90s Vegas in an otherwise 80s - style resort . The room , steaks , and service all remind you of a fun night out in Vegas . A great option if you are at the Phoenician or nearby .<->1
Probably the worst attempt art sushi I have ever tried . The fish smelled , there were flies in my saki and the server literally disappeared after dropping my food . I would avoid this place like the plague .<->0
I really love to eat at Basil Thai . I could eat here several times a week . Tom Yum Noodle soup with vegetables and tofu is simply delicious . I love Pad Kee Mao and many other dishes<->1
Another amazing lunch . Shrimp tacos were my favorite . Biloxi fried chicken sandwich , whole wheat veggie pizza and the backyard burger was delicious ... I am addicted to the Brookies and the Bread pudding .<->1
I 'm addicted to this place . I 'm here at least twice a week . I might have to start going to addiction meetings for this .<->1
Great burgers and hot dogs . Great customer service and fast deli every after 5 pm . Love Chubz ! !<->1
Wow ! ! ! The Churros are the shit ! Took 10 back for my co - workers . The burritos were super delicious as well<->1
Jewel made my daughters wedding cake . It was beautiful and delicious . Everyone raved about it .<->1
I went on a brewery tour ! It includes free beer and background info . of this factory . You ca n't go wrong with that !<->1
Service is slow and they hardly ever pick up the phone when I call which is just about everyday . But when they finally greet u they are nice<->2
Love this place ! I 've been coming here for years . Love their food and deserts ! Nice waterfront location and friendly staff !<->1
Cold beer , yummy pub fare . The B / T was very accommodating . The only bad part was watching my Packers lose .<->1
this place has great food.unfortunately it has ... long lines , a feeling of being rushed to get you in / out , and last night , warm beer while waited for my carryout.this place simply is n't a relaxing place to eat a meal .<->2
If your out on Mill partying , you should definitely eat here once your done . You do n't need another slice of pizza . You will thank yourself the next day .<->1
One of my favorite resturants in Phoenix . Their baby back ribs are incredible way better than any ribs I 've had in Texas<->1
I love this place , very comfortable environment and very pleasant service . I would recommend the bacon , beef , soup , and dessert .<->1
Excellent customer service . Prices were great . Lots of unique stuff . Definitely will be going back on a regular basis . Found what I was looking for quickly .<->1
Best place for service . My daughter has many food allergies and the staff accommodated everyone of them . Our server Andrea was a STAR . I recommend this place without hesitation . Food was fresh , hot and absolutely delicious .<->1
By far and away my favorite for asian food . Large menu to choose from . And they always seem to remember you there .<->1
Great atmosphere and candy ! Small and okay selection of ice cream . Great shake menu and pies and they kinda stuff :)<->1
Solid heavy handed pours and an awesome selection of cocktails . They muddle hard ... and I respect that !<->1
I must have gone on an off day , according to everyone elses review . Ordered the duck with rice . But instead got skin , bones and rice . And a bonus of shattered bones through my meal . Not pleasant .<->0
Nice atmosphere , nice staff , and nice food . Yeh pizza is filling but it 's delicious , i got really excited when I saw the red jalapeños . Pizza is fantastic , eat all of it because it does n't make great leftovers .<->1
Poor service . Food was taken away even we were not done , constantly asked if we were done even restaurant was empty , did n't pour us water , did n't give us tartar sauce ... not a good experience<->0
Yummmmmmmm ! Buffala pizza = bomb.com . The owner brings you this flaky desert and a shot of limoncello . Oh yeah , does n't get any better .<->1
We had the Cobb Salad and Steak salad last night . While my Cobb was great , the flavor from the cut of meat was Excellent . Next time it will be two Steak Salads ...<->1
Wir waren durch Zufall hier vor kurzem essen . Die Bedienung war sehr freundlich teilweise ein weniglangsam . Die Portionen waren sehr geizig , obwohl das Essen gut war , und das Brot für 4 Personen lachhaft . Ich muss hier nicht nochmal hin , schade .<->0
Decent sushi , good service . Beautiful dining . Any beef skewer or chicken skewer you get is mouth watering ! ! ! I will be back and I have been back lol . They need real stir fried veggies though ( asparagus , broccoli , etc )<->1
Friendly folks , hot quality coffees , cold ice cream , neighborhood atmosphere , ca n't beat it . F & B is our closest bestest coffee spot . Go local ! Get you some F & B<->1
This place is pretty great , just as good as the grog shop . I would say they 're about the same in my book . I 've never had a bad time at either one .<->1
This place has the best wings I 've ever had . They were my favorite in the old building and remain my favorite wing today .<->1
Service rapide et efficace . Menu pléthorique . Bonne qualité sans être exceptionnelle . Prix correct . On en sort jamais déçu ni chamboulé . Une valeure sûre<->1
Was told a 25 minute wait . 30 minutes later asked if we were close . 6 parties ahead of us . Left . Very disappointed .<->0
Although the hostess was very friendly , the wait staff was awful . The food was bland and tasteless .<->0
Unique Japanese cooking ! If you want to try a bunch of items ( more than one plate each ) I recommend ordering them one at a time as the tables are small and the food comes faster than you can finish !<->1
Great place to eat Thai food ... Try their garlic beef fry ... good quality food and great service ... Thai ice tea ... also<->1
Have not even tried anything other than the frozen custard yet , but my family can not say enough about the butter burgers . Ca n't wait to go there again !<->1
food is amazingly average ; manager was extremely rude . never wrote a yelp review before , but felt extremely inclined after this horrible experience . also they forgot to bring us all our orders .<->0
This place is a hidden gem . The food is sensational and very reasonably priced . The staff are very hospitable and accommodating . Highly recommend ! I 'll bring people back .<->1
I just ordered 3 pounds of their beef brisket ! ! It is so good ! ! Melt in your mouth , tender , AND super juicy ... I wo n't be ordering my brisket from ANYWHERE else , ANY TIME soon .<->1
This place was awesome ! ! ! The food portions are amazingly huge . Great wait staff and servers . First time here and I will definitely be back again ! ! So yummy !<->1
Food is great good to see a independent restaurant with a great product<->1
Awesome ! ! ! Love the favors and the deals ! ! ! Luv the tacos ! ! !<->1
A few times here ! Fun interaction and the food does n't disappoint . The pretzel is tasty and the beer matches !<->1
Amazing choice of South Indian food . First time there but will definitely be back for more . The sambar was outstanding .<->1
Brought my friend here while I was visiting Montreal . He never had Korean food before . He said he enjoyed it a lot . As for me , the food was good . Clean establishment and the service was good .<->2
Great ice cream . The young lady coming around offering water was a very nice touch . Need to empty the trash can on the patio .<->1
Mitch was incredible and honored my garlic knots ! ! Even though I made the mistake and my pie took care of it ! Above and beyond delicious food , great service ! ! !<->1
Amazing ! Great staff ! Great food ! It 's clean ! Everyone is welcoming ! If you get Jennifer as your server you really wo n't be disappointed ! I will be back again & again ! Great job guys !<->1
We are new in town and have tried several restaurants . Most are average . Spinato 's is exceptional ! The food and service was great . Delicious marinara , cheesy bread , and salad . We 'll return for sure !<->1
I love this place . Very fresh and affordable . I seem to always get the combo :)<->1
Whether it 's breakfast or lunch Worth Takeaway always exceeds my expectations . Their home made pastrami is wonderful . The home made chips are crisp and actually taste like potato chips . A great place to stop in for a delicious bite .<->1
Best breakfast place in The World ... love it ! The place has n't changed since they opened their doors in 1950 - somethin ' ... the best .<->1
Perfect ! The server was sweet and got drinks out quickly . The food came out quick hot and perfect . I would n't hesitate to come back . :)<->1
Great place for fast food . Burgers are cooked with flame grill and you choose your toppings , subway style . Fresh cut fries complete the meal . Will definitely come back !<->1
Hands down best steak ( ribeye ) I 've ever ever had . Nice seasoning and aged steak . Try garlic sauteed wild mushrooms and potato gratin . Yummy . Wish I was eating it right now .. Drool ...<->1
Uh - May - Zing ! This Greek restaurant checked every box : Great serviceDelicious foodTerrific pricesUnique atmosphereIf you re looking to go out to eat and keep it light simple with no need to dress to impress this is a great place to go .<->1
Best tacos in Arizona ! My favorite is the tacos pastor . Staff is attentive and friendly . Very clean and inviting . Taco lovers must visit !<->1
I love this place ! The presentation is 5 star alone , and then you get to taste the food ! The food makes me want to kiss the cook !<->1
We have a group from the office that frequent Bangkok a couple of times a month . It 's great food , great price . Lunch menu is excellent and service is prompt .<->1
Went here once , was pretty good , so I came back a second time and food was not anywhere close to what it was the first time . Unfortunately wo n't be back . Check out Greek wraps if you want great Greek .<->0
Who does n't love Cracker Barrel ? Ever time I come here it is always busy but that does n't detract from the service . Servers are always friendly and food is always good . Plus their store is always fun to browse<->1
The food is amazing staff friendly and ambiance welcoming and peaceful . My favorite thing in the menu are the grilled turkey chops . I have dined in and have done takeout and it has been consistently good .<->1
Italian beef is great . be warned if you get it wet with cheese it 's messy !<->1
I 've never had this style , but really liked it . The food was so fresh and healthy . I found it easy to stick to my diet here , and it was very tasty .<->1
Decent food , service was on the border of being below average . I would recommend finding something else unless you 're too drunk to walk any further .<->0
Decent food , nice bar atmosphere , and a fantastic bartender . She was a short Asian woman who lit up the bar . Lane or something . Great hang out spot !<->1
Ok not amazing as promised . No seasoning on the fish nor shrimp . Salad bar was mediocre . Could use some upgrading . The best part was the sweet tea and collard greens ( with lots of hot sauce ) .<->2
Nice little Italian place . Food and service are good . The prices are kind of high for what it is . I wish that they had more specials .<->1
Great tasting Puffs with different flavour combos ! Worth a look if you 're into pastry and donuts .<->1
Wow ordered 2 pizzas thinking with good reviews this would be a good spot ! Oh how I was wrong ! Worst pizza I 've ever had I would have been better off going to little Caesars ! Very disappointed ! !<->0
Great food ! A little pricey , so we just go for special occasions , but never disappointed .<->1
Not a lot of variety in ice cream flavors but this place is n't too bad . Good customer service<->1
This place is great . High - quality grass feed meat for great prices . The staff was knowledgeable and super helpful . This place is the real deal . If you are looking for a recommendation I highly suggest the sausage , namely the maple sage .<->1
If you want some good dole whip , this is the place to go ! ! Aside from phenomenal customer service , the place is clean . Great place for a nice date , or hang out after work after a long day !<->1
Came here for brunch ... got the assorted pastries ... they were yummy ! Especially the pecan one ... and the omelette was ok ...<->1
Came here for lunch buffet today . The staff explained different dishes , food was delicious and fresh & had excellent service ! Reasonably priced !<->1
Polite service , large portions , flavorful food . Prices are a little more than I 'm used to paying for Caribbean food but at least they give you a bunch . Wings are hearty and you can tell they 're marinated . Plantains were on point .<->1
Love the ordering process and pictures of what you get on an ipad . Great idea ! Eat it all .<->1
Wedge salad . A lot of toppings , drenched in blue cheese , like what a wedge should be everywhere else .<->1
Been here a bunch of times and it 's always been good . However I went the other day and got the Khao San Road ice cream . Got food poisoning about 2 hours later . Never going back .<->0
My husband and I are new to the area and love mexican food . We tried cocos loco and it was amazing ! Everything was delicious and our waiter Alex was great ! we will definitely be back !<->1
Bon café latté et grand format pour emporté . Par contre , n'acheter pas les cupcake fait maison , , , non frais et goût laisse à désirer .<->0
Incredibly upset with this place . Ordered my food three hours ago . Still has n't arrived . Called the place multiple times and told it was on the way . Not one apology for it being late . Never again<->0
Overall very good food . We have not eaten elsewhere yet but we think we will just stick with this place . Only thing is they did n't include the mustard and soy sauce so I you want some I would ask .<->1
Normally when I order salad , I do n't want my salad has tons of cheese , bitter vegetables , or olive . Joey just offered me my perfect salad ! This is so great , I will come as often as I can .<->1
Had lunch with my wife and we split the bbq chicken and a few beers from their tap . Plenty of choices and still our go to place for a really good sandwich ! ! ! Easy to get to location on Eastern .<->1
Cool spot for lunch outside on the strip with a great view , large portions so bring your appetite !<->1
The traditional BBQ sauce is very good . Whatever you order , make sure you get the pork belly pit beans . They are awesome . Less than a week in business . Give them time to earn that fifth star .<->1
A friend of mine took me here and now I ca n't stop thinking about it . I went crazy with about 4 - 5 flavors in one cup the first day , but am finding out my favorites . Very yummy and affordable !<->1
Wow , our first time here and the ambiance , the service , and the food was absolutely amazing . Shrimp Fra Diavlo was perfect - spicy and the fresh made pasta was to rave for ! ! We 'll be back ! ! No doubt !<->1
Cozy place to eat . Pizzas are fairly good , not greasy at all . I would highly recommend their shawarmas and fries combo .<->1
What can i say - its crepes , chocolate , caramel & other good stuff . And this place has pizza deserts ! WIN<->1
Yep ... another 5 star --- not for the food but , for the staff . What t team ! Go in at lunch and become a " Friend " - - - you will know it when it happens ~<->1
Ordered pizza for my salon , had a family of lady 's coming in to get there haircut and styled , we loved the pizza ! ! ! Great flavor ! !<->1
Customer service and the Triple B burger was the best . Highly recommend this burger and the floor manager made sure my family was well taken care of<->1
Been to the one at North York and definitely liked that better . Good selection of food , but pricey ( as with all izakaya ) . Service was good as we were the only table at the time . Will probably go back again .<->1
Horrible service with a waiter that badmouth the chef . Took them 30mins and 2 waiters to bring out just the soup . Will never eat at any of your chains .<->0
Food ... pretty good pizza . Food tastes fresh , weekday buffet is a pretty good deal . Nothing to complain about here . Ambiance ... ummm it 's definitely for kids but the place is always clean , including the restrooms . Staff ... always friendly and helpful . Verdict ... definitely take the kids here<->1
I love this restaurant . The atmosphere is quaint and the food is excellent ! My favorite date night spot in Chandler .<->1
This place is excellent ! The cannoli doughnuts are amazing as well as the chicken and waffles . Would highly recommend . Linda at the front is awesome and will do all she can to be sure you are satisfied with your meal .<->1
Huge portions and the food is always delicious . Recommend the spicy dumplings . The Sichuan Dan - Dan noodle is my favourite dish .<->1
Good food , reasonable price , bright and clean environment and friendly staff . great place for lunch dinner or late night !<->1
Great food and service . Never really busy . They make great martinis here . Kind of funny . I never thought an Asian restaurant would make a good martini .<->1
A great grocery full of northern european delicacies . If you are looking for something imported from europe or some special cut of meat / fish . It 's the place you should go .<->1
Order in advance i . e . overnight or a day if you 're craving for something specific like ' inihaw na pusit ' ( grilled squid ) . There will be days when they can get overwhelmed by a huge demand . Better be prepared than sorry .<->1
Really good steak . Service was a little slow . Otherwise would have given it 5stars . Love the bread options . Reasonably priced menu<->1
Really awesome place for a quick delicious bite ! So far I 've had the sushi - pretty good , Kat 's chicken - heck ya , yummy , and the sesame chicken - yummmm ! The service has been great too very friendly and love that they deliver !<->1
Great noodle bar will write a better review next time I 'm there . It was a bit of a rushed meal<->1
Full throttle bartending , and a cocktail menu that respects the classics as well as innovation .<->1
I ordered a thin crushed personal cheese pizza . A seemingly great value for a pizza at $ 6.68 . What I received looked like a box of paper thin nachos . Quite tasty . For a box of nachos anyway .<->2
You ca n't go wrong with a sandwich from here . I particularly love the BLT . Customer service is okay . I love that they appear to hire first time employees . They are very timid in their customer service , but are sweet .<->1
Try the Southwest Chicken salad !<->1
My last 2 visits the sushi bar had no sushi available or very minimal selection . Since they opened the quality has diminished from the grand opening . Hopefully things pickup or I 'll be eating elsewhere .<->0
Went for drinks & appitaziers last night . The service was A + the food was amazing . Reasonable prices . Great atmosphere . Ca n't wait to return .<->1
Great spot for groups , all of my experiences included slow service so be mentally prepared . The bread with the pesto dip is worth the calories ! Great selection of wine and " good " pasta for Arizona . Typical fox restaurant .<->1
I sampled 6 beers and they were all pretty good . I also tried the cider which was true to style . Friendly service too !<->1
Excellent homemade burgers . Great portions for the price .<->1
Good homemade soup and sandwhiches and a perfect amount of food for the price . Very welcoming and comforting as a first time customer . Would eat here again .<->1
excellent first time experience . the Nashville style hot chicken met all of my high expectations coming from a food city Seattle . the service and kindness of the staff was exceptional . beer selection better than expected as well . great cincept .<->1
Slowest Taco Bell ever . You have two people cooking and the rest are standing around doing nothing . The table that I sat at for 20 mins while I was waiting was filthy .<->0
Oh my God ! The burger was juicy , it was good . The fries were equally as good . I loved it so much ! ! The guys behind the counter are super helpfull , I see myself going back .<->1
Last night it took 30 minutes to get a dinner box . 30 minutes ? ! Why ? Employees did n't seem interested in doing their job and were moving slow as molasses . The food somehow was good . Good enough anyway<->0
Food was really good . The service was dissapointing . Servers are not organized nor very friendly / welcoming .<->2
This location is always out of Matcha . It 's now been two weeks . They should n't advertise on a big sign this drink if they do n't have it . I 've been getting it at Vons down the street , there never out .<->0
I love this place . The pizzas are the perfect size and the crust is tasty . I recommend the buffalo chicken pizza with bacon and the Nutella sweet bite .<->1
I went to hear live music . I enjoyed being able to bring in my own food and lawn chairs , while still sipping their beers . Fun spot !<->1
Everytime I ordered here the Pizza has been excellent , the service is great when they take your order . I usually call ahead now and get parmesean cheese crust and light sauce it taste so good .<->1
Jin - Ya is proof that good exists and wants us to be happy .<->1
I really feel that the service here has been better lately . Friendly staff , and the bagels are still great ! Also , they have iced coconut coffee for the season ! It 's like liquid caffeinated summer yumminess . Try it !<->1
Fresh corn tortillas are freakin the bomb . Salsas and the different meats . Been here several times and it has not disappointing . Another Superb Taco joint in the central line up .<->1
We celebrated our 25th wedding anniversary today ! ! ! Our wonderful server Scott H was very pleasant and knowledgeable about the food . The best meal yet ! ! ! Great experience . Ca n't wait to go back .<->1
The food and service are tops ! Probably the best friend chicken you will find in all of Nevada .<->1
So delicious , such a generous portion , fresh bread and great pasta sauce for dipping ! You have to eat a sandwich here ! ! $ 5 for a brekkie sandwich that is as big as your head . Ha !<->1
Listen , I 'm a huge fan of chocolate , and this place has my heart . Sooooo good .<->1
They finally opened so excited Just walked in place looks amazing The 2nd floor is insane Great crowed same happy hour menu Most of the old staff are still here Let 's do this<->1
Big fan . Great food , very pricey but worth every penny . We had a great time . Great service and great food .<->1
Great place to get a burger , fries ( personally i always substitute the mac n cheese bites ) and a milkshake in the Matthews area . Their Carolina Burger is really good for upscale fast food !<->1
One of the cutest coffee shops I 've been too here in Pittsburgh ! I ordered a Bianca and a breakfast sandwich and everything was delicious with a great price ! I will definitely be frequenting this place<->1
I love this placetry the coconut drink . nice atmosphere and food is great . Would recommend this place for sure<->1
Liked the small restaurant with the fantastic pizza ! Good service with knowledgeable servers about beer types .<->1
The pizza & cheese bread was delicious , and the dressing for the Greek salad was perfect . Delivery was fast . I 'll definitely order from here again .<->1
Wowzer . So dang good . My hubby definitely got his money 's worth ! Thankfully we got there before the huge rush , and the line was crazy long when we left .<->1
I love this place ! Great gyros , fast service , good portions , nice service . There 's a reason it gets packed at lunch ! ! !<->1
So delicious fresh bagels makes food right on the spot<->1
got vanilla with caramel salted something in a waffle cup . this is a crappy review because i ca n't remember the ice cream names but the outcome is amazing . go ! board games in the back .<->1
Friendly staff , nice decor and amazing food . Make sure you try the white chocolate cheesecake with filo .<->1
Very bad Had nothing to do with French food . Except for few French words on the menus maybe ! ! ! What a shame ...<->0
Good food , large portions on food however the Margaritas are small in size . The chips are really good , not a big fan on the Salsa .<->1
Best froyo in the city ! ! Only bad thing is that they are closed on the weekends they have a lot of toppings and mostly healthy . So if you are looking for a healthy treat this is your place<->1
Came in for lunch , service was very quick and accurate . Bartender Courtney was more than helpful with her suggestions for a build your own burger . Definitely will come back !<->1
Great food . The meat had great flavor . Only down side is that they kept confusing orders but that is something that does n't affect the food . Very quick service . I would definitely eat there again .<->1
Best HH ever ! 1/2 off of any bottle of wine and include the jalapeño dip with house made chips ... awesomeness !<->1
A friend of mine got a huge tray of sushi and sashmi from here , which we split for a board game night . Pretty good all around with lots of variety .<->2
Ok food at typical airport prices . Service was also ok . Truly nothing special but a small step up from airport fast food .<->2
